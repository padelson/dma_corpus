Equityholders' Representative are occasionally referred to herein as the
"parties." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of Parent, the Company and
Merger Sub have (i) determined that the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the "Merger") would be advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, their respective stockholders and (ii) approved the Merger upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement pursuant
to the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"); and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWHEREAS, based on the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company that the Merger would be advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, its stockholders, as promptly as practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, it is expected that the Stockholders
holding outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company necessary to
deliver the Requisite Stockholder Approval will deliver a written consent and
agreement of stockholders in the form attached as Exhibit A pursuant to
Section 228 of the DGCL, approving and adopting, among other things, this
Agreement and the Merger in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL (the
"Stockholder Consent"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.2 Merger Closing. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, 800 Boylston
Street, Boston, Massachusetts, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a Business Day to
be designated by Parent, but in no event later than the third Business Day
after the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party
or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in
writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date". \t\t

the Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date, the Company shall file
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger
(in any such case, the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
such Secretary of State or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each
Share that is owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary
of Parent (such Shares, the "Cancelled Shares") shall no longer be outstanding

no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Conversion of Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

  \t\t\t2  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding

except the right to receive the Per Share Closing Amount in accordance with

the Equityholders pursuant to Exhibit D. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares ("Dissenting Shares") of Company Common

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t3  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tPerson who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right
to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be
cancelled and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided
under Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such holder to receive those rights under
Section 262 shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the
right to receive, a portion of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
1.6(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.7 Payment of Merger Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
paying agent in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") pursuant to a
paying agent agreement providing for, among other things, the matters set
forth in this Section 1.7 and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to Parent.
Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall take all steps
necessary to enable and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to
the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account provided by the Paying Agent to Parent, cash necessary to pay (i) the
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable in consideration of the
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock converted into the
right to receive cash pursuant to Section 1.6(c), and (ii) the portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration payable in consideration of the Company Stock
Options and the Company Warrants converted into the right to receive cash
pursuant to Section 5.4 (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"); provided that the
amounts specified in the foregoing clause (ii) may instead be provided to the
Company's payroll provider in time for disbursement to employees who have
executed and delivered a Cancellation Agreement in the next regularly-
scheduled payroll to occur at least five Business Days after the Closing for
processing for those payees that are employees of the Company (and for
clarity, such funding may come from the Company's cash balances after the
funding of the Indemnity Escrow Amount as set forth in Section 1.9(a)). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause (x) the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (the "Certificates") which
were converted into the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6 (but only to the extent such holder has not previously
submitted a properly executed and duly completed Letter of Transmittal) (i) a
letter of transmittal in the form attached as Exhibit C and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for a portion of
the Merger Consideration (together, the "Letter of Transmittal") and (y) the
Surviving  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t4  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tCorporation to provide to each holder of Company Stock Options, or
Company Warrants, a Cancellation Agreement (but only to the extent such holder
has not previously submitted a properly executed and duly completed
Cancellation Agreement). Upon surrender of a Certificate, Company Stock
Option, or Company Warrant to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, for cancellation, together with such Letter of Transmittal or
Cancellation Agreement, as applicable, duly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, the holder of such Certificate, Company Stock Option, or Company
Warrant shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash
(i) into which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(c) (in accordance with the Allocation
Schedule), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled or
(ii) the holder of such Company Stock Option, or Company Warrant is entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 5.4 (in accordance with the Allocation
Schedule). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
1.7, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash,
without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 1.6. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or upon delivery of a
Cancellation Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms of this Article I as a result of the conversion of any shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, or cancellation of Company Stock
Options, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
or such Company Stock Options, as applicable. After the Effective Time there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, immediately prior to such date become the property of the Surviving
Corporation. Any cash remaining in the Exchange Fund  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t5  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tunclaimed by Equityholders as of the six-month anniversary of the
Closing Date (or such earlier date that is immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity) shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving
Corporation and become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto,
subject to the ongoing rights of any Equityholder entitled to payment of
Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article
I. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent. In no event, however, shall such investment or any such
payment of interest or income delay the receipt by the Equityholders of the
Closing Merger Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this Section
1.7, as applicable, or otherwise impair such Equityholders rights hereunder.
To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the
Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the Closing Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Section 1.7, as applicable, to all Equityholders,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such payments. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, and
provision of a customary indemnification of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
and delivery of a bond (in such sum as the Paying Agent may reasonably direct,
consistent with its prior practice) as surety for such indemnity, in each case
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, without
interest. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Paying Agent, or any successors or assigns thereof, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, including any Milestone Payments, such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or
under any provision of U.S. federal state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts
so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 1.8 Calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration;

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a statement (the
"Closing Statement") containing the Company's good faith calculation and
estimate of (i) (A) the Cash Amount, (B) the Indebtedness Amount, (C) the
Transaction Costs, (D) the Aggregate Exercise Amount, and (E) using the
amounts referred to in clauses (A) through (and including) (D), the Closing
Merger  \t\t

 \t\t\tConsideration (the "Closing Merger Consideration Calculation") and, in
each case, the components thereof accompanied by reasonable supporting detail
and documentation, (ii) a calculation of the Per Share Closing Amount based on
the Closing Merger Consideration Calculation, (iii) the updated Allocation
Schedule and (iv) the percentage and amount of the Closing Merger
Consideration that each Equityholder, as applicable, shall be entitled to
receive in accordance with the Allocation Schedule. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Closing Statement and components thereof shall be
subject to the review and comment of Parent and the final version of the
Closing Statement shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The Company and
Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to the
Closing Statement. From and after the date Parent receives the Closing
Statement until the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) make available to
Parent and its accountants and advisors the documents used in the preparation
of, or reasonably related to, the Closing Statement and (ii) give Parent
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
personnel, accountants, properties, books and records of the Company for such
purpose. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Upon prior reasonable notice from Parent in connection with
any payment of any Milestone Payments to the Equityholders, the Equityholders'
Representative will deliver to Parent (and to the Paying Agent, as
appropriate) an updated Closing Statement that reflects such contemplated
payment of any Milestone Payments to Equityholders. \t\t

At the Closing, (i) the Company shall pay (or upon request of the Company,

to the Persons to which Transaction Costs are owed, the sums necessary to pay
such Transaction Costs in accordance with wire transfer instructions provided
by such Persons prior to the Closing, (ii) the Company shall deposit or cause

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Other than pursuant to a Company Material Contract listed in

to, all Intellectual Property used in the conduct of its business as now
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, including all materials and
components related to the Company's products and product candidates in their
current form, including cell lines, plasmids, vectors, required reagents and
similar materials and components used in the development and manufacture of,

Company has not received any written (or to the Company's Knowledge, oral)
notices or claims alleging that the Company has interfered with, infringed
upon, violated or misappropriated any of the Intellectual Property rights of
any other Person (including any written (or to the Company's Knowledge, oral)
claim that the Company must license or refrain from using any Intellectual
Property). No employee of the Company is obligated under any Contractual
Obligation (including licenses, covenants or commitments of any nature) or
other agreement, or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative agency, that would interfere with the use of his or her best
efforts to promote the interests of the Company or that would conflict with
the Company's business as presently conducted. To the Company's Knowledge,
the business of the Company as currently conducted does not require the use of
any inventions of any of the Company's employees made prior to or outside the
scope of their employment by the Company. As of the Agreement Date, no
Company Owned Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding consent,
settlement, decree, order, injunction, judgment or ruling of a Governmental
Entity, or, other than pursuant to the terms of any agreement set forth in
Section 2.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, any Contractual Obligation,
restricting or otherwise materially limiting Company's exploitation thereof in
the conduct of its business as presently conducted. To the Company's
Knowledge, no other Person has misappropriated, infringed or otherwise
violated any Company Owned Intellectual Property or any Third-Party
Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to the Company.  \t\t

Owned Intellectual Property and, to the extent the Company is contractually
obligated to do so, any other Company Intellectual Property, and to maintain
in confidence all know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information
comprising a part thereof (other than confidential information that the
Company determined prior to the Closing no longer derives its value by being
kept confidential and opted to no longer maintain the confidentiality of such
information provided that such disclosure would not be reasonably likely to
have an adverse effect on Parent's rights or interests). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Other than the agreements identified in Section 2.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company is not a party to any options,

to use or exploit the Company Intellectual Property or Third-Party
Intellectual Property that is exclusively licensed to the Company. Except as
provided in the agreements identified in Section 2.11 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company is not obligated to indemnify any third party
against a charge of infringement of Intellectual Property. \t\t

loss, misappropriation, misuse or acquisition of, any Sensitive Data

corporation with which the Company is Affiliated or with which the Company has
a business relationship, or any firm or corporation that competes with the
Company, except that such Persons may own stock in publicly traded companies

immediate family is directly or indirectly interested in any Company Material
Contract with the Company. For clarity, this Section 2.12 does not apply with
respect to other portfolio companies owned by any venture capital, private
equity or angel investor in the Company to which it would otherwise apply by
reason of such ownership. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.13 Permits. The Company has all material franchises,
permits, licenses, and any similar authority necessary for the conduct of its

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.14 Environmental and Safety Laws. To the Company's
Knowledge, the Company is not in violation of any applicable statute, law or

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.17 Financial Statements. The Company has delivered to
Parent its audited financial statements (balance sheet and income and cash
flow statements, including notes thereto) at December 31, 2016 (the "Financial
Statement Date") and December 31, 2015, and, in each case, for the fiscal year
then ended, and its unaudited financial statements (balance sheet and income
statement) as at and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 (the
"Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated and with each other, except that the unaudited Financial Statements
may not contain all footnotes required by U.S. GAAP and may be subject to
normal year-end audit adjustments, in each case, which are not material in the
aggregate. The Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects
the financial condition and operating results of the Company as of the dates,
and for the periods, indicated therein, subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments in the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements which are not
material in the aggregate. Except as set forth in the Financial Statements,
the Company has no material liabilities of any nature (whether absolute,
accrued, matured or unmatured, fixed, contingent or otherwise) other than (a)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business subsequent to the
Financial Statement Date, (b) liabilities for Transaction Costs, (c)
liabilities arising under Contractual Obligations, (d) such other liabilities
that do not, in the aggregate, exceed $2 million, and (e) liabilities set
forth on the balance sheet prepared by the Company as of the Financial
Statement Date. For clarity, the mere existence of a claim, complaint or
notice from a third party involving the Company arising after the Agreement
Date shall not constitute a breach of this Section 2.17 on the theory that
such claim or the matters underlying such claim (absent an underlying breach
of another applicable representation, warranty or covenant) constitute an
unmatured, contingent or other liability, debt or obligation of the Company.
Except as disclosed in the Financial Statements, the Company is not a
guarantor or indemnitor of any Indebtedness of any other Person. The Company
maintains a standard system of accounting established and administered in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.  \t\t

potential sale of the Company), (ii) there has not been any Company Material
Adverse Effect and (ii) there has not been: \t\t

independent contractors is obligated under any Contractual Obligation
(including licenses, covenants or commitments of any nature) or other
agreement, or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative agency, that would materially interfere with such employee's or
independent contractor's ability to promote the interest of the Company or
that would conflict with the Company's business. Neither the execution or
delivery of this Agreement nor the carrying on of the Company's business by
the employees or independent contractors of the Company, nor the conduct of
the Company's business as now conducted will, to the Company's Knowledge,
conflict with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions, or provisions
of, or constitute a default under, any Contractual Obligation, covenant or
instrument under which any such employee or independent contractor is now
obligated.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Company is not delinquent in payments to any of its

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The Company has not incurred, and to the Company's
Knowledge, no circumstances exist under which the Company would reasonably be

Labor Standards Act or applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) The employment of each employee of the Company is

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Section 2.19(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists (i)
all Company Benefit Plans and all Company Benefit Agreements (whether legally
enforceable or not, whether formal or informal and whether in writing or not).
The Company has no express or implied commitment to (x) create, incur
liability with respect to, or cause to exist any other employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement, (y) enter into any Contractual Obligation or
agreement to provide compensation or benefits to any individual or (z) modify,

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) None of the Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit
Agreements provides for the payment of separation, severance, termination or
similar benefits to any Person or obligates the Company to pay separation,
severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely or partially as a
result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a
"change in ownership or control," within the meaning of such term under
Section 280G of the Code. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions, either alone or together
with another event, will (i) result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute,
forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due under any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or otherwise, whether or not such
payment is contingent, other than as may be required under applicable Law at
no additional cost to the Company, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any arrangement, (iii) affect any Company Benefit Plan's or

combination relating to the Company or (iii) any recapitalization,
reorganization or any other extraordinary business transaction involving or

anticipation of a potential acquisition of the Company destroy such
information. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Promptly following the execution and delivery hereof, the
Company shall distribute to Stockholders holding at least the number and class
of Shares sufficient to provide the Requisite Stockholder Approval the
proposed Stockholder Consent. The Company shall encourage such Stockholders
to execute the Stockholder Consent and deliver such executed Stockholder
Consent to the Company within 8 hours following the execution and delivery
hereof. Upon obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company shall
so notify Parent and shall provide to Parent a certificate of the Company's
secretary certifying as to such vote on behalf of the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) As promptly as practicable after the receipt by the Company
of Stockholder Consents executed by Stockholders sufficient to satisfy the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days following the date hereof, the Company shall, in accordance with
applicable Law, including Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL, the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws and the other Organizational Documents of the
Company, promptly send (x) an information statement (the "Information
Statement") to each Stockholder that has not theretofore executed the
Stockholder Consent notifying him, her or it that (i) action has been taken by
less than unanimous written consent of the Stockholders, (ii) this Agreement
was duly adopted and (iii) appraisal rights are available pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL, (y) a Letter of Transmittal to each Stockholder and (z) a
Cancellation Agreement to each holder of a Company Stock Option, or Company
Warrant. Such notice shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and
shall at all relevant times be in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL and
Law. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all
Equityholders to deliver their Letters of Transmittal, Cancellation Agreements
and any other required documentation thereunder as promptly as practicable
following the distribution of such Information Statement. If, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall exercise, or cause to
be exercised, all rights available to it under Section 3 of the Company  \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality. The
Company shall afford to Parent and to Parent's Representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours (under the supervision of appropriate
personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operation of the business of the Company) during the period prior to the
Effective Time to all their respective properties, books and records and
Contractual Obligations and, during such period, the Company shall furnish, as
promptly as practicable, to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however,
that any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with affording such access or furnishing such information shall be
reimbursed by Parent. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company shall not be required to afford access or furnish information to the
extent (a) relating to the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board
(including any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the Company
Board) where the Company Board discussed the Transactions or any similar
transaction between the Company and any other Person or (b) the Company
determines in good faith that affording such access or furnishing such
information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company,
violate applicable Law or result in significant antitrust risk for the
Company; provided, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), that the Company shall
inform Parent that information or access is being withheld and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements to afford
such access or furnish such information without breaching such confidentiality
agreement, jeopardizing such attorney-client privilege, violating applicable
Law or resulting in such antitrust risk, as applicable (including, in the case
of privileged materials, entering into a customary common interest agreement).
All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement dated March 7, 2017 between the Company and Parent
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"). \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers and consents from,
the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with and
the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid a Proceeding
by any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions,
(ii) the defending or contesting of any Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed
and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; provided that the parties hereto understand and agree that the
reasonable best efforts of Parent and Merger  \t\t

 \t\t\tSub shall not be deemed to include (A) divesting or otherwise holding
separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other
action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any
of its or the Company's or any of their respective Affiliates' businesses,
assets or properties if such action is required by a Governmental Entity in
connection with the completion of or as a result of the Transactions or (B)
entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or
agreement with any Governmental Entity if required in connection with the
completion of the Transactions (each action or condition described in clause
(A) or (B), a "Burdensome Condition"). In addition, the Company shall not
accept any of the Burdensome Conditions or take any of the actions set forth
in the proviso to the preceding sentence without Parent's prior written
consent or direction, which consent or direction shall not be unreasonably
withheld, in which case the Company shall accept any such conditions or take
any such actions as directed by Parent; provided that the Company shall not be
required to accept any such Burdensome Conditions or take any such actions
that are not conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions. In connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board
shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction
or this Agreement and (B) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the
Transactions and this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties' obligations
under Section 5.3(a), and in furtherance thereof, Parent and the Company
shall, or shall cause its ultimate parent entity as that term is defined in
the HSR Act to, in consultation and cooperation with the other and as promptly
as practicable, (i) (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement), file with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ")
the notification and report form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the
Merger or any of the other Transactions. Any such filings shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Parent
and the Company shall, or shall cause its ultimate parent entity as that term
is defined in the HSR Act to, (i) furnish to the other party such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act, (ii) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any
such filings (other than documents responsive to Item 4(c) or Item 4(d) of the
HSR notification) or submissions and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of
any communication with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other Governmental Entity regarding
the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and permit the other party to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and
secure the participation of, the other party in connection with, any such
filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or requests, (iii) unless
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, and to
the extent reasonably practicable, (A) not participate in or attend any
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Entity in respect of the Merger or any of the other Transactions without the
other party, (B) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such
meeting or conversation, (C) in the event one party is prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity from participating in
or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such
party apprised with respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the  \t\t

correspondence or other written communications explaining or defending this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections
made by any Governmental Entity and (E) furnish the other party with copies of
all filings (other than documents responsive to Item 4(c) or Item 4(d) of the
HSR notification), submissions, correspondence and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity or members of any Governmental Entity's staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and (iv)
comply with any reasonable inquiry or request from the FTC, the DOJ or any
other Governmental Entity as promptly as reasonably practicable. Any such
additional information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act. The parties may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other under this Section 5.3 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the party providing such materials. Parent agrees not to extend, directly or
indirectly, any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement
with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the Merger or any of
the other Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the Company,
which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to Parent's
obligations set forth in this Section 5.3, Parent shall have the right to
direct all antitrust and competition matters with any Governmental Entity
consistent with its obligations hereunder and Parent shall have the principal
responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
necessary antitrust or competition clearances and shall take the lead in all
meetings and communications with any Governmental Entity in connection with
obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition clearances. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) To the extent reasonably requested by Parent, and subject to
the limitations on its obligation to provide information set forth in Section
5.2, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and
provide the Parent with such information as Parent may reasonably request with
respect to: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) any preparation of pro-forma financial statements or any
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Company's financial
statements which may be required in connection with the Transactions,
including, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consents from its independent auditors to the
filing of such auditor's opinions on such financial statements and any
representations or certifications from the Company's management team that may
be required or reasonably requested in connection therewith; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

Company shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be
required to effect the following: \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, to the
extent vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (after
giving effect to any vesting acceleration triggered by the terms of the Merger
or otherwise (including without limitation to any action of the Company Board
that may be taken prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of
the Company Stock Plan)) (each, a "Vested Company Option") shall be cancelled,
with the former holder of such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to
receive an amount in cash equal to (x) (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per
Share Closing Amount over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such vested portion of Company Stock
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) with respect
to any Milestone Payments described in Exhibit D, an amount equal to the then-
applicable Per Share Milestone Payment Amount multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such vested portion of such Company
Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that no Milestone Payment shall be paid to a former holder of a
Company Stock Option not earned by the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time
unless such Milestone Payment shall not result in adverse Tax consequences to
Parent or such former holder of a Company Stock Option under Section 409A of
the Code and the Treasury regulations and applicable guidance promulgated
thereunder ("Section 409A"), as determined by Parent, and (z) the Per Share
Escrow Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such vested portion of such Company Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case as provided on the
Allocation Schedule. Except as set forth in Section 5.4(a)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company Board shall accelerate all of the otherwise
then-unvested Company Stock Options prior to giving effect to this Section
5.4. It is intended that each Milestone Payment be treated as a "separate
payment" for purposes of Section 409A. It is further intended that each
Milestone Payment satisfy, as applicable and to the greatest extent possible,
the "short-term deferral" exemption provided under Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(b)(4). To the extent a Milestone Payment is not exempt as a "short-
term deferral" as provided for in the previous sentence, it is intended that
each Milestone Payment satisfy, as applicable and to the greatest extent
possible, the rules regarding "certain transaction-based compensation"
provided under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A). Although it
is intended that each Milestone Payment be exempt from, or comply with,
Section 409A, none of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall have any liability to any Option Holder
or to any other Person with respect to Section 409A; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option to the
extent set forth in Section 5.4(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
having an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock equal to or greater
than the Per Share Closing Consideration, shall be cancelled without the
payment of any consideration to the holder thereof; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) at the Effective Time, each Company Warrant, to the extent
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled, with
the former holder of such Company Warrant becoming entitled to receive an
amount in cash equal to (x) (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share
Closing Amount over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (y) with respect to any Milestone Payments
described in Exhibit D,  \t\t

Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(z) the Per Share Escrow Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, in each case as provided on the Allocation Schedule;
and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be
subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without
interest. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, Parent and
their respective subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Company Stock
Options pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so
deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the
appropriate committee thereof shall terminate the Company Stock Plan and all
rights thereunder, including all Company Stock Options, and under any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any
interests in respect of Company Common Stock, in each case, effective as of
the Effective Time and, in each case, without liability to Parent, other than
the obligation to pay the amounts contemplated by this Section 5.4. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Subject to Section 5.4(b), promptly following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to
Section 5.4(a) to the former holders of Company Stock Options and Company
Warrants, as applicable in accordance with Section 1.7(b) and as set forth on
the Allocation Schedule. \t\t

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights to advancement of
expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective
Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a
director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to
an employee benefit plan) of the Company or any of its predecessors (each, an

without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of
this Section 5.5 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to which each Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
Law, Contractual Obligation or otherwise. \t\t

Merger and the other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except (i) as

threatened by a stockholder against the Company or its directors relating to
any Transaction and shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably informed
regarding any such Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any such Proceeding and shall
give due consideration to Parent's views with respect thereto; provided,
however, that the Company shall control such defense and this Section 5.8
shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense; and provided further,
that no settlement of any such Proceeding shall be agreed to without Parent's
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

Code and the regulations thereunder, any payments and benefits that may
separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination shall
be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Parent,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such
that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G
Payments, and prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
notification and documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent that (i) a
vote of the Stockholders was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite stockholder
approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were
subject to the stockholder vote (the "280G Stockholder Approval") or (ii) that
the 280G Stockholder Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such
payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they
would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the
waivers from the intended recipients of the Section 280G Payments that were
executed by the affected individuals prior to the solicitation of the vote of
the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 5.10. The Company shall provide to
Parent, at least  \t\t

Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (a) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate such that the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a) could not be
satisfied, in each case at any time from and after the date of the Agreement
until the Effective Time or (b) any material failure of the Parent and the
Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section
6.3(a) could not be satisfied, in each case at any time from and after the
date of this Agreement until the Closing Date; provided, that unintentional
failure to give notice under this Section 5.12 shall not be deemed to be a
breach of covenant under this Section 5.12 and shall constitute only a breach
of the underlying representation, warranty, covenant, condition or agreement,
as the case may be. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.12 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to
such party's obligation to consummate the Merger. \t\t

that all qualifications contained in this Agreement and each such Schedule or
certificate as to materiality, including each qualifying reference to the
defined term "Company Material Adverse Effect", the phrase "substantial
compliance", and the words "material", "material to the Company" and
"materially," were deleted therefrom (provided that for clarity, this
parenthetical will not operate to make references to "Company Material
Contract" into "Contract" or "Material Adverse Effect" into "Effect")); \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of the

not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) in respect of
Losses arising from the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty described therein unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
Losses incurred or suffered by the Parent Indemnified Persons exceeds

Person"), from, against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by the Equityholder Indemnified Persons or any of them as a result
of, arising out of or relating to: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) any fraud on the part of Parent or Merger Sub (or any
Affiliate or Representative thereof) with respect to any breach of, or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of either of
the Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
or on behalf of either Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.2 of this
Agreement (in each case, assuming that all qualifications contained in this
Agreement and each such Schedule or certificate as to materiality, including
each qualifying reference to the phrase "substantial compliance", the words
"material" and "materially" and all similar phrases and words were deleted
therefrom); or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of
Parent or Merger Sub. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Monetary Limitations. Parent will have no obligation to
indemnify the Equityholder Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)
in respect of Losses arising from the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation, warranty or statement described therein unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred or suffered by the Equityholder
Indemnified Persons exceeds $2,000,000 (at which point the Parent will
indemnify the Equityholder Indemnified Persons for all such Losses in excess
of such amount), and the Parent's aggregate liability in respect of claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) will not exceed the Cap;
provided, that the foregoing limitations will not apply to (a) claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) in respect of breaches of, or
inaccuracies in, the Parent Fundamental Representations or (b) claims based
upon fraudulent breach of such representation or warranty. Claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) in respect of breaches of, or
inaccuracies in, the Parent Fundamental Representations will not exceed the
amounts paid or payable hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.3 Other Limitations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Any Losses as to which indemnification provided for in this
Article VIII may apply shall be determined net of any cash recovery actually
received by an Indemnified Person with respect to insurance or third party
indemnification or contribution specifically with respect to the specific
matter for which indemnification is sought, less any documented current or
prospective costs associated with obtaining such recovery. If an Indemnified
Person receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies or third party
indemnification or contribution payments subsequent to its receipt of an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t46  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(including via the Indemnity Escrow Amount or set off against
Milestone Payments), then such Indemnified Party will, without duplication,
promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any indemnification payment made
by the Indemnifying Party up to the amount received by the Indemnified Person
(less any documented current or prospective costs associated with obtaining
such recovery). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Any claim for Losses will be calculated without regard to
any damages (i) which are punitive or exemplary or (ii) which are not
reasonably foreseeable under an objective standard, except in each case to the
extent awarded by a Governmental Entity pursuant to a Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Any claim for indemnification under Section 8.1(a)(i)-(iv)
against the Equityholders, and any offer to compromise or settle such claim,
must be made on a pro rata basis to all Equityholders (based on their
respective Pro Rata Portions). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company is not making and shall not be construed to have made, and the
Equityholders shall not have any liability or indemnification obligation with
respect to, any representation or warranty as to the amount or availability of
any net operating losses, Tax credits, or other Tax attribute.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Equityholders shall
not have any liability or indemnification obligation (i) resulting from any
election made under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Transactions
(ii) for any Taxes of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries resulting from
any action taken by the Company or Parent after the Closing on the Closing
Date or (iii) the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates to utilize any Tax asset or attribute (e.g., net operating loss
carryforward or Tax credit carryforward) in any Tax period or portion thereof
beginning on or after the Closing Date. This Section 8.3(d) shall not apply
to any liability or indemnification obligation of the Equityholders in
connection with a breach of, or inaccuracy in, or violation of, Section
2.20(i) or Section 4.1(j) by the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Any liability for indemnification under this Article VIII
shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of
facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach or other violation
of more than one representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, certificate or
certification. In addition, if and solely to the extent that an amount of
Losses in connection with an indemnifiable matter was already taken into
account in connection with calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration,
the same amount of such Losses may not be recovered under this Article
VIII. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.4 Time for Claims; Notice of Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Time for Claims. No claim may be made or suit instituted
seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i)-(iv) or 8.2(a)(i) unless
a written notice is provided to the Indemnifying Party at any time prior to
the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date. No claim may
be made or suit instituted seeking indemnification pursuant to Section
8.1(a)(v) unless a written notice is provided to the Indemnifying Party at any
time prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for
breach of contract. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Written Notice of Indemnification Claims. In the event that
any Indemnified Person wishes to make a claim for indemnification under this
Article VIII, the Indemnified Person shall give written notice of such claim
to each Indemnifying Party (with all notices to the Equityholders being given
to the Equityholders' Representative within the applicable time limitations
contained in Section 8.4(a)). Any such notice shall describe the breach or
inaccuracy and other material facts and circumstances upon which such claim is
based and the estimated amount of Losses involved, in each case, in reasonable
detail in light of the facts then known to the Indemnified Person; provided,
that no defect in the information contained in such notice from the
Indemnified Person to any Indemnifying Party will relieve such Indemnifying
Party from any obligation under this Article VIII, except to the extent such
failure to include information actually and materially prejudices such
Indemnifying Party. \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.5 Third Party Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Notice of Third Party Claims. Promptly after receipt by an
Indemnified Person of written notice of the assertion of a claim by any Person
who is not a party to this Agreement (a "Third Party Claim") that would give
rise to a claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this
Article VIII, the Indemnified Person shall give written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party; provided, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Person in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any obligation under this Article VIII, except to the extent such delay
actually and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Assumption of Defense, etc. The Indemnifying Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the
subject of a notice given by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person pursuant
to Section 8.5(a). Upon request, the Indemnified Person will give the
Indemnifying Party copies of complaints, pleadings, notices and material
communications with respect to such Third Party Claim (subject to execution a
customary form of non-disclosure agreement if such an agreement is not already
in place). In addition, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend
the Indemnified Person against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person so long as (i) the
Indemnifying Party gives written notice that they or it will defend the Third
Party Claim to the Indemnified Person within fifteen (15) days after the
Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third Party Claim under Section
8.5(a) stating that the Indemnifying Party will, and thereby covenants to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Person from and against
the entirety of any and all Losses the Indemnified Person may suffer resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third
Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Person with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person that the
Indemnifying Party will have adequate financial resources to defend against
the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder,
(iii) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Person, (iv) the
Indemnified Person has not been advised by counsel that an actual or potential
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified Person and the
Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim as
a result of different defenses available to them, (v) the Third Party Claim
does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with any criminal or
regulatory enforcement Proceeding or Tax contests, (vi) settlement of, an
adverse judgment with respect to, or conduct of the defense of the Third Party
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t48  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tClaim by the Indemnifying Party is not, in the good faith judgment of
the Indemnified Person, reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the
Indemnified Person's reputation or continuing business interests (including
its relationships with current or potential customers, suppliers or other
parties material to the conduct of its business) and (vii) the Indemnifying
Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently.
The Indemnified Person may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim; provided,
that the Indemnifying Party will pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel
retained by the Indemnified Person that are incurred prior to the Indemnifying
Party's assumption of control of the defense of the Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Limitations on Indemnifying Party Control. The Indemnifying
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
compromise or settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Person unless such judgment,
compromise or settlement (i) provides for the payment by the Indemnifying
Party of money as sole relief for the claimant, (ii) results in the full and
general release of all Indemnified Person from all liabilities arising or
relating to, or in connection with, the Third Party Claim and (iii) involves
no finding or admission of any violation of Law or the rights of any Person
and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified
Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Indemnified Person's Control. (1) If the Indemnifying Party
does not deliver the notice contemplated by clause (i) of Section 8.5(b), or
the evidence contemplated by clause (ii) of Section 8.5(b), within fifteen
(15) days after the Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third Party
Claim pursuant to Section 8.5(a), or otherwise at any time fails to conduct
the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, or (2) if such
notice and evidence is given on a timely basis and the Indemnifying Party
conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently but any
of the other conditions in Section 8.5(b) is or becomes unsatisfied, then in
each case the Indemnified Person may defend, and may consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the
Third Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by
the entry of any such judgment consented to, or any such compromise or
settlement effected, without its prior written consent (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being understood and
agreed that it shall be reasonable for the Indemnifying Party to withhold such
consent if it believes in good faith that there is not any underlying basis
for indemnification with respect to such judgment, compromise or settlement)).
In the event that the Indemnified Person conducts the defense of the Third
Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.5(d), the Indemnifying Party will
remain responsible for any and all Losses that the Indemnified Person may
incur or suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or caused by the
Third Party Claim to the extent such Losses are otherwise indemnifiable as
provided in this Article VIII (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article VIII). \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.6 Sources for Indemnification.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Any Losses for which a Parent Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnification (as determined according to the procedures in this Article
VIII) pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i)-(iv) may only be satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, which will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
therefor other than pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Any Losses for which a Parent Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnification (as determined according to the procedures in this Article
VIII) pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(v) shall, at the option of the Parent, be
satisfied (i) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds by the
breaching Equityholder, (ii) by way of set off against a Milestone Payment
(via deduction from payments otherwise payable to such Equityholder) or (iii)
by set off against amounts otherwise to be released to such Equityholder from
the Indemnity Escrow Amount maintained pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement; provided that the maximum liability of any Equityholder will be the
amounts actually received or receivable by such Equityholder hereunder
(inclusive of such Equityholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Cap). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.7 Exclusive Remedies. The parties acknowledge and
agree that, following the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims for any breach of any representation, warranty,
statement, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII.
For clarity, this means that the survival and claim periods and liability
limits set forth in this Article VIII shall control notwithstanding any
statutory or common law provisions or principles to the contrary. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Indemnified Person hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under any Laws, any and all Proceedings for any
breach of any representation, warranty, statement, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein it may have against the Indemnifying Parties and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article VIII. Nothing in this Section 8.7 shall limit any
Person's liability for fraud personally committed by such Person. \t\t

constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) except for Section 5.5, are not intended to

 \t\t\t(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, (1) except
for the representations and warranties contained in Article II, neither the
Company nor any Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or with respect

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in

 \t\t\tSection 9.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that (i) Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger
Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) Parent may
collaterally assign any or all of its rights (but not obligations) hereunder
to any provider of debt financing, and (iii) Parent may assign any or all of
its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates, but
no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this
Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.
Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.9 Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement that are
required to be performed prior to or at the Closing were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement prior to or at the Closing and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
which are required to be performed prior to or at the Closing in any court
referred to in Section 9.9(b), without the necessity of proving the inadequacy
of money damages as a remedy (and each party hereby waives any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The right to seek specific enforcement shall include the right of
each party to cause the other party to cause the Merger and the other
Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement (and Parent acknowledges that in the event such remedy
is unavailable for any reason, the recoverable monetary damages of the Company
hereunder shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, but rather shall include without limitation the benefit of the bargain
lost by the Equityholders (including any lost premium), taking into
consideration all relevant factors (including the total amount payable to the
Equityholders hereunder and the time value of money), which in each case shall
be deemed to be damages of the Company and shall be recoverable by the Company
on behalf of the Equityholders). The parties further agree, with respect to
obligations required to be performed prior to or at the Closing, not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges
and agrees that the right of specific enforcement of obligations arising prior
to or at the Closing is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without such right, none of the parties would have entered
into this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, if such court shall be unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other  \t\t

 \t\t\tTransactions, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims with respect to such Proceeding may be heard and determined
exclusively in such court. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable, any state or Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware) in the event any Proceeding arises out of
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the
service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, on behalf of itself or
its property, by U.S. registered mail to such party's respective address set
forth in Section 9.1 (provided that nothing in this Section 9.9(b) shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law or shall limit the notice obligations under Section 9.1) and
(iv) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other Transactions in any court other than the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable,
any state or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). The parties
hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law; provided, however, that nothing in
the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment
relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding arising out of this
Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction. Each party hereto (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this
Section 9.10. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.11 Equityholders' Representative. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement
by the Equityholders and without any further action of any of the
Equityholders or the Company, the Company hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Fortis Advisors LLC as the Equityholders' sole, exclusive, true and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Equityholders' Representative"), and
each Equityholder irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Equityholders
Representative as his/her/its sole, exclusive, true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution to act in such
Equityholder's name, place and stead with respect to all transactions
contemplated by and all terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and to act on such Equityholder's behalf in any dispute, litigation
or arbitration involving this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to do or
refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and execute all such
documents, on such Equityholder's behalf, as the Equityholders' Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the power:
(i) to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and any and
all amendments, waivers or modifications hereof and thereof; (ii) to waive any
condition to the obligations of such Equityholder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow  \t\t

 \t\t\tAgreement and the Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement;
(iii) to execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, certificates and
documents, and to make representations and warranties therein, on behalf of
such Equityholder that the Equityholders' Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Equityholders'
Representative Engagement Agreement; (iv) with respect to any claims for
indemnification made by Parent hereunder, agree to, object to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand litigation of and comply
with orders and awards of courts with respect to such claims; (v) with respect
to any disputes regarding Milestone Events or otherwise hereunder, agree to,
object to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
litigation of and comply with orders and awards of courts and arbitrators with
respect to such disputes; and (vi) to do or refrain from doing any further act
or deed on behalf of such Equityholder as is assigned, delegated or charged to
the Equityholders' Representative or that the Equityholders' Representative
otherwise deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement, as fully and completely as
such Equityholder could do if personally present. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Equityholders' Representative shall have no obligation to act
on behalf of the Equityholders, except as expressly provided herein, in the
Escrow Agreement and in the Equityholders' Representative Engagement
Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the
Equityholders' Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or
the Company Disclosure Letter, other than pursuant to Exhibit D. All such
actions set forth or described in this Section 9.11(a) will be deemed to be
facts ascertainable outside this Agreement and will be binding on the
Equityholders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Equityholders' Representative hereunder (i) are deemed coupled
with an interest and will be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Equityholder and shall be binding on any
successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Equityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund. Parent, its Affiliates and any other Person may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the
Equityholders' Representative on behalf of the Equityholders in all matters
referred to herein. All notices delivered by Parent or the Company (following
the Closing) to the Equityholders' Representative (whether pursuant hereto or
otherwise) for the benefit of the Equityholders will constitute notice to the
Equityholders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Equityholders' Representative will act for the
Equityholders on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner
the Equityholders' Representative believes to be in the best interest of the
Equityholders as a whole and consistent with its obligations under this
Agreement, but neither the Equityholders' Representative, nor its members,
managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any
member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "Equityholders'
Representative Group"), will be responsible to the Equityholders for any loss
or damages it or they may suffer by reason of the performance by the
Equityholders' Representative of its duties under this Agreement, under the
Escrow Agreement or under the Equityholders' Representative Engagement
Agreement, other than loss or damage arising from fraud, bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct by the Equityholders' Representative.  \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If the Equityholders' Representative resigns or is
otherwise similarly unable to carry out its duties hereunder, then the
Equityholders with an aggregate Pro Rata Portion of at least 50.1% (the
"Requisite Equityholders") will, within five Business Days, appoint a new
Equityholders' Representative. The Requisite Equityholders may at any time,
for any reason or no reason, remove the Equityholders' Representative. If at
any time there is not a Equityholders' Representative and the Equityholders
fail to designate in writing a successor Equityholders' Representative within
twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of a written request delivered by
Parent to the Requisite Equityholders requesting that a successor
Equityholders' Representative be designated in writing, then Parent may
appoint a new Equityholders' Representative hereunder (who will not be
affiliated with Parent). The immunities and rights to indemnification of the
Equityholders' Representative Group shall survive the resignation or removal
of the Equityholders' Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and
the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) All actions, decisions and instructions of the
Equityholders' Representative taken, made or given pursuant to the authority
granted to the Equityholders' Representative pursuant to this Section 9.11
will be conclusive and binding upon each Equityholder and such Equityholder's
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such
Equityholder, and no Equityholder will have the right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same. Each Equityholder, by the execution and
delivery of any Stockholder Consent, Letter of Transmittal or Cancellation
Agreement, as applicable, will be deemed to have approved, confirmed and
ratified any action taken by the Equityholders' Representative in the exercise
of the power-of-attorney granted to the Equityholders' Representative pursuant
to this Section 9.11, which power-of-attorney, being coupled with an interest,
is irrevocable and will survive the death, incapacity or incompetence of each
such Equityholder.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The Equityholders' Representative Group will not be liable
to the Equityholders for any act done or omitted hereunder in its capacity as
the Equityholders' Representative unless caused by fraud, bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct by the Equityholders' Representative. The
Equityholders' Representative will not have any fiduciary, agency or other
duties to the Equityholders and its only obligations will be as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. The Equityholders' Representative is serving in that
capacity solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not
personally liable for any of the obligations of the Equityholders hereunder,
and Parent and the Company agree that they will not look to the underlying
assets of the Equityholders' Representative for the satisfaction of any
obligations of the Equityholders (or any of them). The Equityholders will
severally, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions (and not
jointly), indemnify and defend the Equityholders' Representative Group and
hold the Equityholders' Representative on demand harmless against any damages,
losses, claims, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses (including costs incurred
in connection with seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, the "Equityholders' Representative
Expenses") incurred by the Equityholders' Representative and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the
Equityholders' Representative duties hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or
under the Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel, accountants, auditors and
other professionals or advisors retained by the Equityholders' Representative,
in each case as such Equityholders' Representative Expenses are incurred,
which rights will survive the resignation or removal of the  \t\t

  \t\t\t65  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\tEquityholders' Representative, except to the extent caused by fraud,
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Equityholders'
Representative. The Equityholders' Representative will be entitled to retain
its own counsel and other professional advisers in connection with the
acceptance, performance or administration of the Equityholders'
Representative's duties hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the
Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement or the exercise of any of
the Equityholders' Representative's rights hereunder, under the Escrow
Agreement or under the Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement, and
will further be entitled to withdraw from the Representative Expense Amount
the amount of any Equityholders' Representative Expenses, and in the event
that the Representative Expense Amount has been fully depleted, the amount of
such Equityholders' Representative Expenses may be withdrawn from any amounts
otherwise distributable to the Equityholders, at the time of such distribution
(provided, that nothing in this Section 9.11(f) shall relieve the
Equityholders of their obligation to promptly pay such Equityholders'
Representative Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor prevent the
Equityholders' Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law
or otherwise). In the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder, the
Equityholders' Representative may, in its sole and reasonable discretion,
refrain from taking any action, unless the Equityholders' Representative
receives written instructions, signed by the Advisory Group (in accordance
with the terms of the Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement),
that eliminate such ambiguity or uncertainty. The Equityholders acknowledge
that the Equityholders' Representative shall not be required to expend or risk
its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. Furthermore, the Equityholders' Representative shall not be
required to take any action unless the Equityholders' Representative has been
provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are
sufficient to protect the Equityholders' Representative against the costs,
expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Equityholders'
Representative in performing such actions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) If the Equityholders' Representative elects to take any
other action under this Agreement that may require the payment of amounts out
of the Representative Expense Amount, including for any attorneys,
accountants, auditors or other advisors, the Equityholders' Representative may
refrain from taking any such action until such time as the Equityholders'
Representative, upon seven days' notice to the Advisory Group, receives
written commitments signed by the Advisory Group (in accordance with the terms
of the Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement) for payment of such
expenses, in which case all Equityholders will pay their Pro Rata Portion of
such estimated expenses. Any such initial notice by the Equityholders'
Representative to the Advisory Group will include a statement of the balance
of the Representative Expense Amount, the good faith estimate of the
reasonable expenses to be incurred by the Equityholders' Representative, the
amount by which the estimated expenses to be incurred exceed the balance of
the Representative Expense Amount, and each Equityholder's Pro Rata Portion of
such excess expense amount. Each Equityholder will deliver its Pro Rata
Portion of any excess expense amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, using the wire instructions identified in any such initial notice, no
later than ten days following the date on which the Equityholders'
Representative gives such Equityholder notice of the receipt of commitments
signed by the Advisory Group (in accordance with the terms of the
Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement) for payment of such excess
expenses; provided, however, that no Equityholder will be required to make
any payments, individually or  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t\tin the aggregate, pursuant to this Section 9.11(g) in excess of 95% of
the Merger Consideration previously received by such Equityholder. Any amounts
thus paid will increase the balance of the Representative Expense Amount.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) The Representative Expense Amount shall be held by the
Equityholders' Representative in a segregated client account and shall be used
(i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Equityholders'
Representative for any Equityholders' Representative Expenses incurred
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Equityholders'
Representative Engagement Agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the
Advisory Group. The Equityholders' Representative is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Representative
Expense Amount other than as a result of its fraud, bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Equityholders' Representative is not
acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with
the Representative Expense Amount, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Equityholders will not receive any interest on
the Representative Expense Amount and assign to the Equityholders'
Representative any such interest. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the
Equityholders' Representative may contribute funds to the Representative
Expense Amount from any consideration otherwise distributable to the
Equityholders. As soon as reasonably determined by the Equityholders'
Representative that the Representative Expense Amount is no longer required to
be withheld, the Equityholders' Representative shall distribute the remaining
Representative Expense Amount (if any) to the Paying Agent and/or Parent, as
applicable, for further distribution to the Equityholders. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) The Equityholders' Representative shall have reasonable
access to information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable
assistance of the Company's former officers and employees for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder; provided, however,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
provide such access or information if it determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that doing so would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client
privilege. The Equityholders' Representative shall take reasonable steps to
ensure that any information provided by the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Agreement is not disclosed to any competitor of
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Certain Equityholders (the "Advisory Group") will, on or
prior to the Closing, enter into an agreement (the "Equityholders'
Representative Engagement Agreement") with the Equityholders' Representative
regarding direction to be provided by the Advisory Group to the Equityholders'
Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Equityholders' Representative Engagement Agreement.
Upon written request from Parent, the Equityholders' Representative shall
provide to Parent the names of the Equityholders comprising the Advisory Group
as of such time; provided that the Advisory Group shall have no more than five
(5) members at any time without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Advisory Group shall incur no liability to the Equityholders for any liability
incurred by the members of the Advisory Group while acting in good faith and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of their
duties (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith), even if
such  \t\t

 \t\t\tact or omission constitutes negligence on the part of the Advisory
Group or one of its members. This indemnification and exculpation shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the
Equityholders' Representative and each member of the Advisory Group shall
enter into a customary confidentiality agreement with Parent, on terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "Representative NDA"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) The Equityholders' Representative shall be entitled to (i)
rely upon the Allocation Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it
to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Equityholder or other
party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.12 Privileged Information; Conflicts. If the
Equityholders' Representative so desires, acting on behalf of the
Equityholders and without the need for any consent or waiver by Company,
Parent, or Merger Sub, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and
Hachigian, LLP ("Gunderson") shall not be precluded by reason of its pre-
Closing representation of the Company from representing the Equityholders
after the Closing in connection with any matter, including anything related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements
referenced herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Gunderson shall
not be precluded by reason of its pre-Closing representation of the Company
from representing the Equityholders, any of their agents and Affiliates, or
any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction, or
dispute (including any litigation, arbitration, or other adversary proceeding)
with Parent, the Company, or any of their agents or Affiliates under or
relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other
agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with
respect to any indemnification claims. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company
further agree that, as to all communications among Gunderson and the
Equityholders' Representative and the Equityholders and their respective
Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "Seller Group") that relate in
any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-
client privilege and the exception of client confidence belongs solely to the
Seller Group and may be controlled only by the Seller Group and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Parent, Sub, and Company, because the interests of Parent
and its Affiliates were directly adverse to the Company, the Equityholders,
and the Equityholders' Representative at the time such communications were
made. This right to the attorney-client privilege shall exist even if such
communications may exist on the Company's computer system or in documents in
the Company's possession. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company, on the one hand,
and a Person other than a party to this Agreement, on the other hand, after
the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure to such third-party of confidential communications by Gunderson;
provided, however, that the Company may not waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Equityholders' Representative. \t\t

foregoing, the maximum total Milestone Payments payable by Parent to the
Equityholders shall not exceed $425,000,000.00 (the "Earn-out Amount"). The

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotice and Payment. No later than thirty (30) days after the

year following the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (the period
beginning on the Closing and ending on the earliest to occur of (i) and (ii),
collectively, the "Milestone Period"), Parent shall provide the Equityholders'
Representative with a true, correct and complete written report (in reasonable
detail) of its activity and progress toward achievement of the Milestone
Events (other than the Net Sales Milestone Event) during the previous calendar
year (collectively, the "Milestone Statements"). Parent shall, for the
immediately preceding six (6) year period (or, if longer, the maximum
retention period under the record retention policy of Parent for business or
audit records), keep complete and accurate data and records concerning the
activity and progress related to the research and development activities and
regulatory approvals development of a Milestone Product, including, as
applicable, the research and development activities and regulatory approvals,

products for which it intends to submit an application for Regulatory
Approval. \t\t

Parent shall keep complete and accurate data and records for a minimum period
of six (6) years (or, if longer, the maximum retention period under the record
retention policy of Parent for business or audit records) after the relevant
Net Sales occur, setting forth the sales of the TNT009 Products in sufficient
detail to enable Net Sales to be determined. All reports, materials and
information provided by a Milestone Party to the Equityholders' Representative
under this Exhibit D shall be subject to the Representative NDA. \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWithin thirty (30) days following receipt by the Equityholders'
Representative of each such report required by Section 3(a) or Section 3(b),
the Equityholders' Representative may request one meeting with representatives
of the Milestone Parties having detailed knowledge of such efforts, progress
and plans, for the purpose of providing the Equityholders' Representative with
an opportunity to inquire about the content of such report required by Section
3(a) or Section 3(b). If the Equityholders' Representative so requests a
meeting, the Equityholders' Representative and the appropriate representatives
of the Parent and/or the other Milestone Parties shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to, within sixty (60) calendar days following such request,
meet in person or by telephone conference or video conference as mutually

 \t\t\tMilestone Event Disputes.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf the Equityholders' Representative believes that any Milestone Event
has occurred and Parent has not reported its occurrence in accordance with
this Exhibit D, then the Equityholders' Representative shall deliver to Parent
written notice thereof (a "Milestone Dispute Notice"), in reasonable detail.
During the thirty (30) days following the delivery of a Milestone Dispute
Notice, Parent and the Equityholders' Representative shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any dispute as to whether any Milestone Event has occurred
and whether any Milestone Payment is payable. In the case of any Milestone
Dispute Notice that relates to any Milestone Event other than the Net Sales
Milestone Event, following such thirty-day period, either party may initiate
litigation of such dispute in accordance with Sections 9.7, 9.9 and 9.10 of
the Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the case of any Milestone Dispute Notice that relates to the Net
Sales Milestone Event, if Parent and the Equityholders' Representative do not
reach agreement with respect to all disputes relating to any such matter
within thirty (30) days after a Milestone Dispute Notice is delivered to
Parent by the Equityholders' Representative, the parties shall submit for
arbitration all matters that remain in dispute and that were properly included
in the Milestone Dispute Notice to an internationally recognized independent
public accounting firm that is not affiliated with either party and which
shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Equityholders' Representative in
writing (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). If Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative cannot agree on a  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tmutually acceptable Independent Accounting Firm within thirty (30)
days after either party has determined that the parties cannot reach agreement
with respect to a dispute, then within five (5) Business Days after the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period, each of Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative shall appoint one Independent Accounting Firm
who shall jointly select a third Independent Accounting Firm within five (5)
Business Days after the last to occur of their respective appointments to
arbitrate the referred matter. The Independent Accounting Firm mutually
agreed by the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, the third Independent
Accounting Firm selected by the party-appointed Independent Accounting Firms
is referred to as the "Selected Accounting Firm". Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative shall instruct the Selected Accounting Firm to
determine as promptly as practicable but in no event later than thirty (30)
days after such Person's appointment (the "Sales Determination Period")
whether the disputed Net Sales Milestone Event has occurred. The Selected
Accounting Firm's determination shall be made based on the submission of
documents and evidence by the parties (including any such documentation or
evidence requested by the Selected Accounting Firm, which the Equityholders'
Representative or Parent shall provide upon request) and, upon the Selected
Accounting Firm's request, by third parties unless the Selected Accounting
Firm determines that an oral hearing is necessary. The Selected Accounting
Firm shall determine deadlines (which Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative shall deem to be fair and appropriate) within the Sales
Determination Period for submitting documents and dates, if any, of oral
hearings. Each of Parent and the Equityholders' Representative (on behalf of
the Equityholders) shall pay its own expenses of arbitration, and the fees,
costs and expenses of the Selected Accounting Firm initially shall be equally
shared between Parent and the Equityholders' Representative (on behalf of the
Equityholders), provided that the prevailing party's expenses in such dispute
(including its share of the arbitration fees and costs, its attorneys' fees,
costs and expenses, and the fees, costs and expenses of the Selected
Accounting Firm) shall be reimbursed by the other party. Any decision
rendered by the Selected Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon the
parties. All proceedings conducted by the Selected Accounting Firm shall take
place in Boston, Massachusetts. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAny underpayments of Milestone Payments shall be paid by Parent within
thirty (30) days of notification of the final determination of the Milestone
Dispute Notice in accordance with this Exhibit D together with a late fee on
the outstanding amount calculated at the Prime Rate as published in the Wall
Street Journal, from the date the court or Independent Accounting Firm (as
applicable) determines such Milestone Payment was due, provided that in lieu
of accruing interest as set forth herein, Parent may deposit the disputed
Milestone Payment with a third party escrow agent in an interest bearing
account (at which point such interest shall cease to accrue), to be disbursed
by the holder of such funds to the prevailing party in such dispute. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSupport. From the Closing Date through the end of the Milestone
Period, Parent covenants and agrees that it will, itself and/or through
another Milestone Party, (i) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to achieve
the Milestone Events 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and (ii) not take any action, a
materially contributing intent of which is to avoid achievement of any
Milestone Event (excluding the extent to which the Parent takes into
consideration its obligation to make the Milestone Payments in connection with
satisfying its obligations pursuant to \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tsubclause (i) above). For clarity, Parent will still be obligated to
pay Milestone Payments upon achievement of Milestone Events that occur after
the end of the Milestone Period. In addition and without limiting the
foregoing, Parent covenants and agrees as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tMilestone Payments shall be paid regardless of whether the Milestone
Event was achieved by Parent, its Affiliate, or any of its licensees,
sublicensees, or transferees (including by way of a Product Line Sale), but,
with respect to the Net Sales Milestone Event, not distributors (unless such
distributors' sales are made to an end user consumer) (the "Milestone
Parties"). For clarity, Net Sales made by all Milestone Parties will be
considered in determining whether the Net Sales Milestone Event has occurred.
Regardless of the transfer, assumption, assignment, or license of rights to a
Milestone Party, Parent shall remain responsible for each Milestone Party's
performance under this Exhibit D, provided, however, that to the extent a
Capable Purchaser assumes Parent's obligations hereunder, Parent's obligations
pursuant to this Exhibit D shall terminate and become void. In the event of
any assumption of any obligations of Parent under the preceding sentence, such
Capable Purchaser shall (as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such
Product Line Sale for purposes of this Exhibit D) make an irrevocable offer to
enter into an agreement with the Equityholders' Representative pursuant to
which such Capable Purchaser agrees to be bound by the applicable provisions
of this Exhibit D (which agreement will be pre-executed by the Capable
Purchaser and only require the counter-signature of the Equityholders'
Representative to become legally binding upon the Capable Purchaser).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the event that any Acquisition Proposal involving Parent
(substituting references to "Parent" for references to "the Company" and
references to "50.1%" for references to "15%" in the definition thereof)
occurs during such period, and thereafter material assets are transferred out
of the Company to an Affiliate and/or the Company incurs material indebtedness
to an Affiliate (whether by operation of law or otherwise), Parent shall cause
(as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such transaction for
purposes of this Exhibit D) Parent's successor entity (which for clarity in
the case of a tender offer, "triangular" merger or similar transaction will be
deemed to be the ultimate parent entity following consummation of such
Acquisition Proposal) to assume or guarantee the obligations of Parent under
this Exhibit D in a manner that affords the Equityholders' Representative the
ability to enforce such assumed obligations or guarantee on behalf of the
Equityholders against such successor entity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Milestone Payments
are contingent upon satisfaction of the conditions provided for herein, which
may not be satisfied, and as a result, some or all of such payments may never
be paid, (ii) the obligations of the Parent in respect of the Milestone
Payments are only those expressly provided for in this Exhibit D, and no
implied duties shall apply, except for the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, (iii) the possibility of receiving the Milestone Payments in
accordance with the terms set forth in this Exhibit D constitute sufficient
consideration for entering into this Agreement, and (iv) no Milestone Party
has made any representations or warranties other than as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, and in determining to enter into this Agreement, the
Company has not relied on any statements or information from the Parent other
than the representations and warranties of Parent set  \t\t

 \t\t\tforth in this Agreement. The Company hereby waives, disclaims and
forever relinquishes any right to any claim in respect of a Milestone Payment
based on any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement other than those
expressly set forth in this Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tParent's obligations under clause (i) of the first paragraph of this
Section 5 shall terminate with respect to any period of time covered by a
report described in Section 3(a) of this Exhibit D following compliance by the
Parent with Section 3(a) (including the requirement to provide accurate
information therein), on the 120th day following the delivery of such report
(or, if a meeting or records inspection is requested pursuant to Section 3(d),
the 120th day following the holding of that meeting or delivery of such
records) unless prior to such date the Equityholders' Representative delivers
written notice to the Parent alleging a violation of this Section 5 with
respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Milestone Parties
during such period setting forth any actions allegedly taken in violation of
Section 5 and any actions allegedly omitted to having been taken in violation
of Section 5 and, if applicable, actions the Milestone Parties may thereafter
take to cure the alleged breach of Section 5. If the Equityholders'
Representative delivers such a notice, the Equityholders' Representative and
the Parent shall, in good faith, discuss such allegations and actions which
the Parent may take to cause the Equityholders' Representative to withdraw
such notice (contingent upon Milestone Parties taking agreed upon, specified
actions). Between the date of such notice and the 90th day following such
notice (concurrent with any discussions between the Equityholders'
Representative and the Parent), the Parent shall be entitled to take or commit
to take actions to redress the allegations contained in such notice.
Following such 90th day, if the Equityholders' Representative continues to
reasonably believe that the Parent has violated Section 5, taking into account
any curative actions taken or committed to be taken by the Parent during such
90-day period, the Equityholders' Representative may thereafter deliver
another notice to the Parent setting forth allegations of a violation of
Section 5, with respect to which the Equityholders' Representative shall
thereafter have the remedies available to it under this Agreement with respect
to any such breach. For clarity, nothing in this Section 5(d) will limit the
rights or remedies of the Equityholders' Representative (on behalf of the
Equityholders) with respect to any inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions in
such report, meeting or records referred to in the first sentence of this
Section 5(d). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tDisclaimer. For the avoidance of doubt, any right of an Equityholder
to receive any portion of the Milestone Payments (i) does not represent any
equity or ownership interest in the Surviving Corporation or Parent, and (ii)
does not confer upon the Equityholders any rights common to stockholders of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, including any voting or dividend
rights. \t\t

to be expended by Parent (whether directly or through the efforts of other
Milestone Parties), that level of effort that a similarly situated company
operating in the pharmaceutical industry would undertake where it was acting
in a diligent manner, taking into account the following relevant factors to
the extent applicable, including: stage of development, mechanism of action,

GAAP by the selling Milestone Party and demonstrable by written evidence: (a)
shipping, packing, and other transportation and insurance costs; (b)

shall be determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as consistently applied by
the applicable Milestone Party across all of their products. With respect to
excise tax payments pursuant to Section 9008 of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act of 2010 or any other similar payments in other countries,

 \t\t\t"Milestone Products" means the TNT009 Product and the TNT020
Product. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Net Sales" means the gross amount invoiced for sale or other
disposition of the TNT009 Product by all Milestone Parties, minus the
Exclusions. Net Sales shall be calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSales or other dispositions of a Product by a Milestone Party to its
Affiliate or licensee shall be excluded from the computation of Net Sales
unless such Affiliate or licensee is an end user consumer of the TNT009
Product. For purposes of calculating Net Sales, sales in any currency other
than U.S. dollars shall be converted to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate
conversion convention applied by the applicable Milestone Party in its
standard financial reporting practices and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the event that consideration in addition to or in lieu of currency
is received for the sale of the TNT009 Product in an arms-length transaction,

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSales for such sale shall be the average Net Sales of such TNT009
Product sold in an arms-length transaction during the applicable reporting
period in the country in which the non-arms-length transaction occurred. If
there are no arms-length transactions available as a reference under the
preceding sentence, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a mechanism
for calculating Net Sales on the non-arms-length transaction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor purposes of this Agreement, "sale" shall mean any transfer or
other disposition, but shall not include transfers or other distributions or
dispositions of the TNT009 Product at no charge (i) for academic research,
preclinical, clinical, or regulatory purposes or (ii) in connection with
patient assistance programs, named patient programs, or other compassionate
use or charitable purposes or (iii) to physicians or hospitals for promotional
purposes (including free samples to a level and in an amount which is
customary in the industry and/or which is reasonably proportional to the
market for such Product). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the event that the TNT009 Product is sold by a Milestone Party in
combination with another product that contains an active ingredient, Net Sales
for such combination product shall be determined by multiplying actual Net
Sales of the combination product during the payment period by the fraction
A/(A+B) where A is the average sale price of such TNT009 Product when sold
separately and B is the average sales price of the other active ingredient
(or, if the case be so, the sum of the average sales prices of all other
active ingredients) when sold separately in each case during the applicable
reporting period in the country in which the sale of the combination product
was made, or if sales of both the TNT009 Product and the other active
ingredient(s) did not occur in such country in such period, then in the most
recent reporting period in which sales of both occurred. In the event that
such average sale price cannot be determined for both the TNT009 Product and
all other active ingredients included in the combination product, Net Sales
for purposes of determining payments under this Agreement shall be calculated
by multiplying the Net Sales of the combination product by the fraction
C/(C+D) where C is the fair market value (as reasonably agreed by Parent and
the Equityholders' Representative in good faith) of the Product portion of the
combination, and D is the fair market value (as reasonably agreed by Parent
and the Equityholders' Representative in good faith) of the other active
ingredient portion of the combination product. \t\t
