of each of Parent and Merger Sub deem it in the best interests of their respective stockholders, as

and apart from its other funds, as a trust fund, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration and Option Payments (such deposited cash being hereinafter referred to as the

Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant
to Section&nbsp;2.01(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required as a result of such payment or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section&nbsp;2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such
Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>No Further Rights</U>. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates

undistributed to the holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;<U>No Liability</U>. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash (including any dividends or
distributions with respect to such Shares) delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options, such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax Laws. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

terminated (in each case, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Option
Plans and without the creation of additional liability to the Company or any Subsidiaries).

Agent, in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash (subject to
any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the difference between the Merger
Consideration and the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option, and (ii)&nbsp;the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible
in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

warranties relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions,
(b)&nbsp;no person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or warranty relating to
itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions and, if made, such
representation or warranty must not be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c)
any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or
any other materials or information provided or addressed to any party or any of its Representatives
are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations or warranties unless any such
materials or information is the subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement.

Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law
or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights and
obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent,
