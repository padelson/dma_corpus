 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock (each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as a " _Share_ " and collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b), Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $6.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable    ##### Table of Contents

  

  

upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.02, of the certificate
that formerly evidenced such Share.   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.   

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   

 SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into an exchange agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and Option Payments in accordance with this Article II. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares and Company Stock Options, separate and apart from its other funds, as a trust fund, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and Option Payments (such deposited cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Exchange Fund shall not be invested in any manner that would preclude, limit or delay the Paying Agent from timely making all payments contemplated by this Article II; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, if invested, such investments shall be in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations guaranteed by, the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who, at the Effective Time, was a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (in customary form, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other    ##### Table of Contents

  

  

documents as reasonably may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to Section
2.01(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II.   

 (c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as provided herein or by Law.   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash (including any dividends or distributions with respect to such Shares) delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such    ##### Table of Contents

  

  

Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable and
customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).   

 SECTION 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. At or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).   

 SECTION 2.04 _Company Stock Options_. (a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action (which action shall be effective as of the Effective Time), including obtaining the consent of the individual option holders and the adoption of Company Board resolutions, if necessary, to ensure that (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under any of the stock option plans of the Company as amended through the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full, (ii) at the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Option Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding, unexercised and not subject to payment under Section 2.04(b) as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled, and (iii) at the Effective Time, all of the Company Stock Option Plans shall be terminated (in each case, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and without the creation of additional liability to the Company or any Subsidiaries).   

 (b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time and has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is less than the Merger Consideration shall (subject to the provisions of this Section 2.04) be paid by the Paying Agent, in exchange for the cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (i) the difference between the Merger Consideration and the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Payments_ "). The Paying Agent shall make the Option Payments as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. Any such payments shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding requirements.   

 SECTION 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_.   

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the    ##### Table of Contents

  

  

Effective Time and that are held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand
and properly demands the appraisal for such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") pursuant to, and in compliance in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Any
such stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all Dissenting
Shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who
otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholders rights to appraisal
of such Shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.02 of
the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that it is required to do so under applicable Law;    ##### Table of Contents

any committee thereof) shall (i) recommend that the stockholders of the

 SECTION 6.04 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director,

expenses if it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification) and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without the Surviving Corporations written consent (which consent

neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to
this Section 6.04(b) to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel

except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have
conflicting interests in the outcome of such action.

 SECTION 9.04 _Severability_.
