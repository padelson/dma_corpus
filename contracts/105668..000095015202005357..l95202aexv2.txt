2.4 EFFECT OF MERGER.   At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger

and franchises shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
Surviving Corporation\'s debts, liabilities, and duties.      12   
2.5 CHARTER AND BYLAWS.   At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at
and as of the Effective Time to read as did the Articles of Incorporation of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of
the Surviving Corporation shall remain unchanged) until thereafter amended.
The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall continue to be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time until thereafter amended.   2.6 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.  
Merger Sub\'s director(s) and officers immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Surviving Corporation\'s initial director(s)
and officers.   2.7 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK.   At the Effective Time,
because of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, or the Company:   (a) COMMON STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of Merger
Sub\'s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully
paid, and non-assessable share of the Surviving Corporation\'s common stock.
Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares
shall from and after the Effective Time evidence ownership of shares of the
Surviving Corporation\'s common stock.   (b) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON
STOCK. Subject to SECTION 2.12, each Company Common Share shall be converted
into the right to receive such amount of cash that results from dividing (A)
$275,000,000, less the amounts payable by Parent to the Persons identified on
SCHEDULE 2.3(E), as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 2.14 (the "AGGREGATE MERGER
CONSIDERATION") by (B) the number of Company Common Stock Equivalents
outstanding as of the Effective Time (the "PER SHARE MERGER CONSIDERATION").
Each such Company Common Share, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and the holder of a certificate (a "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATE")
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented the outstanding
Company Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the pro rata portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreements.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this SECTION 2.7, the Aggregate Merger
Consideration shall be subject to reduction for the aggregate amount paid
pursuant to the indemnification provisions of ARTICLE 8.   (c) RIGHTS PRIOR
TO SURRENDER, STOCK SPLITS, ETC. AND STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. Until surrendered
as contemplated by SECTION 2.8, each Company Stock Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration for each
Company Common Share represented by such Company Stock Certificate. If
between the date hereof and the Effective Time the outstanding Company Shares
are changed into a different number of shares or a different class, because
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination,        13   or exchange of shares, the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, or exchange of shares. After the Effective Time, the Company\'s
stock transfer books shall be closed and there shall be no further transfers
of Company Shares. If, at or after the Effective Time, Company Stock
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged in accordance with this Agreement.   2.8 SURRENDER
OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. At the Closing, (i) the holders
of Company Stock Certificates shall surrender such certificates to Parent,
(ii) assuming surrender of the Company Stock Certificate the holder thereof
shall receive the applicable portion of the Initial Merger Consideration less
the applicable portion of the Escrow Amount and the Holdback Amount, and
(iii) the Company Stock Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled.   (b) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY SHARES. All portions
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares.   (c)
LOST, STOLEN, OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. If any Company Stock Certificate has
been lost, stolen, or destroyed, Parent shall issue the applicable portion of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof upon (i)
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and (ii) if the
Surviving Corporation reasonably requires, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate.   2.9
STOCK OPTIONS.   (a) PURCHASE OF OPTIONS. At the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
Company Option shall remain outstanding after the Effective Time as an option
to purchase Company common stock upon the same terms and conditions as such
outstanding Company Options. On the first business day following the Closing
Date, Parent shall purchase each Company Option for an amount (the "OPTION
CONSIDERATION") equal to the result obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share
Merger Consideration by (B) the number of shares of common stock of the
Company issuable upon exercise of such Company Option after giving effect to
acceleration of vesting, and then subtracting the applicable exercise price
under such Company Option. On the first business day following the Closing
Date, Parent shall pay to the holder of each Company Option that portion of
the Option Consideration constituting such holder\'s pro rata portion of the
Option Consideration, less such holder\'s portion of the Holdback Amount and
Escrow Amount. Additionally, the Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from each holder\'s applicable portion of the Option Consideration
such amount that the Company is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. The Company shall promptly pay or
cause to be paid any amounts that are withheld to the appropriate
Governmental Bodies on behalf of the holders of Company Options.
The holder\'s pro rata portion of the       14   Holdback Amount and
the Escrow Amount shall be released to such holder at the same time, if ever,
as the corresponding amounts are released to the Shareholders.   (b)
AMENDMENTS TO PLANS. Such amendments to each Company stock option plan and
Company Option as may be required to reflect the Merger and the terms of this
SECTION 2.9 shall be deemed to have been made at the Effective Time.   2.10
WARRANTS.   The Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause
each of the Company Warrants to be exercised in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time. After the Effective Time, the holders of any Company Warrants
which were not so exercised shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of
the certificate evidencing such Company Warrants, cash in an amount (the
"WARRANT CONSIDERATION") equal to the result obtained by multiplying (A) the
Per Share Merger Consideration by (B) the number of shares of common stock of
the Company issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant, and then
subtracting the applicable exercise price under such Company Warrant. The
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from each holder\'s
applicable portion of the Warrant Consideration such amount that the Company
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations. The Company shall promptly pay or cause to be paid any amounts
that are withheld to the appropriate Governmental Bodies on behalf of the
holders of Company Warrants. The Company shall also withhold that portion of
the Warrant Consideration constituting the holder\'s pro rata portion of the
Holdback Amount and the Escrow Amount and such amounts shall be released to
the holders of Company Warrants at the same time, if ever, as such amounts
are released to the Shareholders.   2.11 TAX TREATMENT.   The Parties
intend that the Merger constitute a taxable stock purchase and sale for
federal and state income tax purposes.   2.12 SHARES OF DISSENTING
SHAREHOLDERS.   Any Company Shares a Shareholder properly exercising its
dissent or appraisal rights under the Corporate Law (a "DISSENTING
SHAREHOLDER") holds shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder
under the Corporate Law; except that each Company Share outstanding at the
Effective Time that a Dissenting Shareholder holds for which, after the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws its demand to exercise
dissenters or appraisal rights or loses its right to exercise dissenters or
appraisal rights as provided in the Corporate Law, shall be deemed to be
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any
written demands for the exercise of dissenters or appraisal rights,
withdrawals of demands for the exercise of dissenters or appraisal rights and
any other instruments served under the Corporate Law, and (b) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
exercise of dissenters or appraisal rights under the Corporate Law. The
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment       15   with
respect to any purchase demands and shall not, except with Parent\'s
prior written consent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.   2.13
TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION.   If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title, and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers, and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the
officers and directors of the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub are
fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to
take, and the Company and Parent shall cause them to take, all such lawful
and necessary action.   2.14 HOLDBACK AMOUNT; ADJUSTMENT TO AGGREGATE
MERGER CONSIDERATION.   The Aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by
SECTION 2.7(b) (without giving effect to any adjustments pursuant to this
SECTION 2.14, the "INITIAL MERGER CONSIDERATION") shall be adjusted as
follows:   (a) ADJUSTMENTS TO INITIAL MERGER CONSIDERATION. The Initial
Merger Consideration shall be subject to the following adjustments (the
"INITIAL MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENTS") set forth below:   (i) COMPANY
CASH BALANCE. The Initial Merger Consideration (x)  shall be increased or
decreased by the amount that the Company\'s cash  and cash equivalents (other
than cash withheld to comply with SECTION  4.12(b)) at the Closing Date
exceeds or is less than an amount equal to  $2,000 multiplied by the number
of Company-owned restaurants open at  the Closing Date, and (y) shall be
decreased by an amount equal to the  cash required to be withheld (but not
withheld) to comply with SECTION  4.12(b).   (ii) WORKING CAPITAL. The
Initial Merger Consideration shall  be increased or decreased by the amount
by which the Working Capital as  of the Closing Date is greater than or less
than a deficit of  $4,000,000.   (iii) OPTION AND WARRANT EXERCISE PRICES.
The Initial Merger  Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to
the sum of the  exercise prices of all of the Company Options and the Company
Warrants  outstanding at the Closing Date after giving effect to acceleration
of  vesting (which sum shall be computed as (i) the product of the number 
of shares of common stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of the 
Company Options multiplied by the per share option exercise price, plus  (ii)
the product of the number of shares of common stock of the Company  issuable
upon exercise of the Company Warrants multiplied by the per  share warrant
exercise price, in all respects under clauses (i) and  (ii) on a case-by-case
basis).   (iv) SHAREHOLDER NOTES RECEIVABLE. The Initial Merger 
Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the sum of the 
amounts due and payable as of the Closing Date, as described on  SCHEDULE
5.9.     16    (v) COMPANY INDEBTEDNESS. The Initial Merger
Consideration  shall be reduced by the amount of any Company Indebtedness
existing as  of the Closing Date.   (vi) DIRECTED PAYMENTS. The Initial
Merger Consideration shall  be reduced by the amount of all Directed Payments
not paid in full by  the Company on or prior to the Closing Date, to the
extent of the  unpaid amounts.   (vii) NEW COMPANY RESTAURANTS. The Initial
Merger  Consideration shall be increased by the sum of (i) $4,550,000, 
representing the aggregate purchase price the Company paid pursuant to  an
Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 26, 2002, plus (ii) an  amount equal
to the aggregate increase in the Company\'s gross property  and equipment
from the date of the Audited Financial Statements to the  Closing Date,
computed in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that  in no event shall
the total increase pursuant to this SECTION  2.14(a)(vii) exceed
$9,500,000.   (b) CLOSING DATE ADJUSTMENT. Five calendar days prior to the
expected Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written
statement in the form of SCHEDULE 2.14(b) setting forth its good faith
estimate of the Initial Merger Consideration Adjustments as of the Closing
Date (on a net basis, the "HOLDBACK AMOUNT"). If the Holdback Amount is a
positive number reflecting an amount payable to the Security Holders, Parent
shall deposit such amount into an escrow account (the "HOLDBACK ESCROW
ACCOUNT"), which the Holdback Escrow Agreement shall govern. If the Holdback
Amount is a deficit in excess of $1,000,000, the Company shall have a right
to terminate this Agreement as set forth in SECTION 7.1(e) unless Parent
agrees in writing that the Holdback Amount shall equal a deficit of
$1,000,000. If (a) the Holdback Amount is a deficit of $1,000,000 or less, or
(b) if the Holdback Amount is a deficit in excess of $1,000,000, Parent does
not agree in writing that the Holdback Amount shall equal a deficit of
$1,000,000, and the Company does not terminate this Agreement, then the
amount of Initial Merger Consideration paid to the Security Holders on the
Closing Date shall be decreased by the Holdback Amount and such amount shall
be deposited into the Holdback Escrow Account.   (c) DEFINITIVE MERGER
CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT.   (i) CALCULATION. As promptly as practicable
after the Closing  Date, but not later than 30 calendar days thereafter,
Parent shall  deliver to Sellers\' Representative a schedule in the form of
SCHEDULE  2.14(b) setting forth in reasonable detail Parent\'s calculation of
the  Initial Merger Consideration Adjustments as of the Closing Date based 
on actual results (the "POST-CLOSING ESTIMATED ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT").  Unless
the Post-Closing Estimated Adjustment Amount varies from the  Holdback Amount
by $500,000 or more, either upwards or downwards, the  Holdback Amount shall
be final and binding on the Parties for all  purposes of this Agreement, and
shall be disbursed to the parties  entitled to receive the same no later than
the second business day  following Parent\'s delivery of the schedule
reflecting the Post-Closing  Estimated Adjustment Amount.      17   
(ii) REVIEW; DISPUTES. If the difference between the  Holdback Amount and the
Post-Closing Estimated Adjustment  Amount is greater than $500,000, Parent
must submit a letter  to Sellers\' Representative, at the same time that
Parent  submits the Post-Closing Estimated Adjustment Amount,  detailing
Parent\'s differences to the Company\'s calculation of  the Holdback Amount.
(To the extent that any portion of the  Holdback Amount is not in dispute,
such amount shall be  disbursed to the parties entitled to receive the same
no later  than the second business day following Parent\'s delivery of  the
schedule reflecting the Post-Closing Estimated Adjustment  Amount.) Upon
receipt thereof, Sellers\' Representative and  Parent shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to reach  agreement on the calculation of the Post-Closing
Estimated  Adjustment Amount. For these purposes, Sellers\' Representative 
shall have the right to communicate with, and to review the  work papers,
schedules, memoranda, and other documents that  Parent prepared or reviewed
in determining the Post-Closing  Estimated Adjustment Amount and concurrently
shall have access  to all books and records to the extent Sellers\'
Representative  reasonably requires them to complete its review of
Parent\'s  calculation of the Post-Closing Estimated Adjustment Amount.  If
Sellers\' Representative and Parent are unable to reach  agreement within 30
days after the date Sellers\'  Representative received Parent\'s calculation
of the  Post-Closing Estimated Adjustment Amount, either Party shall  have
the right to refer such matter to the Neutral Accounting  Firm on or prior to
such 30th day. The Neutral Accounting Firm  shall determine the actual Post-
Closing Estimated Adjustment  Amount within 30 days of such referral, and
such determination  shall be final and binding on Parent and the Security
Holders  for all purposes of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of  the
Neutral Accounting Firm shall be paid by Parent if the  Neutral Accounting
Firm determines that the difference between  the Holdback Amount and the
Post-Closing Estimated Adjusted  Amount is less than $500,000, and shall be
paid out of the  General Indemnity Escrow Account if the difference is more 
than $500,000. The amount determined in accordance with  SECTION 2.14(c)(i)
or SECTION 2.14(c)(ii), as applicable, is  the "CONCLUSIVE ADJUSTMENT
AMOUNT."   (iii) ADJUSTMENT TO HOLDBACK AMOUNT. If the  Conclusive
Adjustment Amount is a positive number reflecting a  payment due to the
Security Holders, an amount equal to the  Conclusive Adjustment Amount,
together with interest accrued  thereon, shall be released from the Holdback
Escrow Account  (and, if the Holdback Amount is insufficient, the Company 
shall promptly contribute additional amounts so that the full  Conclusive
Adjustment Amount is available for distribution)  and paid to the Security
Holders on a pro rata basis as  determined by solving for "A" under the
following formula:       18    X   A = -----   Y   Where   X
= the number of Company Common Stock Equivalents such  Security Holder held
as of the Effective Time.   Y = the number of Company Common Stock
Equivalents  outstanding as of the Effective Time.   If the Conclusive
Adjustment Amount is less than the Holdback Amount initially deposited by the
Company into the Holdback Escrow Account, the remaining balance of the
Holdback Amount (after payment of the Conclusive Adjustment Amount), together
with accrued interest thereon, shall be released to the Company. If the
Conclusive Adjustment Amount is a deficit reflecting a payment due to the
Company, an amount equal to the Conclusive Adjustment Amount, together with
interest accrued thereon, shall be released from the Holdback Escrow Account
(and, if the Holdback Amount is insufficient, such additional amount shall be
paid out of the General Indemnity Escrow Account) and paid to the Company. If
the Conclusive Adjustment Amount is less than the Holdback Amount initially
deposited into the Holdback Escrow Account out of the Initial Merger
Consideration, the remaining balance of the Holdback Amount (after payment of
the Conclusive Adjustment Amount), together with accrued interest thereon,
shall be released to the Security Holders on a pro rata basis as determined
in accordance with the formula set forth above. All amounts shall be released
from the Holdback Escrow Account in accordance with the Holdback
Escrow Agreement no later than the second business day following
determination of the Conclusive Adjustment Amount.   2.15 CLOSING

which shall detail the flow of funds on the Closing Date and track all
sources and uses of cash from the Parties pursuant to this Agreement.

Acquired Entity has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owed to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, holder of its Equity Interests, or other
third party.   (c) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.12(c), to the
Company\'s Knowledge there is no threatened assessment of any additional

None of the Acquired Entities (including the Company) has any net operating
loss, net capital loss, unused investment or other credit carryovers for
federal income Tax purposes, as of December 31, 2001.   (k) The unpaid
Taxes of the Acquired Entities (i) did not, as of the Balance Sheet Date,
exceed the reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
set forth in the Interim Financial Statements and (ii) do not exceed that
reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of the Acquired Entities

attributable to any one of the following:   (a) Any Breach of any
representation or warranty any Acquired Entity has made in this Agreement as
if such representation or warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date
after giving effect to any supplement to the Schedules, other than (in the
event the Transactions are consummated) any such Breach that is disclosed in
a supplement to the Schedules delivered under SECTION 5.6, as having caused a
condition specified in SECTION 6.1 not to be satisfied.   (b) Any Breach by
any Acquired Entity of any covenant or obligation of such Acquired Entity in
this Agreement.      46    8.3 INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS FOR THE
SECURITY HOLDERS\' BENEFIT.   Parent shall indemnify and hold the
Shareholder Indemnified Parties harmless from and pay any and all Damages
directly or indirectly resulting from, relating to, arising out of, or
attributable to any of the following:   (a) Any Breach of any representation
or warranty either Parent Party has made in this Agreement as if such
representation or warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date after
giving effect to any supplement to the Schedules, other than (in the event
the Transactions are consummated) any such Breach that is disclosed in a
supplement to the Schedules delivered under SECTION 5.6, as having caused a
condition specified in SECTION 6.2 not to be satisfied.   (b) Any Breach by
either Parent Party of any covenant or obligation of either Parent Party in
this Agreement.   8.4 INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM PROCEDURES.   (a) If any
Action is commenced in which any Indemnified Party is a party that may give
rise to a claim for indemnification against any Indemnitor under SECTIONS 8.2
or 8.3 (an "INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM"), then such Indemnified Party shall
promptly give notice to the Indemnitor. The failure to give such notice shall
not affect whether an Indemnitor is liable for reimbursement hereunder unless
such failure has resulted in the loss of material substantive rights with
respect to the Indemnitor\'s ability to defend such Indemnification claim.
The Indemnitor may contest and defend such Indemnification Claim so long as
the Indemnitor: (i) has a reasonable basis for concluding that such
defense may be successful, (ii) diligently contests and defends such
Indemnification Claim, and (iii) acknowledges in writing that it is obligated
to provide indemnification with respect to such Indemnification Claim. Notice
of the intention to so contest and defend shall be given by the Indemnitor to
the Indemnified Party within 20 business days after the Indemnified Party\'s
notice of such Indemnification Claim (but, in all events, at least 30
business days prior to the date that an answer to such Indemnification Claim
is due to be filed). Such contest and defense shall be conducted by reputable
attorneys employed by the Indemnitor and approved by the Indemnified Party
(which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The
Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own cost and expense (which
expense shall not constitute Damages unless the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that the Indemnitor is not adequately representing or, because of
a conflict of interest, may not adequately represent, the interests of the
Indemnified Parties, and has provided the Indemnitor with notice of such
determination, and then only to the extent that such expenses are
reasonable), to participate in such contest and defense and to be represented
by attorneys of its or their own choosing. If the Indemnified Party elects to
participate in such defense, the Indemnified Party will cooperate with the
Indemnitor in the conduct of such defense. Neither the Indemnified Party nor
the Indemnitor may concede, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim
without the consent of the other party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed in light of all factors of importance
to such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnitor fails
to acknowledge in writing its obligation to provide indemnification in
respect of such Indemnification Claim, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or to diligently
contest and defend such Indemnification Claim, then the      
47   Indemnified Party alone shall be entitled to contest, defend and
settle such Indemnification Claim in the first instance (in which case, all
expenses incurred in connection therewith shall constitute Damages) and, only
if the Indemnified Party chooses not to contest, defend or settle such
Indemnification Claim, the Indemnitor shall then have the right to contest
and defend (but not settle) such Indemnification Claim.   (b) In the event
any Indemnified Party shall have a claim against any Indemnitor that does not
involve an Indemnification Claim (i.e., a direct claim), the Indemnified
Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnitor. The failure to give such notice shall not affect whether an
Indemnitor is liable for reimbursement unless such failure has resulted in
the loss of substantive rights with respect to the Indemnitor\'s ability to
defend such claim, and then only to the extent of such loss. If
the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the
claim described in such notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party
within 30 days after delivery of such notice by the Indemnified Party whether
the Indemnitor disputes the claim described in such notice, the Damages in
the amount specified in the Indemnified Party\'s notice will be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall pay the amount
of such Damages to the Indemnified Party on demand. The foregoing obligations
shall be satisfied by the release of funds from the General Indemnity Escrow
Account in the case of an Indemnification Claim against the Security
Holders.   (c) Each party hereby consents to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of any Governmental Body, arbitrator, or mediator in which an
Action is brought against any Indemnified Party for purposes of any
Indemnification Claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement
with respect to such Action or the matters alleged therein.   8.5
LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY.    (a) WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS BY
PARENT INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. Any claims the Parent Indemnified Parties make
for indemnification under SECTION 8.2 shall be limited as follows:   (i)
CEILING. The Security Holders\' aggregate  Liability for money Damages under
this Agreement related to  Breaches of the representations, warranties, and
covenants  herein shall not exceed $4,000,000, provided that the  limitation

INDEMNIFIED  PARTIES THRESHOLD AMOUNT"); provided, however, that once such 
amount exceeds the Parent Indemnified Parties Threshold  Amount, the Parent
Indemnified Parties will be entitled to  recover all Damages in excess of
$250,000.      48    (b) WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS BY SHAREHOLDER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. Any claims the Shareholder Indemnified Parties make for
indemnification under SECTION 8.3 shall be limited as follows:   (i)
CEILING. The Parent Parties\' aggregate Liability  for money Damages under
this Agreement related to Breaches of  the representations and warranties
herein shall not exceed the  General Indemnity Escrow Amount, provided that

(ii) BASKET/THRESHOLD. The Parent Parties shall have  no Liability for money
Damages related to Breaches of the  representations and warranties in ARTICLE

Indemnified Parties Threshold Amount,  the Shareholder Indemnified Parties
will be entitled to  recover Damages in excess of $250,000.   (c) WITH
RESPECT TO CLAIMS BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. Any claims any Indemnified Party
makes under this ARTICLE 8 will be limited as follows:   (i) REDUCTION FOR
INSURANCE CLAIMS. The amount  required to be paid for Damages will be reduced
to the extent  of any amounts an Indemnified Party actually receives
pursuant  to the terms of the insurance policies (if any) covering such 
Indemnification Claim.   (ii) TAXES. In determining the amount of Damages 
payable, the Parties will take into account any Tax benefit to  an
Indemnified Party and the calculation of Damages shall be  computed on an
after Tax basis.   8.6 ESCROW.   (a) At Closing, $4,000,000 (the "GENERAL
INDEMNITY ESCROW AMOUNT") shall be placed in an escrow account (the "GENERAL
INDEMNITY ESCROW ACCOUNT"), which the Indemnity Escrow Agreement shall govern
with respect to indemnification claims made pursuant to SECTION 8.2, and
$4,000,000 (the "SPECIAL INDEMNITY ESCROW AMOUNT") shall be placed in an
escrow account (the "SPECIAL INDEMNITY ESCROW ACCOUNT"), which the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement shall govern with respect to indemnification claims made
pursuant to SECTION 8.10.   (b) A Parent Indemnified Party may not receive
any assets from the General Indemnity Escrow Account unless and until the
procedures set forth in SECTION 8.4 and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement have
been complied with. The remaining balance in the General Indemnity Escrow
Account that is not the subject of a bona fide dispute on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, shall be released to the Security
Holders.   (c) A Parent Indemnified Party may not receive any assets from
the Special Indemnity Escrow Account unless and until the procedures set
forth in SECTION 8.10 and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement have been complied
with. The remaining balance in the Special    49   Indemnity Escrow
Account that is not the subject of a bona fide dispute with respect to Tax
matters on the date which is eighteen months after the Closing Date, shall be
released to the Security Holders.   8.7 SOPHISTICATION OF PARENT.   Parent
represents and warrants that: (i) it has such knowledge and experience in
financial, tax and business matters as to enable it to utilize the due
diligence information made available to it in investigating the
Transaction, to evaluate the merit and risks of the Transactions and to make
an informed decision with respect thereto; and (ii) it has received the S-1
and all other materials requested by Parent in the course of its due
diligence investigation, has carefully reviewed them and understands the
information contained therein and in particular has carefully read and
considered the matters set forth under the caption "Risk Factors" in the S-1.
Prior to the Closing Date, if Parent becomes aware of any fact, circumstance
or event which would cause a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of the Company or any Shareholder to be in Breach, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company and, if applicable, the Shareholder, of the same and allow
the Company to amend the Schedules to reflect the same.   8.8 OTHER
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS.   Any Liability of the Acquired Entities to any
Shareholder Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall terminate for all
purposes upon Closing and have no further force or effect.   8.9 EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY.   From and after the Effective Time, the right to proceed against
an Indemnitor for any claim under ARTICLE 8 shall be the sole and
exclusive post-Closing remedy (except in the case of fraud) available under
contract, tort or any other legal theory, to any Indemnified Party (i) for
Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, (ii) with
respect to Special Indemnity Items by or on behalf of any Indemnitor, or
(iii) otherwise arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, and no Indemnified Party shall have the right to bring any
other action or otherwise pursue any other remedy whatsoever. Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to limit any recovery available to any Party
for any failure of any other Party to consummate the Merger in accordance
with the terms hereof.   8.10 ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) Each
Security Holder shall severally indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for
any Damages incurred by any Acquired Entity in connection with (i) the
disputes set forth on SCHEDULE 8.10(a) of this Agreement (the "DISPUTES"),
(ii) any Tax Liability relating to state income tax payable to states in
which any Acquired Entity has franchisees but does not pay such tax, any Tax
Liability relating to use tax payable to states in which the
Acquired Entities do not pay such tax, payroll tax payable with respect to
independent contractors of any Acquired Entity, and/or escheat or unclaimed
property reporting (a "SPECIAL TAX CLAIM"), and (iii) the Company\'s
inability to collect consistent data records for meal and break periods for
non-exempt positions (the "FLSA CLAIM" and, collectively with the Disputes
and the Special Tax Claim, the "SPECIAL INDEMNITY ITEMS"). The Security
Holders\' indemnification obligations under this SECTION 8.10 shall survive
for a period of eighteen months after the Closing Date, and the   
50   Security Holders\' aggregate Liability for indemnification under this
SECTION 8.10 shall not exceed $4,000,000.   (b) The Company shall continue
to contest and defend the Disputes. Such contest and defense shall be
conducted by reputable attorneys employed by the Company and approved by the
Sellers\' Representative (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Sellers\' Representative shall be deemed to have approved counsel
currently engaged by the Company in connection with the Disputes and such
counsel shall not be changed without good reason. The Company may not
concede, settle or compromise the Disputes without the consent of
the Sellers\' Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed in light of all factors of importance to such party.   (c) If
the Company shall have a claim against the Security Holders with respect to a
FLSA Claim or a Special Tax Claim, the Company shall deliver notice of such
claim with reasonable promptness to the Sellers\' Representative. The failure
to give such notice shall not affect whether the Security Holders are liable
for reimbursement unless such failure has resulted in the loss of substantive
rights with respect to the Sellers\' Representative\'s ability to defend such
claim, and then only to the extent of such loss. If the
Sellers\' Representative notifies the Company that it does not dispute the
claim described in such notice or fails to notify the Company within 30 days
after delivery of such notice by the Company whether the Sellers\'
Representative disputes the claim described in such notice, the Damages in
the amount specified in the Company\'s notice will be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Security Holders and the amount of Damages shall be released
to the Company from the Special Indemnity Account in accordance with the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement.   ARTICLE 9.  SELLERS\' REPRESENTATIVE

Representative, the other Shareholders and Parent. Any successor Sellers\'
Representative shall have all of the authority and responsibilities conferred
upon or delegated to a Sellers\' Representative pursuant to this ARTICLE
9.   9.4 RELIANCE; LIMITATION AS TO PARENT AND ACQUIRED ENTITIES.   (a)
Parent and the Acquired Entities may conclusively and absolutely rely,
without inquiry, and until the receipt of written notice of a change of the
Sellers\' Representative under SECTION 9.3, may continue to rely, without
inquiry, upon the action of the Sellers\' Representative as the action
of each Shareholder in all matters referred to in this ARTICLE 9;
provided, however, that if Parent is given written notice of the appointment
of a successor Sellers\' Representative under SECTION 9.3, Parent, the
Acquired Entities, and the Shareholders shall be obligated to recognize, and
shall be able to so rely only upon the action of, such successor Sellers\'
Representative as the Sellers\' Representative for all purposes under this
Agreement.   (b) Except as set forth in this SECTION 9.4, this ARTICLE
9 creates no binding obligations between Parent or the Acquired Entities, on
the one hand, and the Shareholders, on the other hand.   ARTICLE 10. 
MISCELLANEOUS   10.1 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TAX MATTERS POST-CLOSING.   The
following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between
the Parent Parties, the Company, and the Sellers\' Representative for certain
tax matters following the Closing Date:    (a) TAXABLE PERIODS AND
ALLOCATION OF TAXES. The Company will, unless prohibited by applicable Law,
close the taxable period of each of the Acquired Entities as of the close of
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section, in the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Taxable period which
begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion
of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon
or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which    54   is the number of days in the entire Taxable
period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a
Taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be
taken into account as though the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing
Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations of income, gains, loss, deduction, and credits shall be made in a
manner consistent with prior practice of the Company.   (b) CLOSING TAX
RETURNS. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns for the Acquired Entities for all periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date which are required to be filed after the
Closing Date and all Tax Returns for the Company for Tax periods which begin
before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (the "CLOSING TAX
RETURNS"). The Company shall cause copies of such Closing Tax Returns
(other than informational returns such as Forms 1099 and Forms W-2) to be
delivered to Parent and the Sellers\' Representative at least 45 days prior
to the filing date for their review and approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent and the Sellers\' Representative
shall give any comments on such Closing Tax Returns in writing to the
Company, with a copy to Parent or the Sellers\' Representative, as
applicable, within 10 days following the delivery of the Closing Tax Returns.
The Company, Parent and the Sellers\' Representative shall attempt in good
faith mutually to resolve any disagreements regarding such Closing Tax
Returns prior to the due date for filing thereof. Any disagreements regarding
such Closing Tax Returns which are not resolved by 30 days prior to the
filing date for such Closing Tax Returns shall be promptly referred to
the Neutral Accounting Firm. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall prepare the
final Closing Tax Return within 25 days of such referral, and such
preparation shall be final and binding on the Company, Parent and the
Sellers\' Representative. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accounting
Firm shall be paid equally by Parent and from funds paid out of the General
Indemnity Escrow Account.   (c) AMENDMENTS. Without the prior written
consent of the Sellers\' Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, neither the Company nor Parent shall file or cause to
be filed any amended return or claim for refund with respect to Taxes if any
such filing may affect the obligation of the Shareholders to provide
indemnification for any Tax Liability of an Acquired Entity pursuant to this
Agreement.   (d) COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS.   (i) After the Closing Date,
the Company, Parent and the  Sellers\' Representative shall cooperate fully,
as and to the  extent reasonably requested by the other parties, in
connection  with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any 
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such 
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon any other  party\'s
request) the provision of records and information which  are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other  proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient  basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any  material provided hereunder.   
55    (ii) Parent and the Company further agree, upon request, to  use
their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain any  certificate or other
document from any Governmental Body or any  other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate  any Tax that could be imposed (including,
but not limited to, with  respect to the Transactions).   (iii) Parent and
the Company further agree, upon request, to  provide the other Parties with
all information that such Party may  be required to report pursuant to
Section 6043 of the Code and all  Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.   (e) TAX PROCEEDINGS. After the Closing Date, in the case of
any audit, examination, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes ("TAX
PROCEEDING") for which the Security Holders are or may be partially or fully
liable to the Indemnified Parent Parties pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company shall inform the Sellers\' Representative within ten business days
after the receipt of any notice of such Tax Proceeding. The Company shall be
responsible for the management of the Tax Proceeding, provided that the
Sellers\' Representative shall have the right (1) to approve the Company\'s
choice of counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, (2) to
participate fully in the Tax Proceeding, either personally or through a
representative (including separate counsel of its own choosing at its sole
cost and expense) to the extent it is affected by such proceeding, (3) to
receive copies of all correspondence regarding the Tax Proceeding, and
reasonable advance notice from the Company of any meetings, hearings or
proceedings, (4) to review in advance and comment on any pleadings, briefs,
or other documents to be filed, and (5) to approve any judgment or
settlement, closing or other agreement with respect to any Tax Proceeding,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event
that at any time during the Tax Proceeding there is a proposed
closing agreement, settlement or other disposition of the Tax Proceeding
which the Sellers\' Representative wants to accept and the Company does not
want to accept, then the Sellers\' Representative may elect, on behalf of the
Security Holders, to pay the amount specified under the relevant proposal to
the Company. Upon such payment, the Company shall have sole control of the
Tax Proceeding and the Security Holders shall have no further liability to
the Parent Indemnified Parties under Section 8.2 with respect to the matters
covered by such Tax Proceeding.   (f) CERTAIN TAXES. All transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this
Agreement, if any, shall be paid by the Company when due, and the Company
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable
law, the Parent Parties will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.   (g) RETENTION
OF DOCUMENTS. The Company agrees (A) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Parent Parties, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and
(B) to    56   give the Sellers\' Representative reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the Sellers\' Representative so requests, the Company, shall
allow the Sellers\' Representative to take possession of such books and
records.   10.2 SCHEDULES.   (a) The disclosures on the Schedules, and
those in any supplement thereto, relate only to the representations and
warranties in the Section or paragraph of the Agreement to which they
expressly relate and not to any other representation or warranty in this
Agreement except to the extent a Section specifically allows for cross-
reference to other Sections and the Schedules provided thereunder.   (b) If
there is any direct inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement and those on the Schedules (other than an exception expressly set
forth on the Schedules with respect to a specifically
identified representation or warranty), the statements in the body of this
Agreement shall control.   (c) Nothing on the Schedules shall be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made
herein, unless the Schedules identify the exception with reasonable
particularity.   10.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.   This Agreement, together with
the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the confidentiality agreement between the
Company and Parent dated March 13, 2002, and the certificates, documents,
instruments, and writings that are delivered pursuant hereto, together
constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties in respect
of its and their subject matter and supersedes all prior understandings,
agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or the
Transactions, including without limitation the letter of intent dated May
7, 2002, between the Company and Parent.   10.4 NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES.   Except as expressly contemplated by ARTICLE 8, SECTION 2.9,
and SECTION 2.10, there are no third party beneficiaries having rights under
or with respect to this Agreement.   10.5 SUCCESSORS.   All of the terms,
agreements, covenants, representations, warranties, and conditions of this
Agreement are binding upon, and inure to the benefit of and are enforceable
by, the Parties and their respective successors. If a Shareholder is an
entity and if the principal business, operations, or a majority or
substantial portion of the assets of such Shareholder are assigned, conveyed,
allocated, or otherwise transferred, including by sale,
merger, consolidation, amalgamation, conversion, or similar transactions,
such receiving Person or Persons shall automatically become bound by the
subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and such Shareholder shall cause
the receiving Person or Persons to expressly assume its obligations
hereunder.    57    10.6 ASSIGNMENTS.   No Party may assign either
this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder
without the prior written approval of Parent and (i) before the Closing, the
Company, and (ii) after the Closing, the Sellers\' Representative; provided,
however, that Parent may (a) assign any or all of its rights and interests
hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and (b) designate one or more of
its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which
cases Parent nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all
of its obligations hereunder).   10.7 NOTICES.   All notices, requests,

Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged
irreparably if any provision of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise Breached.
Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent Beaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms and
provisions in any Action instituted in any court of the United States or any
state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter, subject to
SECTIONS 10.9 and 10.13, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled, at Law or in equity.   59     10.9 SUBMISSION TO
JURISDICTION; NO JURY TRIAL.   (a) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. Each Party
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts sitting in New
York City, New York, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard
and determined in any such court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in
any Action so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by Action on
the judgment or in any other manner provided at Law or in equity. Each Party
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Action so
brought and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be required
of any other party with respect thereto.   (b) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE
PARTIES EACH HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO JURY TRIAL OF
ANY DISPUTE BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR ANY DEALINGS AMONG THEM RELATING TO THE
TRANSACTIONS. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all encompassing of
any and all Actions that may be filed in any court and that relate to the
subject matter of the Transactions, including, Contract claims, tort claims,
breach of duty claims, and all other common law and statutory claims. The
Parties each acknowledge that this waiver is a material inducement to enter
into a business relationship and that they will continue to rely on
the waiver in their related future dealings. Each Party further represents
and warrants that it has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel, and
that each knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following
consultation with legal counsel. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
HEREIN, THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED
ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS, OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO. In the event of an Action, this Agreement may be
filed as a written consent to trial by a court.   (c) SERVICE OF PROCESS.
Any Party may make service on any other Party by sending or delivering a copy
of the process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in SECTION 10.7. Nothing in this SECTION

relating to this Agreement in any other court or to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted at Law or in equity.   10.10 TIME.   Time is of
the essence in the performance of this Agreement.   10.11 COUNTERPARTS.

shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.   10.12 HEADINGS.   The article and section
headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.    60    10.13 GOVERNING LAW.   Except for any other Law of
mandatory application, this Agreement and the performance of the Transactions
and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed

to any choice of Law principles.   10.14 AMENDMENTS.   The Parties may
amend this Agreement by action taken by or on behalf of the respective Boards
of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company at any time prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Shareholders approve
and adopt this Agreement and the Merger, no amendment to this Agreement may
be made that would reduce the amount of or change the Merger Consideration or
otherwise would require the Shareholders to approve such amendment under the
Corporate Law, unless the Shareholders approve such amendment in accordance
with the Corporate Law. Amendments to this Agreement must be in a writing
that the Company and Parent Parties have signed.   10.15 EXTENSIONS;
WAIVER.   (a) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
Parties, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, to the extent

obligations of the other Party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of

valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party.   (b) No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation,
or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, may
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation,
or Breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising because of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.   10.16
SEVERABILITY.   The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof; provided that if
any provision of this Agreement, as applied to any Party or to any
circumstance, is adjudged by a Governmental Body, arbitrator, or mediator not
to be enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Parties agree that the
Governmental Body, arbitrator, or mediator making such determination shall
have the power to modify the provision in a manner consistent with its
objectives such that it is enforceable, and/or to delete specific words or
phrases, and in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable
and shall be enforced.    61    10.17 EXPENSES.   Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, each Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the Transactions, including all fees and
expenses of agents, representatives, financial advisors, legal counsel, and
accountants.   10.18 CONSTRUCTION.   The Parties have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party because of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal,
state, local, or foreign Law shall be deemed also to refer to Law as amended
and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. The words "include," "includes," and "including" shall be
deemed to be followed by "without limitation." Pronouns in masculine,
feminine, and neuter genders shall be construed to include any other gender,
and words in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and
vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The words
"this Agreement," "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder," and words of
similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The Parties intend that each
representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant.  
10.19 INCORPORATION OF EXHIBITS, ANNEXES, AND SCHEDULES.   The Exhibits and
Schedules are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.  
10.20 ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES.   (a) Notwithstanding the Electronic Signatures
in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001 ET.SEQ.), the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or any other Law relating to or enabling
the creation, execution, delivery, or recordation of any Contract or
signature by electronic means, and notwithstanding any course of conduct
engaged in by the Parties, no Party shall be deemed to have executed a
Transaction Document or other document contemplated thereby (including any
amendment or other change thereto) unless and until such Party shall have
executed such Transaction Document or other document on paper by a
handwritten original signature or any other symbol executed or adopted by a
Party with current intention to authenticate such Transaction Document or
such other document contemplated.   (b) Delivery of a copy of a Transaction
Document or such other document bearing an original signature by facsimile
transmission (whether directly from one facsimile device to another by means
of a dial-up connection or whether mediated by the worldwide web), by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other
electronic means    62   intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, shall have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature. "Originally
signed" or "original signature" means or refers to a signature that has not
been mechanically or electronically reproduced.   10.21 POST-CLOSING
INDEMNIFICATION.   The Company will purchase a tail policy with respect to
the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which policy will be effective
