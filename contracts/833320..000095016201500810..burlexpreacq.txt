but in any event not later than 11:59 p.m. (Calgary  time) on October 19,
2001, an offer to purchase all of the outstanding  Canadian Hunter Shares
(including the associated Rights) including any  Canadian Hunter Shares which

Hunter Options and pursuant to the  exchange of outstanding Deferred Share
Units, for a price of $53.00 in cash  for each Canadian Hunter Share which
offer shall be made in accordance with  this Agreement, the Act and
Securities Laws and be subject to the  conditions set forth in Schedule A
hereto (the "Offer", which term shall  include any amendments to, or
extensions of, such Offer, including, without  limitation, increasing the
consideration, removing or waiving any condition  or extending the date by
which Canadian Hunter Shares may be tendered).  Burlington and Canadian
Hunter shall cooperate in making on a timely basis  any filings with respect
to the Offer, including amendments thereafter on a  timely basis as required
by Securities Laws. The Offer shall be prepared in  both the English and
French languages and in accordance with this  Agreement, the Act and
Securities Laws. Burlington shall provide Canadian  Hunter with a draft copy
of the Offer Documents prior to mailing for its  review and comment.  (b)
Burlington may make the Offer itself or through any direct or indirect 
subsidiary. In the event that a Burlington subsidiary makes or participates 
in the making of the Offer, the term "Burlington" as used herein shall 
include such subsidiary, other than in Article 5 where the term    6   
"Burlington" shall not include such subsidiary, but Burlington shall 
continue to be liable to Canadian Hunter, as principal obligor, for such 
subsidiary\'s obligations hereunder and for any default by such subsidiary 
in the performance of its obligations hereunder.  (c) The Offer shall expire
at the Initial Expiry Time, except that the Offer  may be extended, at the
sole discretion of Burlington, if the conditions  thereto set forth in
Schedule A hereto are not satisfied on the date and  time at which the Offer
expires and if Burlington determines, acting  reasonably, that there is a
reasonable prospect that the conditions of the  Offer may not be satisfied
prior to the Expiry Time. In addition, in the  event that any appropriate
regulatory approval is not obtained prior to the  time the Offer is scheduled
to terminate, unless such approval has been  denied, Burlington agrees that
it will extend the Offer for not less than  two additional successive 10 day
periods, if upon the expiry of any  extension, the appropriate regulatory
approval has not been obtained.   In the event that at the Expiry Time, all
conditions of the Offer contained  in Schedule A hereto have been satisfied
or waived other than the condition  set forth in paragraph (g) of Schedule A,
Burlington hereby agrees to  extend the Offer for a period of time not less
than 10 days past the Expiry  Time. If the condition set forth in paragraph
(g) of Schedule A is not  satisfied at the end of the extended Offer period,
Burlington shall have no  further obligation to extend the Offer.   Subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in  Schedule A
hereto, Burlington shall within three Business Days accept for  payment and
pay for all Canadian Hunter Shares validly tendered (and not  properly
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer. Each of Burlington and Canadian  Hunter
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the  Offer,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof.  (d) It is agreed that
Burlington may, in its sole discretion, waive any term or  condition of the
Offer for its benefit provided that if Burlington takes up  and pays for any
Canadian Hunter Shares it shall acquire not less than the  Minimum Required
Shares. Burlington agrees that it shall not amend any term  or condition of
the Offer (which for greater certainty, does not include  waiving, in whole
or part, a condition of the Offer) in a manner that is  materially adverse to
the holders of Canadian Hunter Shares without the  prior written consent of
Canadian Hunter other than to: (i) comply with  Section 2.1(c); (ii) extend
the Offer, if, at the initial or extended date  on which the Offer is
scheduled to terminate, any of the conditions to the  Offer shall not be
satisfied or waived by Burlington, until such time as  such conditions are
satisfied or waived by Burlington; (iii) extend the  Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or  position of the
Securities Authorities applicable to the Offer or any  period required by
applicable law; or (iv) comply with the legal  obligations of Burlington with
respect to any amendment, modification or  change of the Offer.  
Notwithstanding and without limiting the foregoing, Burlington may at any 
time following the Initial Expiry Time, reduce the Minimum Condition to a 
percentage not less than 50% (exclusive of any Canadian Hunter Shares that 
Burlington owned prior to the date the Offering Documents are mailed) and 
shall, subject to the conditions of the Offer being satisfied or waived, 
take up and pay for all Canadian Hunter Shares validly deposited to the 
Offer, provided that, after Burlington reduces the Minimum Condition, 
Burlington extends the Offer by a 10 day period and agrees to extend the 
Offer for not less than two additional successive 10 day periods if, upon 
the expiry of any extension, the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied. 
Any agreement of Burlington referred to in the foregoing sentence shall 
continue after the Effective Time until such agreement shall have been 
performed or this Agreement is terminated.   Burlington shall provide a
draft of any proposed amendment, modification or  change to the Offer to
Canadian Hunter.  (e) Burlington will instruct the depositary under the
Offer to advise Canadian  Hunter from time to time, not less frequently than
every three Business  Days until the day immediately prior to the Expiry Time
and thereafter on  an hourly basis, if requested by Canadian Hunter and in
such     7    manner as Canadian Hunter may reasonably request, as to
the number of  Canadian Hunter Shares that have been tendered (and not
withdrawn) under  the Offer.  (f) Burlington\'s obligation to make the
Offer as set forth in Section 2.1(a) is  conditional upon the execution and
delivery to Burlington, concurrently  with the execution of this Agreement,
of pre-tender agreements referred to  in Section 2.2(b).  (g)
Notwithstanding any of the other terms of this Agreement, Burlington shall 
not be required to make the Offer if, on or before the date Burlington  would
otherwise be required to make the Offer under the terms of this 
Agreement:   (i) any of the representations or warranties of Canadian Hunter
contained  herein shall not be true and correct in all material respects or 
Canadian Hunter shall not have complied in all material respects with  each
of its covenants set out herein; or   (ii) the Board of Directors of
Canadian Hunter shall have withdrawn its  positive recommendation of the
Offer; or   (iii) a Material Adverse Change shall have occurred, or a person
shall have  commenced a bona fide action for injunctive relief against the 
performance of this Agreement or the completion of the Offer, or  another
event shall have occurred or circumstances shall exist which  would make it
impossible or highly unlikely to satisfy one or more of  the conditions of
the Offer set forth in Schedule A hereto.  The foregoing conditions are for
the sole benefit of Burlington and may be waived by Burlington at any
time.   .2 Canadian Hunter Directors\' Circular  (a) Canadian Hunter
hereby consents to the Offer as set forth in Section 2.1  and confirms that
its Board of Directors has resolved that it will  recommend that holders of
Canadian Hunter Shares accept the Offer, has  approved the entering into of
this Agreement and has received the opinion  of its financial advisors that
the consideration payable pursuant to the  Offer is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Canadian  Hunter Shares and has resolved to
unanimously recommend acceptance of the  Offer by the holders of Canadian
Hunter Shares, subject to Section 8.3.  Canadian Hunter shall prepare and
make available for mailing with the  Offer, in both the English and French
languages, sufficient copies of a  directors\' circular prepared in
accordance with Securities Laws. The  directors\' circular will set forth
(among other things) the recommendation  of the Board of Directors of
Canadian Hunter as described above. Canadian  Hunter shall provide Burlington
with a draft copy of the directors\'  circular prior to its finalization for
Burlington\'s review and comment.  (b) The Board of Directors of Canadian
Hunter has been advised that the  directors and officers of Canadian Hunter
intend to tender their Canadian  Hunter Shares under the Offer and have
agreed to elect that, in lieu of  exercising their Canadian Hunter Options,
Canadian Hunter will pay the  difference between the exercise price of their
Canadian Hunter Options and  the purchase price for the Canadian Hunter
Shares under the Offer  immediately after the Take-up Date in exchange for
the termination of their  Canadian Hunter Options and providing that such
director or officer agrees  to surrender any remaining unexercised options to
Canadian Hunter for  cancellation for no consideration effective immediately
after the Take-up  Date. Canadian Hunter represents that its director\'s and
officer\'s have  agreed to execute pre-tender agreements (in the form of the
agreement  attached hereto as Schedule B) and agrees to use its reasonable
best  efforts to deliver such agreements within 72 hours of the execution of
this  Agreement duly executed by all of its directors and officers. The 
directors\' circular shall reflect the execution and delivery of such  pre-
tender agreements and the agreement of the directors and officers to  tender
their Canadian Hunter Shares pursuant to the Offer.     8   (c)
Canadian Hunter represents that it has obtained advice from CIBC World 
Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs and Co. that the consideration to be offered  to
Canadian Hunter\'s shareholders pursuant to the Offer is fair to holders  of
Canadian Hunter Shares from a financial point of view and that such 
financial advisor will each provide a written opinion to such effect on or 
before October 19, 2001. The fairness opinions will be attached to or 
referred to in the directors\' circular referred to in Section 2.2(a).   .3
Offer Documents  (a) Burlington shall file or cause to be filed with the
appropriate Securities  Authorities an Offer to Purchase and Take-over Bid
Circular and the related  Letter of Transmittal and Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery pursuant to which  the Offer will be made (collectively, the "Offer
Documents"). The Offer  Documents, when filed with the Securities Authorities
and when mailed to  holders of Canadian Hunter Shares, shall contain (or
shall be amended in a  timely manner to contain) all information which is
required to be included  therein in accordance with the Act and any
applicable Canadian provincial  securities laws, United States securities
laws, the "blue sky" or  securities laws of the states of the United States
and any other applicable  law (collectively, the "Securities Laws").  (b)

agents may reasonably request in connection with communicating the Offer  and
any amendments and supplements thereto to the holders of the Canadian  Hunter
Shares and to such other persons as are entitled to receive the  Offer under
Securities Laws, including providing lists and updated or  supplemental lists
of the holders of Canadian Hunter Shares, holders of  Canadian Hunter Options

exchangeable for Canadian Hunter Shares and  mailing labels with respect to
all such holders of securities as soon as  possible after the date of this
Agreement but in any event no later than  the close of business in Calgary on
October 11, 2001 and updates or  supplements thereto from time to time as may
be requested by Burlington.   .4 Outstanding Stock Options and Deferred
Share Units  (a) Subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory
approvals, persons  holding options pursuant to the Stock Option Plan who may
do so under  Securities Laws and in accordance with the Stock Option Plan
shall be  entitled to exercise all of their options and tender all Canadian
Hunter  Shares issued in connection therewith under the Offer upon payment
by  certified cheque or bank draft of the exercise price in full. The
Canadian  Hunter Board of Directors shall not, prior to completion of the
Offer,  grant additional options pursuant to the Stock Option Plan. It is
agreed by  Burlington that all Canadian Hunter Options which have been
tendered to  Canadian Hunter for exercise, conditional on Burlington taking
up Canadian  Hunter Shares under the Offer ("Conditional Option Exercise"),
shall be  deemed to have been exercised concurrently with the take-up of
Canadian  Hunter Shares by Burlington. Furthermore, Burlington shall accept
as  validly tendered under the Offer as of the Take-up Date all Canadian
Hunter  Shares which are to be issued pursuant to the Conditional Option
Exercise,  provided that the holders of such options indicate that such
shares are  tendered pursuant to the Offer and provided that such holder
agrees to  surrender their remaining unexercised options to Canadian Hunter
for  cancellation for no consideration effective immediately after the Take-
up  Date.  (b) Canadian Hunter and Burlington agree that to the extent
holders of Canadian  Hunter Options do not exercise such Canadian Hunter
Options and tender the  Canadian Hunter Shares they receive upon such
exercise, Canadian Hunter may  agree with all remaining holders of Canadian
Hunter Options that, in lieu  of such persons exercising their Canadian
Hunter Options, Canadian Hunter  will pay to such persons the difference
between the exercise price of their  Canadian Hunter Options and the purchase
price for the Canadian Hunter  Shares under the Offer immediately after the
Take-up Date of the Offer in  exchange for the termination of their Canadian
Hunter Options and provided  that such holders agree to surrender their
remaining unexercised options to    9    Canadian Hunter for
cancellation for no consideration effective immediately  after the Take-up
Date.  (c) Persons holding Deferred Share Units shall be entitled to
exchange all of  their Deferred Share Units for Canadian Hunter Shares and
tender all  Canadian Hunter Shares issued in connection therewith to the
Offer.  (d) Burlington and Canadian Hunter acknowledge and agree that,
pursuant to the  Stock Option Plan and Deferred Share Unit Plan, all
outstanding and  unvested Canadian Hunter Options and all outstanding
Deferred Share Units,  respectively, shall immediately vest at the Effective
Time.   .5 Rights Plan  (a) Canadian Hunter represents to Burlington that
its Board of Directors has  irrevocably resolved to waive the application of
the Rights Plan to the  Offer immediately prior to the Expiry Time and to any
other actions taken  by Burlington in furtherance of acquiring all of the
Canadian Hunter Shares  and covenants to Burlington to take all action
necessary pursuant to the  Rights Plan to effect such waiver no earlier than
the Expiry Time, and to  ensure that the Separation Time (as defined in the
Rights Plan) does not  occur.  (b) Canadian Hunter covenants and agrees
with Burlington and represents to  Burlington that its Board of Directors has
resolved not to waive the  application of the Rights Plan or to redeem any of
the outstanding Rights  or take any other action which would limit the

Proposal that expires no  sooner than the Initial Expiry Time.   .6
Employee Plans  (a) Canadian Hunter shall terminate the Employee Share
Savings Plan and the  Share Purchase Plan subject to and coincident with the
first take-up of  Canadian Hunter Shares by Burlington under the Offer on the
Take-up Date  and shall make whatever arrangements may be necessary to permit
the  participants in such plans to tender the Canadian Hunter Shares
allocated,  or to be allocated, as the case may be, to them on termination of
such  plans under the Offer. Burlington and Canadian Hunter acknowledge and
agree  that, pursuant to the Share Purchase Plan, all outstanding loans
between  Canadian Hunter and a Participant (as defined in such plan) shall be
due  and payable on the Take-up Date and that all outstanding amounts shall
be  netted against any amounts due from Burlington under the Offer to the 
Participants (as defined in such Plan).  (b) Subject to and following the

up Date, Burlington covenants and  agrees that, effective upon the
termination of the Employee Share Savings  Plan pursuant to Section 2.6(a)
and up to and including the date (the  "Rollover Date") which is the earlier
of (i) the date that such participant  is covered under Burlington\'s stock
purchase savings plan and (ii) December  31, 2001, Burlington shall cause
Canadian Hunter to make all necessary  arrangements so that all participants
in such plan prior to the Take-up  Date shall continue to have the same

Burlington shall cause Canadian Hunter to pay  all such accumulated
contributions to such participants together with an  amount equal to (i) in
the case of participants who continue to be employed  by Canadian Hunter on
the Rollover Date, the actual contributions made by  such participants up to
and including the Rollover Date and (ii) in the  case of participants who are
terminated on or prior to the Rollover Date,  the maximum amount such
participants could have contributed under the  Employee Share Savings Plan up
to and including the Rollover Date had they  not been terminated, provided,
however, where a participant has been  terminated for just cause, Canadian
Hunter shall only be required to pay an  amount equal to such participant\'s
actual contributions.     10   (c) Subject to and following the take-up
of Canadian Hunter Shares by  Burlington under the Offer, Burlington

employees of Canadian Hunter  bonus amounts in respect of the calendar year
ending December 31, 2001 in  accordance with Canadian Hunter\'s customary
year end bonus practices  consistently applied in accordance with prior years
(the "Canadian Hunter  Year End Bonus Arrangements"). Canadian Hunter and
Burlington agree that  bonus amounts for December 31, 2001 to be paid to the
eight officers of  Canadian Hunter with employment contracts shall be the
same amounts as paid  to such employees for the December 31, 2000 calendar
year.  (d) Subject to and following the take-up of Canadian Hunter Shares
by  Burlington under the Offer on the Take-up Date, Burlington covenants
and  agrees to cause Canadian Hunter to apply Canadian Hunter\'s current
and  historical practices related to severance and termination payments
payable  to its employees as described in the Disclosure Letter until at
least  December 31, 2002.  (e) Subject to and following the take-up of
Canadian Hunter Shares by  Burlington under the Offer on the Take-up Date,

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Burlington and Canadian 
Hunter shall not issue any such press release or make any such public 
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by

Laws (including by way of compulsory acquisition) following completion of the
Offer.   .2 Information Circular, Etc.   Without limiting Section 4.1,

Canadian laws, the Canadian Hunter Governing Documents and the requirements
of The Toronto Stock Exchange or any other regulatory authority having
jurisdiction to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders as promptly as practicable to consider and vote upon the action
proposed by Burlington. In the event of such a meeting or meetings, Canadian
Hunter shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to mail to
its shareholders an Information Circular with respect to the meeting of
Canadian Hunter\'s shareholders. The term "Information Circular" shall mean
such proxy or other required informational statement or circular, as the case

shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading and will comply in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of law. Burlington and Canadian Hunter each agree to
correct promptly any such information provided by it for use in any
Information Circular which shall have become false or misleading.   ARTICLE

Canadian  Hunter\'s independent accountants or (ii) in the case of unaudited
interim  financial statements, to the extent they may not include footnotes
or may  be condensed or summary statements), and fairly present the
consolidated  financial position, results of operations and changes in
financial position  of Canadian Hunter and its consolidated subsidiaries as

makes no  representation) will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or  omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to  make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they  are made, not misleading and will comply in all material

statements of  Canadian Hunter issued by Canadian Hunter or to be included in
such reports  and statements (excluding any information therein provided by
Burlington,  as to which Canadian Hunter makes no representation) will be

to normal year-end  audit adjustments).     16    .12 Subsidiaries  
All of the shares (or partnership interests) of the Canadian
Hunter Subsidiaries are beneficially wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by
Canadian Hunter with valid and marketable title thereto, free and clear of
any and all liens, charges, security interests, adverse claims, encumbrances
and demands of any nature or kind whatsoever. The Canadian Hunter
Subsidiaries are the only material subsidiaries of Canadian Hunter.   .13
Compliance with Law   Canadian Hunter and each of its subsidiaries has
complied with and is in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable
to the operation of its business, except where such non-compliance would not,
considered individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect
on the business, affairs, operations, assets, prospects or financial
condition of Canadian Hunter and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on
the ability of Canadian Hunter to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.   .14 Material Agreements   There are no agreements material to
the conduct of Canadian Hunter\'s and its subsidiaries\' businesses except
land contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business and
construction, ownership and operation agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business and the agreements as listed in the Disclosure Letter, and
all such agreements are valid and subsisting and Canadian Hunter or its
subsidiary, as applicable, is not in material default under any such
agreements.   .15 Disclosure   Canadian Hunter has disclosed to Burlington
in the Disclosure Letter any information regarding any event, circumstance or
action taken or failed to be taken which could reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the business, operations, assets, capitalization,
financial condition, prospects, rights or liabilities of or relating to
Canadian Hunter and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.   To the best of
Canadian Hunter\'s knowledge, none of the information delivered to Burlington
prior to the date hereof and as modified or supplemented from time to time
prior to the date hereof is misleading or incorrect in any material respect
taken as a whole, in light of the circumstances under which it was made,
excluding all financial projections concerning Canadian Hunter and
its subsidiaries.   .16 Employment Agreements   Except as listed in the
Disclosure Letter, neither Canadian Hunter nor any subsidiary is a party to
any written employment or consulting agreement or any verbal employment or
consulting agreement with a term of more than one year or any written
agreement which provides for a payment by Canadian Hunter or any subsidiary
on a change of control of Canadian Hunter or severance of employment.   .17
U.S. Securities Law Matters   To Canadian Hunter\'s knowledge, less than 40%

date, as the case may be, except where failure to make any such contribution
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

Hunter and each subsidiary have been maintained in accordance with all
applicable statutory requirements and are complete and accurate in all
material respects.   .20 Litigation, Etc.   There are, at the date hereof,

of Canadian Hunter or Burlington to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.   .21 Environmental   Except as set forth in the Disclosure

Canadian Hunter with that of Burlington immediately upon but not prior to,
the Effective Time without causing any unreasonable disruptions to Canadian
Hunter\'s business or operations prior to the Effective Time.   ARTICLE 8 
COVENANTS OF CANADIAN HUNTER   .1 Notice of Material Change   From the
date hereof until the termination of this Agreement, Canadian Hunter shall
promptly notify Burlington in writing of:  (a) any material change (actual,
anticipated, contemplated or, to the knowledge  of Canadian Hunter,
threatened, financial or otherwise) in the business,  affairs, operations,
assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise) or  capital of Canadian Hunter
and its subsidiaries considered as a whole;  (b) any change in any
representation or warranty set forth in Article 6 which  change is or may be
of such a nature as to render any such representation  or warranty misleading
or untrue in a material respect; or  (c) any material fact in respect of
Canadian Hunter which arises and which  would have been required to be stated
herein had the fact arisen on or  prior to the date of this Agreement.  
Canadian Hunter shall in good faith discuss with Burlington any change
in circumstances (actual, anticipated, contemplated or, to the knowledge
of Canadian Hunter, threatened, financial or otherwise) which is of such a
nature that there may be a reasonable question as to whether notice need to
be given to Burlington pursuant to this section.   .2 Non-Completion
Fee   If at any time after the execution of this Agreement (and provided
there is no material breach or non-performance by Burlington of a material
provision of this Agreement in any respect):  (a) the Board of Directors of
Canadian Hunter has withdrawn or, in any manner  adverse to Burlington,
redefined, modified or changed any of its  recommendations referred to in
Section 2.2, or shall have resolved to do  so;  (b) any bona fide Take-over
Proposal for the Canadian Hunter Shares is publicly  announced or commenced,
and the Board of Directors of Canadian Hunter shall  have failed to publicly
reaffirm and maintain its recommendation of the  Offer to Canadian Hunter\'s
shareholders within 10 days after the public  announcement or commencement of
any such Take-over Proposal;     22   (c) the Board of Directors of
Canadian Hunter shall have recommended that  Canadian Hunter\'s shareholders
deposit their Canadian Hunter Shares under,  vote in favour of, or otherwise
accept, a Take-over Proposal;  (d) Canadian Hunter shall have entered into
any agreement with any person with  respect to a Take-over Proposal prior to
the Expiry Time of the Offer,  excluding a confidentiality agreement entered
into in compliance with  Section 8.3; or  (e) a Take-over Proposal is
publicly announced, proposed, offered or made to  Canadian Hunter\'s
shareholders or to Canadian Hunter prior to the Expiry  Time of the Offer,
the Offer shall have expired by reason of the Minimum  Condition not being
satisfied, and such Take-over Proposal has been  completed within 180 days of
expiry of the Offer,   Canadian Hunter shall upon the occurrence of any such
event and in any event within one Business Day pay to Burlington the amount
of $85 million. Such payment shall be made in immediately available funds to
an account designated by Burlington. On the date of the earliest of any of
the events specified in Sections 8.2(a) to (e), Canadian Hunter shall be
deemed to hold such amount in trust for Burlington. In the event that a Take-
over Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered or made to holders of
Canadian Hunter Shares as contemplated by Section 8.2(e), Canadian Hunter
agrees to deliver to Burlington, at least 3 Business Days prior to the
scheduled expiry of such Take-over Proposal, an irrevocable letter of credit,
in form satisfactory to Burlington, acting reasonably, drawable within one
Business Day after Burlington shall have delivered to the issuing party a
written certificate confirming the occurrence of an event specified in
Section 8.2(e) or such other form of security as is satisfactory to
Burlington, acting reasonably.   Any payment pursuant to Section 8.2 shall
be without prejudice to the rights or remedies available to Burlington upon
the breach of any provision of this Agreement.   For the purposes of
Section 8.2(b), an announcement by the Board of Directors of Canadian Hunter
that it does not have all the information necessary to properly evaluate the
Take-over Proposal and accordingly is reaffirming and maintaining its
recommendation of the Offer pending receipt and analysis of additional
information shall not constitute an event within the ambit of Section 8.2(b)
hereof or trigger any obligations to make the payment contemplated by this
Section, provided that the Board of Directors of Canadian Hunter, not
less than five days before the Expiry Time of the Offer, publicly reaffirms
and maintains its recommendation of the Offer as set forth in Section 2.2(a)
to holders of Canadian Hunter Shares without the foregoing qualification in
respect of receipt and analysis of additional information relating to the
Take-over Proposal.   .3 No Solicitation   Canadian Hunter shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation,
initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any
parties conducted heretofore by Canadian Hunter, any of its subsidiaries or
their officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, representatives and
agents ("Representatives") with respect to a Take-over Proposal (as defined
herein) whether or not initiated by Canadian Hunter and in connection
therewith, Canadian Hunter shall not release any third party from
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which Canadian Hunter and such
third party is a party or amend any of the foregoing and shall exercise all
rights to require the return of information regarding Canadian Hunter. From
and after the date hereof, Canadian Hunter and its subsidiaries will not, and
will not authorize or permit any of their Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
information) or participate in or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes or may reasonably
be expected to lead to a Take-over Proposal from any person, or engage in any
discussion, negotiations or inquiries relating thereto or accept any Take-
over Proposal; provided, however, that Canadian Hunter may: (i) engage in
discussions or negotiations with a third party who (without any solicitation,
initiation or encouragement, directly or indirectly, by Canadian Hunter, any
of its subsidiaries or the Representatives after the date hereof) seeks to
initiate such discussions or negotiations and may furnish such third party
information concerning Canadian Hunter and its business, properties    
23   and assets which has previously been provided to Burlington if, and
only to the extent that: (A) the third party has first made a bona fide
written Take-over Proposal that is financially superior to the Offer (as
determined in good faith in each case by Canadian Hunter\'s Board of
Directors after receiving the advice of its financial advisors) (a "Superior
Proposal") and Canadian Hunter\'s Board of Directors has concluded in good
faith, after considering applicable law and receiving the advice of outside
counsel that such action is required by the Canadian Hunter Board of
Directors to comply with fiduciary duties under applicable law; (B) prior to
furnishing such information to or entering into discussions or negotiations
with such person or entity, Canadian Hunter receives from such person or
entity an executed confidentiality agreement having confidentiality and
standstill terms substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; (C) Canadian Hunter immediately provides
to Burlington any information provided to any such person or entity if
not previously provided to Burlington; (ii) comply with applicable Securities
Laws relating to the provision of directors\' circulars, and make
appropriate disclosure with respect thereto to Canadian Hunter\'s
shareholders; and (iii) accept, recommend, approve or implement a Superior
Proposal contemplated in clause (i)(A), but only (in the case of this clause
(iii)) if prior to such acceptance, recommendation, approval or
implementation, Canadian Hunter\'s Board of Directors shall have concluded in
good faith, after considering provisions of applicable law and after giving
effect to all proposals to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Offer which may be offered by Burlington during the 24 hour notice
period set forth below Canadian Hunter terminates this Agreement in
accordance with Sections 8.2 and 11.1(f) and concurrently therewith has paid
the fees payable thereunder. Canadian Hunter shall give Burlington orally and
in writing at least 24 hours advance notice of any decision by the Board of
Canadian Hunter to accept, recommend, approve or implement a
Superior Proposal. Such notice shall include the principal business terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal and the general attributes of any non-
cash consideration but shall not include the identity of the party making
the Superior Proposal.   .4 Canadian Hunter Board of Directors   The
Board of Directors of Canadian Hunter immediately following the acquisition
by Burlington of more than 50% of the outstanding Canadian Hunter Shares
pursuant to the Offer shall be reconstituted through resignations of
all existing Canadian Hunter directors and the appointment of Burlington
nominees in their stead. Canadian Hunter shall, in accordance with the
foregoing and subject to the provisions of the Act, assist Burlington to
secure the resignations of all Canadian Hunter directors to be effective at
such time as may be required by Burlington and to use its best efforts to
cause the election of the Burlington nominees to fill the vacancies so
created in order to effect the foregoing without the necessity of a
shareholder meeting.   .5 Structure of Transaction   Canadian Hunter
shall, to the extent reasonable, cooperate with Burlington in structuring the
acquisition by Burlington of Canadian Hunter in a tax efficient manner,
including without limitation, by completing to the satisfaction of
Burlington, acting reasonably, a possible internal corporate reorganization
of Canadian Hunter involving the transfer of certain assets to one or more
partnerships and/or the transfer of certain assets or unincorporated business
divisions to separate wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary
corporations. Burlington shall indemnify Canadian Hunter for all costs and
taxes in connection with the foregoing.   .6 Financial and Other
Information   Canadian Hunter shall make available to Burlington, and
consents to the use of, all financial statements and other information of
Canadian Hunter which may be required to be disclosed in the Offer or in
other Burlington documents, including any proxy statement of Burlington and
any registration statement filed by Burlington with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, and amendments thereto, as required under
applicable law. Such financial statements shall be prepared in accordance
with Canadian GAAP. If required under applicable law, Canadian Hunter shall
make available to Burlington, and shall assist in the preparation of and
consents to the use of, reconciliations of such financial statements to
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, prepared
in     24   accordance with Item 18 of Form 20-F under the United
States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. If required by applicable
law, such financial statements shall be audited by Canadian Hunter\'s
auditors. Canadian Hunter shall use its best efforts to have its auditors, to
the extent required under applicable law, provide their consent to the use of
their report and the use of their name in connection with any disclosure by
Burlington of such financial statements. Burlington agrees to reimburse
Canadian Hunter for its reasonable third party expenses in connection with
complying with this Section 8.6.   ARTICLE 9  COVENANTS OF burlington

when the Offer is outstanding, Burlington shall not take any action, or fail

material respect at any time while the Offer is outstanding.   .2 Other
Covenants   Burlington covenants and agrees that, from and including the
date hereof until the termination of this Agreement, unless Canadian Hunter

commercial efforts to obtain all of the  regulatory approvals, waivers and

reasonably be expected to render, any representation or  warranty made by it
in this Agreement untrue in any material respect at any  time prior to expiry
of the Offer or termination of this Agreement,  whichever first occurs.

obligations.   ARTICLE 11  TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   .1

following the day of mailing of the Offer Documents; or  (e) by either

Expiry Time without Burlington taking up and paying for any of the  Canadian
Hunter Shares as a result of the failure of any condition to the  Offer to be
satisfied or waived unless the failure of such condition shall  be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to  perform the
obligations required to be performed by it under this  Agreement; or  (f)
by either Burlington or Canadian Hunter, if the fee referred to in Section 
8.2 becomes payable and payment is made or is immediately available to

TENDER AGREEMENT   October 8, 2001  Dear Sir:  Re: Offer by Burlington
to Purchase all of the Canadian Hunter
Shares --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Reference is made to the Pre-Acquisition Agreement dated October 8, 2001 (the
"Pre-Acquisition Agreement") between Burlington and Canadian Hunter pursuant
to which Burlington has agreed to make an offer to purchase all of the issued
and outstanding Canadian Hunter Shares. Unless otherwise defined herein, all
capitalized terms referred to herein shall have the meanings
attributed thereto in the Pre-Acquisition Agreement.   We understand that
you (the "Selling Shareholder") or your affiliates beneficially own, directly
or indirectly, or exercise control or direction over, the number of Canadian
Hunter Shares set forth in your acceptance at the end of this letter
agreement.   Any references in this letter agreement to Canadian Hunter
Shares owned by the Selling Shareholder shall mean such number of Canadian
Hunter Shares and, where the context requires, shall include all Canadian
Hunter Shares issued to the Selling Shareholder after the date hereof
pursuant to the exercise of Canadian Hunter Options.   This letter
agreement sets out the terms and conditions upon which the Selling
Shareholder has agreed, among other things, to support the Offer and
to deposit under the Offer, or cause to be deposited under the Offer, all of
the Canadian Hunter Shares (including Canadian Hunter Shares issuable upon
the exercise of Canadian Hunter Options) held by the Selling Shareholder that
are, or will be, beneficially owned or controlled by the Selling
Shareholder.  1. Covenants of Selling Shareholder   By the acceptance of
this letter agreement, the Selling Shareholder hereby agrees, subject to the
terms of paragraph 3 of this letter agreement, from the date hereof until the
earlier of the termination of this letter agreement and the Take-up
Date:  (a) not to sell, assign, convey or otherwise dispose of any of the
Canadian  Hunter Shares owned by such Selling Shareholder and not to permit
any  affiliate of such Selling Shareholder to sell, assign, convey or
otherwise  dispose of any of the Canadian Hunter Shares owned by it;  (b)
unconditionally and irrevocably to accept and to cause any affiliate of  such
Selling Shareholder to unconditionally and irrevocably accept the  Offer made
by Burlington by depositing the Canadian Hunter Shares presently  owned or
hereafter acquired (including any Canadian Hunter Shares hereafter  acquired
pursuant to the exercise of any options to purchase Canadian  Hunter Shares)
by such Selling Shareholder or affiliate prior to the Expiry  Time and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer;  (c) that they will
not exercise any Canadian Hunter Options and that they agree  to elect that,
in lieu of exercising their Canadian Hunter Options,  Canadian Hunter will
pay the difference between the exercise price of their  Canadian Hunter
Options and the purchase price for the Canadian Hunter  Shares under the
Offer immediately after the Take-up Date in exchange for  the termination of
their Canadian Hunter Options and provided the Selling  Shareholder agrees to
surrender their remaining unexercised options to  Canadian Hunter for
cancellation for no consideration effective immediately  after the Take-up
Date;     2   (d) that all loans made by Canadian Hunter to the Selling
Shareholder shall be  repaid in full on the Take-up Date and that all
outstanding amounts shall  be netted against any amounts due from Burlington
under the Offer to the  Selling Shareholder;  (e) not to exercise any
statutory or other rights of withdrawal with respect to  any Canadian Hunter
Shares owned by such Selling Shareholder or any  affiliate of such Selling
Shareholder once deposited pursuant to the Offer  unless this letter
agreement is terminated prior to Burlington taking up  the Canadian Hunter
Shares under the Offer; and  (f) not to exercise any shareholder rights or
remedies available at common law  or pursuant to the Business Corporations
Act (Alberta) or applicable  securities legislation to delay, hinder, upset
or challenge the Offer.  2. Covenants of Burlington  (a) Burlington shall
make the Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions  of the Pre-
Acquisition Agreement and shall comply with the terms and  conditions of
Article 2 and Sections 12.3 and 12.4 thereof in respect of  the Offer.  (b)
Burlington shall, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions 
set forth in the Offer, take up and pay for all Canadian Hunter Shares  owned
by the Selling Shareholder or any affiliate of the Selling  Shareholder
deposited pursuant to the Offer, all in accordance with the  terms and
conditions of the Offer and the provisions of the Pre-Acquisition 
Agreement.  3. Fiduciary Duties   Nothing herein shall restrict or limit
the actions of any director or officer required to be taken in the discharge
of his fiduciary duties as a director or officer of Canadian Hunter.  4.
Expenses   Burlington and the Selling Shareholder agree to pay their own
respective expenses incurred in connection with this letter agreement. Each
of the parties hereto agrees to indemnify the other against any claim for a
finder\'s fee or other compensation validly made by any broker which has an
agreement with such indemnifying party for the payment of such fee or
compensation. This paragraph 4 shall survive the termination of this letter
agreement pursuant to paragraph 5.  5. Termination   It is understood and
agreed that the respective rights and obligations hereunder of Burlington and
the Selling Shareholder shall cease and this letter agreement shall
terminate:  (a) if, prior to the expiry of the Offer, another bona fide
Take-over Proposal  is announced, proposed, offered or made to the holders of
Canadian Hunter  Shares or Canadian Hunter which, in the opinion of Canadian
Hunter\'s Board  of Directors after consultation with its financial advisors,
would  constitute a Superior Proposal and which permits the Board of
Directors of  Canadian Hunter to withdraw, modify or change any
recommendation regarding  the Offer in accordance with Section 2.2(a) of the
Pre-Acquisition  Agreement; or  (b) if the Canadian Hunter Board of
Directors otherwise withdraws, modifies or  changes any recommendation with
respect to the Offer; or  (c) if Burlington waives the Minimum Condition,
decreases the consideration  offered pursuant to the Offer or otherwise
modifies or amends the Offer in  a manner materially adverse to holders of
Canadian Hunter Shares, provided  that an extension of the Offer shall not
constitute an adverse modification  or amendment to the Offer; or    
3   (d) in the event that the Pre-Acquisition Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  Section 11.1 thereof.   In the event of termination of this
letter agreement, the Selling Shareholder may withdraw all of the Canadian
Hunter Shares deposited in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Offer, this letter agreement shall forthwith be of no further force and
effect and there shall be no obligation or liability on the part of either
the Selling Shareholder or Burlington, except as set forth in paragraph 4 and
this paragraph 5 which provisions shall survive the termination of this
letter agreement. Nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
any breach of this letter agreement.  6. Amendment   Except as expressly
set forth herein, this letter agreement constitutes the whole of the
agreement between the parties and may not be modified, amended, altered or
supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by the parties hereto.  7. Assignment   Except as expressly set
forth herein, no party to this letter agreement may assign any of its rights
or obligations under this letter agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party.  8. Disclosure   Prior to first public disclosure of
the existence and terms and conditions of this letter, none of the parties
hereto shall disclose the existence of this letter agreement, or any details
hereof, to any person other than Canadian Hunter, its directors and officers,
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except to the
extent required by law. The existence and terms and conditions of this letter
agreement may be disclosed by Burlington and Canadian Hunter in the press
release issued in connection with the execution of the Pre-Acquisition
Agreement and the Offer Documents and the Directors Circular prepared by
Canadian Hunter.  9. Enurement   This letter agreement will be binding
upon and enure to the benefit of Burlington, the Selling Shareholder and
their respective executors, administrators, successors and permitted
assigns.  10. Applicable Law   This letter agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the
federal laws of Canada applicable therein and each of the parties hereto
irrevocably attorns to the jurisdictions of the courts of the Province of
Alberta.     4   11. Counterparts   This letter agreement may be
signed in counterparts which together shall be deemed to constitute one valid
and binding agreement and delivery of such counterparts may be effected by
means of telecopier.  Yours truly,  BURLINGTON RESOURCES
