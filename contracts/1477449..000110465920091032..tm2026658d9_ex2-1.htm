maintains, and since July 24, 2019 has maintained, a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
Lafite&rsquo;s financial reporting and the preparation of the Lafite Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Lafite; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable

and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of Lafite that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Lafite&rsquo;s management
has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Lafite&rsquo;s system of internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31,
2019, and, except as set forth in the Lafite SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, that assessment
concluded that those controls were effective and disclosed to Lafite&rsquo;s independent public accounting firm and audit

or other employees who have a significant role in Lafite&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Since
December&nbsp;31, 2019, neither Lafite nor, to Lafite&rsquo;s Knowledge, Lafite&rsquo;s independent registered public
accounting firm, has identified or been made aware of any &ldquo;significant deficiencies&rdquo; or &ldquo;material
weaknesses&rdquo; (as such terms are defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of
such internal control over financial reporting utilized by Lafite that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to
Lafite&rsquo;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees of Lafite and its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in Lafite&rsquo;s

Agreement, request that each Person and its Representatives (other than Tempranillo and its Representatives) that has, prior
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, executed a confidentiality agreement or otherwise received non-public
information about Tempranillo from, or on behalf of, Tempranillo, in each case, in connection with such Person&rsquo;s
consideration of a Tempranillo Takeover Transaction, to promptly return or destroy all non-public information furnished to
such Person by or on behalf of Tempranillo or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement and
(C)&nbsp;immediately terminate access by any Third Party to any physical or electronic data room relating to any potential
Tempranillo Takeover Transaction. Tempranillo shall not modify, amend or terminate, or waive, release or assign, any
provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which Tempranillo or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party relating to any Tempranillo Takeover Proposal and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement; <U>provided</U>
that Tempranillo shall be permitted on a confidential non-public basis to release or waive any explicit or implicit
standstill obligations solely to the extent necessary to permit the relevant party thereto to submit a Tempranillo Takeover
Proposal to the Tempranillo Board on a confidential non-public basis and solely to the extent the Tempranillo Board
determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Tempranillo Board&rsquo;s fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Tempranillo shall provide written notice to Lafite of the waiver or release of any standstill by
Tempranillo within twenty-four (24) hours of such waiver or release, including disclosure of the identities of the parties
thereto and circumstances relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any
breach of the restrictions set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.02(a)</U> by any Representative of Tempranillo (solely for
this purpose as if the restrictions on Tempranillo set forth in this <U>Section 7.02(a)</U> applied directly to such
Representatives) shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this <U>Section&nbsp;7.02(a)</U> by Tempranillo.</P>

divestiture, disposition, license or other disposition of such of its and its Subsidiaries&rsquo; assets, properties or
businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by Tempranillo pursuant hereto, and enter into such

</FONT><U>Specific Performance; Remedies</U>. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which the parties are entitled at law or in equity, (a)&nbsp;the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened
or anticipated breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the courts
described in <U>Section&nbsp;11.07</U>, without proof of damages or otherwise, and (b)&nbsp;the right of specific performance is
an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither Lafite nor Tempranillo would have entered into this Agreement.
Each of the parties agrees that it waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and will not oppose the granting of an injunction
or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other parties have an adequate remedy
at law or (y) an award of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;11.09</U>
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.</P>
