filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
" _Delaware Secretary_ ").

  



  

(b)   _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on
such date and at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed
with the Delaware Secretary or at such later time and date as may be agreed
upon by the parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the DGCL (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

(c)   _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Lafite in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and Lafite shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and
shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Tempranillo, and the separate
corporate existence of Lafite, with all its rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises of Lafite and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Lafite and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger.

  



  

Section 2.02. _The Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place as soon as practicable (but in any event no later

permitted hereunder and by Applicable Law, waiver of all conditions set forth
in _Article 9_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted hereunder and by Applicable Law) of such conditions), unless

time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall
be held at the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, 1285
Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019, or remotely by exchange of

22

 



    



  

Section 2.03.   _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Tempranillo, Merger Sub,
Lafite or any stockholder thereof or any other Person:

  



  

(a)  except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.03(b)_,
_Section 2.03(c)_ or _Section 2.03(d)_, and subject to _Section 2.04(f)_,
each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive (i) 0.5920 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a fully paid,
validly issued and nonassessable share of Tempranillo Common Stock (the "
_Stock Consideration_ "), and (ii) $4.24 in cash, without interest (the "
_Cash Consideration_ " and together with the Stock Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). Upon conversion thereof in accordance with this
_Section 2.03(a)_, each such Share shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist and each holder of a
Certificate representing any such Shares shall have only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration with respect thereto in accordance with  _Section
2.04_. For the avoidance of doubt, in addition to the Merger Consideration,
immediately prior to and in connection with the Closing, holders of Shares
will receive the Special Dividend as contemplated by _Section 6.06_ ;

  



  

(b)  each Share owned by Tempranillo, Merger Sub or any other
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Tempranillo or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor and each
holder of a Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto;

  



  

(c)  each Share held in Lafite's treasury immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor and each holder of a
Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto;

  



  

(d)  each Share owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Lafite immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid or delivered
in exchange therefor and each holder of a Certificate representing any such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto; and

  



  

(e) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid, nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation as of immediately following the Effective Time.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

Section 2.04.   _Surrender and Exchange_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent and Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Tempranillo shall appoint a bank or a trust company
reasonably acceptable to Lafite to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.03(a)_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Tempranillo shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent,
(i) certificates representing the shares of Tempranillo Common Stock to be
issued as Stock Consideration and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in
an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash included in the Cash
Consideration and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.04(f)_ (such certificates and cash amounts, the " _Exchange Fund_
"). To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required to make prompt payment of any outstanding Merger Consideration to be
paid in exchange for Shares converted in the Merger pursuant to _Section
2.03(a)_, Tempranillo and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or
restore the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the Merger
Consideration. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination
of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three (3) months. To the extent such fund increases for
any reason above the level required to make prompt payment of any outstanding
Merger Consideration to be paid in exchange for Shares converted in the Merger
pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_, Tempranillo and the Surviving Corporation
shall, following such prompt payment, be the sole owners of any amounts left
over in such Exchange Fund. Tempranillo shall be treated for Tax purposes as
the owner of any cash held in the Exchange Fund prior to its disbursement,
and shall be subject to Tax on all interest and other income resulting from
investments of such cash. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event
no later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Tempranillo
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder
of Shares at the Effective Time, in each case whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.03(a)_, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that
delivery of the Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the certificate representing
the Shares (the " _Certificates_ "; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to include references to
effective affidavits of loss in accordance with _Section 2.10_ or to book-
entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares, as applicable)
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Tempranillo may reasonably specify (after due consultation with
Lafite) prior to the Effective Time) for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration for each
Share and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.04(f)_.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(b)   _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
represented by a Certificate promptly upon (i) surrender to the Exchange
Agent of the Certificate ( _provided_ , _however_ , that delivery of a book-
entry statement shall not be required in respect of any uncertificated Shares
held of record in book-entry), together with a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be
requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of the exchange of book-
entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, each such
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only
the right to receive such Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.04(f)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable
upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

  



  

(c)   _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of any Certificate or
cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.04(f)_ is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the
Person requesting such payment shall either pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment being made to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or otherwise
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d)   _No Other Rights_. The Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares paid upon the surrender of Certificates or book-

paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate or book-entry Share, and, from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not permit any further
registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Tempranillo or the Exchange Agent
for transfer, the holder of such Certificates shall be given a copy of a
letter of transmittal and instructed to comply with the instructions therein
in order to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding

respect to such Shares except to receive, upon surrender of a Certificate or
book-entry Share pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 2.04_, the

(e) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares at any
time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Tempranillo, upon demand, and any such holder who has
not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ prior to that time
shall, subject to abandoned property, escheat or other Applicable Laws,
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to _Section 2.09_)
as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares, in each case without any interest thereon.

  



  

(f)   _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of
Tempranillo Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Lafite Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 2.03_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Tempranillo
Common Stock (after taking into account all Shares exchanged by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of
Tempranillo Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported in _The Wall Street
Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually
selected by Tempranillo and Lafite) on the last complete trading day prior to
the date of the Effective Time.

2.03(d)_) and held by a holder who is entitled to demand appraisal and who
has properly demanded appraisal of such Shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn
nor lost such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL with respect to
such Shares (any such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws, waives or otherwise loses such holder's right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to
be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
holder's Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.03(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such
Certificate formerly representing such Shares. Lafite shall provide
Tempranillo with prompt written notice of any demands received by Lafite for
appraisal of any Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to Lafite prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and
Tempranillo shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Tempranillo, or if required by Applicable Law, Lafite shall not
make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Lafite's financial
reporting and the preparation of the Lafite Financial Statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of Lafite; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and the Lafite Board; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized

"material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined by the Public Company

control over financial reporting utilized by Lafite that would reasonably be
expected to be adverse to Lafite's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees of Lafite and its Subsidiaries who have
a significant role in Lafite's internal control over financial reporting.

financial) required to be disclosed by Lafite in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported to the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Lafite's management or to other
individuals responsible for preparing such reports as appropriate to allow

officer of Lafite required under the Exchange Act with respect to
such reports.

contract, plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy and each other
plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy (written or oral) providing

other than any plan, policy, program or arrangement mandated by Applicable
Law.

  



  

   

44

from the IRS; (iii) all material correspondence to or from any
Governmental Authority received in the last year with respect to any such

descriptions and any material modifications thereto, and all related trust
documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles, or a written
description of the material terms (if not in writing); _provided_ that, forms

(c)  Neither Lafite nor any ERISA Affiliate of Lafite sponsors,

exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, or has pending or has time remaining in which to
file an application for such determination from the IRS, no such
determination letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened,

obligation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such Lafite
Employee, (iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit
or compensation, (iv) accelerate the time of or otherwise trigger any funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any such compensation or benefits

procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the

control over financial reporting.

Section 6.02.   _Lafite Takeover Proposals; Lafite Adverse Recommendation
Change_.

  



  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.02_,
during the Pre-Closing Period, Lafite shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and Lafite's and each of its Subsidiary's respective
directors, officers and employees not to, and shall not authorize or permit
its other Representatives to, and shall direct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, propose, induce or knowingly
encourage or facilitate the making of any Lafite Takeover Proposal or any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Lafite Takeover Proposal, (ii) other than informing Third Parties of
the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.02_, enter
into, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in negotiations or
discussions with, or furnish any non-public information (or access thereto)
concerning Lafite or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party in
connection with, or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating,
or otherwise cooperate in any way with any Third Party (or any Representative
thereof) with respect to, a Lafite Takeover Proposal, (iii) except as set
forth below with respect to a confidentiality agreement in accordance with
_Section 6.02(b)_, recommend or enter into any Contract, letter of intent,
acquisition agreement, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other
agreement with respect to any Lafite Takeover Proposal or (iv) approve,
authorize, agree or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing.
Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Lafite and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall direct their respective Representatives to, (A)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or
knowingly permit any Representative to continue, any solicitation and any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Lafite Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry or request for information that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, or result in, a Lafite Takeover Proposal, (B) promptly, and in any
event within one (1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement, request that
each Person and its Representatives (other than Tempranillo and its
Representatives) that has, prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, executed a confidentiality agreement or otherwise received non-
public information about Lafite from, or on behalf of, Lafite, in each case,
in connection with such Person's consideration of a Lafite Takeover
Transaction, to promptly return or destroy all non-public information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Lafite or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the date of this Agreement and (C) immediately terminate access by
any Third Party to any physical or electronic data room relating to any
potential Lafite Takeover Transaction. Lafite shall not modify, amend or
terminate, or waive, release or assign, any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which
Lafite or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to any Lafite Takeover
Proposal and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_
 that Lafite shall be permitted on a confidential non-public basis to release
or waive any explicit or implicit standstill obligations solely to the extent
necessary to permit the relevant party thereto to submit a Lafite Takeover
Proposal to the Lafite Board on a confidential non-public basis and solely to
the extent the Lafite Board determines in good faith that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the Lafite Board's fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. Lafite shall provide written notice to Tempranillo of the
waiver or release of any standstill by Lafite within twenty-four (24) hours
of such waiver or release, including disclosure of the identities of the
parties thereto and circumstances relating thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any breach of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.02(a)_ by any Representative of
Lafite (solely for this purpose as if the restrictions on Lafite set forth in
this _Section 6.02(a)_ applied directly to such Representatives) shall be
deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section 6.02(a)_ by Lafite.

  



  

   

84

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if prior to the receipt of the Requisite Lafite Vote Lafite
receives a _bona fide_ written unsolicited Lafite Takeover Proposal (which
Lafite Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did
not result from a breach of this _Section 6.02_), and the Lafite Board
determines in good faith, after consultation on a confidential basis with
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation, that
such Lafite Takeover Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Lafite Superior Proposal, then Lafite and its Representatives may,
in each case subject to compliance with _Section 6.02(e)_ and the other
provisions of this Agreement: (i) furnish any information with respect to
Lafite and its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Lafite
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources); _provided_
that (A) prior to furnishing any such information, Lafite receives from such
Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement (1) containing terms that
are, in the aggregate, no less restrictive of the Third Party that is a party
to such agreement and its Affiliates and Representatives than the terms
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement are to Tempranillo and its
Affiliates and Representatives, provided that such confidentiality agreement
need not contain a "standstill" provision or other provisions having a similar
effect, and (2) that does not restrict, in any manner, Lafite's ability to
consummate the Transactions or to comply with its disclosure obligations to
Tempranillo pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) any such non-public
information so furnished has been previously provided or Made Available to
Tempranillo or is concurrently provided or Made Available (including through
the Lafite Data Room) to Tempranillo or (ii) participate or engage in
negotiations or discussions with, and only with, the Third Party making such
Lafite Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Lafite
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
understood that any breach of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of Lafite (solely for this purpose as if the
restrictions on Lafite set forth in this _Section 6.02(b)_ applied directly to
such Representatives) shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section
6.02(b)_ by Lafite.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.02_ (including
_Sections 6.02(d), (e)_ and _(g)_ ), neither the Lafite Board nor any
committee thereof shall (or resolve or agree to) (i) (A) withhold or withdraw
(or modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Tempranillo or Merger
Sub), or propose publicly to withhold or withdraw (or modify, amend
or qualify in a manner adverse to Tempranillo or Merger Sub), the Lafite
Board Recommendation (or the recommendation or declaration of advisability by
any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger), (B) approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, any Lafite Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to include the Lafite Board
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus when disseminated to
Lafite's stockholders or (D) resolve or agree to take any of the actions
described in clauses (A)-(C) (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve,
recommend, declare advisable or cause or permit Lafite to enter into any
Contract, letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or with
respect to, or which is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Lafite Takeover Proposal, other than a confidentiality agreement in
accordance with _Section 6.02(b)_ (an " _Alternative Lafite Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

  



  

   

85

 



    



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Lafite Vote, the
Lafite Board may make a Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Lafite Intervening Event if the Lafite Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national reputation, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
Lafite Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, _only if_  all of the
following conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(i)  Lafite shall have first provided Tempranillo an
Intervening Event Notice at least five (5) Business Days in advance advising
Tempranillo that Lafite intends to make a Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change
(it being understood and hereby agreed that the delivery and receipt of any
such Intervening Event Notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a
Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change) and specifying, in reasonable detail,
the Lafite Intervening Event;

  



  

(ii)  during the applicable Intervening Event Notice Period (or
any mutually agreed extension or continuation thereof), Lafite and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Tempranillo and its
officers, directors and Representatives regarding any changes to the terms of
this Agreement and any other proposals made by Tempranillo so that a failure
to effect a Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Lafite
Intervening Event would no longer be inconsistent with the Lafite
Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;

  



  

(iii)  Tempranillo does not make, within the applicable Intervening
Event Notice Period (or any extension or continuation thereof) after the
receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of
the Lafite Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of national reputation), cause the failure to effect a
Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Lafite Intervening
Event to no longer be inconsistent with the Lafite Board's fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material
change in any event, occurrence or facts relating to such Lafite Intervening
Event shall require a new Intervening Event Notice with a new Intervening
Event Notice Period ending on the earlier of (x) the day that is three (3)
Business Days after such material change and (y) the day that is ten (10) days
prior to the Lafite Stockholders Meeting); and

  



  

(iv)  following the Intervening Event Notice Period, Lafite Board
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation) that the failure
to effect a Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Lafite
Intervening Event continues to be inconsistent with the Lafite Board's
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

   

86

 



    



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Lafite Vote if,
in response to a _bona fide_ unsolicited written Lafite Takeover Proposal made
by a Third Party after the date of this Agreement which does not arise from a
breach of this _Section 6.02_ and has not been withdrawn, the Lafite Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of national reputation) that (1) such Lafite Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Lafite Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to make a
Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Lafite
Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Lafite Board may make
a Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change, _only if_ , in either such case, all
of the following conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(i)  Lafite shall have first provided to Tempranillo a
Superior Proposal Notice at least five (5) Business Days in advance advising
Tempranillo that the Lafite Board is prepared to effect a Lafite Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Lafite Superior Proposal (and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the material terms and conditions of any
such Lafite Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party
making any such Lafite Superior Proposal) (it being understood and hereby
agreed that the delivery and receipt of any such Superior Proposal Notice
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Lafite Adverse
Recommendation Change) and providing Tempranillo with a complete copy of any
written request, proposal or offer, including any proposed Alternative Lafite
Acquisition Agreement (and all schedules, appendices, exhibits and other
attachments relating thereto), and any other documents containing the
material terms of such Lafite Superior Proposal;

  



  

(ii)  during the applicable Superior Proposal Notice Period (or
any extension or continuation thereof), prior to its effecting a Lafite
Adverse Recommendation Change, Lafite and its Representatives shall negotiate
in good faith with Tempranillo and its officers, directors and
Representatives regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement and any other
proposals made by Tempranillo intended by Tempranillo to cause such Lafite
Takeover Proposal to no longer constitute a Lafite Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iii)  Tempranillo does not make, within the applicable Superior
Proposal Notice Period (or any mutually agreed extension or
continuation thereof) after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that
would, in the good faith judgment of the Lafite Board (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national reputation), cause the offer previously constituting a
Lafite Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Lafite Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment or modification of such
Lafite Superior Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice with a
new Superior Proposal Notice Period of three (3) Business Days);

  



  

(iv)  following the Superior Proposal Notice Period, Lafite Board
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation) that, in light
of such Lafite Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
proposed by Tempranillo, (x) such Lafite Takeover Proposal continues to
constitute a Lafite Superior Proposal, and (y) the failure to make Lafite
Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with the
Lafite Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(f) In addition to the obligations of Lafite set forth in

Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or
other modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the
Person making any such Lafite Takeover Proposal, request or
inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above,
Lafite (or its outside counsel) shall (A) keep Tempranillo (or its outside
counsel) reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding the
status and terms of discussions and negotiations relating to any such Lafite
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) Lafite shall, as promptly as

or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of Lafite that the Lafite Board has
determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its outside

6.02(g)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Lafite Board to make a Lafite
Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by _Section
6.02(d)_- _(e)_.

  



  

(h)  Notwithstanding (i) any Lafite Adverse Recommendation
Change, (ii) the making of any Lafite Takeover Proposal or (iii) anything in

release and termination in full on the Closing Date of all obligations and

Section 6.04.   _Convertible Notes and Capped Call Options_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
prior to the Effective Time, Lafite shall give any notices and take all
actions required by the terms of the Indenture, dated as of June 4, 2020 (the
" _Notes Indenture_ "), between Lafite and U.S. Bank National Association
(the " _Trustee_ "), the Convertible Notes or any applicable Law
(with respect to the Notes Indenture or the Convertible Notes) in connection
with the Merger and the Transactions, which actions shall include, without
limitation, Lafite (or its Subsidiaries or other Representatives, as
applicable) (i) giving any notices required by the Notes Indenture in
connection with the Merger and the Transactions, (ii) preparing any
supplemental indentures required by the Notes Indenture in connection with
the Merger and the Transactions and the consummation thereof to be executed
and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the Effective Time, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and Tempranillo and (iii)
taking all such further actions, including delivering any opinions of counsel
deliverable pursuant to the Notes Indenture prior to the Effective Time and
any officer's certificates necessary to comply with all of the terms and
conditions of the Notes Indenture in connection with the Merger and the
Transactions; _provided_ that Tempranillo shall use its reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Lafite with respect to the foregoing upon reasonable request by
Lafite, and provided further that opinions of counsel required by the Notes
Indenture, as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms and conditions
of the Notes Indenture in connection with the Merger and the Transactions
shall be delivered by Tempranillo and its counsel to the extent required
to be delivered at or after the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
Lafite shall not make any settlement election (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, by not delivering a Settlement Notice (as defined in the Notes
Indenture) with respect to any Conversion Date (as defined in the Notes
Indenture)) under the Notes Indenture without the prior written notice to
Tempranillo.

  



  

(b)  Lafite shall provide Tempranillo and its counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any notices, certificates, press
releases, supplemental indentures, legal opinions, officer's certificates or
other documents or instruments deliverable pursuant to or in connection with

reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective directors and officers to, and shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause its other Representatives to, take all actions reasonably requested by
Tempranillo in connection with making elections under, amending, negotiating
adjustments, obtaining waivers, and/or unwinding or otherwise settling the
Capped Call Options, _provided_ that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
each such election, amendment, negotiated adjustment, waiver, unwinding and
settlement shall take effect at or after the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise required by the terms of any Capped Call
Option, nothing in this _Section 6.04(c) _shall be interpreted as an
independent requirement for Lafite to be required to terminate or amend any
Capped Call Option prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the
foregoing, Lafite shall use its reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Tempranillo at Tempranillo's request in connection with, and at Tempranillo's

case, to the extent such affiliate or other person expressly represents the
interests of the counterparties to the Capped Call Options or is empowered to
make any determinations, adjustments, cancelations, terminations, exercises,
settlements or computations under the Capped Call Options (any such
counterparty, affiliate or person, a " _Hedge Counterparty_ "), with respect
to any determination, adjustment or computation in connection with the Capped
Call Options, including with respect to any cash amounts or Shares that may
be receivable by Lafite pursuant to the Capped Call Options. Lafite shall
promptly provide Tempranillo with any written notices or other documents
received from any Hedge Counterparty with respect to any adjustment,
determination, cancelation, termination, exercise, settlement or computation
under, or in connection with any discussions or negotiations related to, the
Capped Call Options. Lafite shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, except as contemplated herein, terminate or otherwise
settle the Capped Call Options, enter into any discussions, negotiations or
agreements in respect of the Capped Call Options or negotiate any adjustments,
make any elections, amendments, modifications or other changes to the terms
of the Capped Call Options without Tempranillo's prior written consent,
except as required pursuant to the terms thereof (as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms thereof) and
except any discussions, negotiations or agreements in respect of the Capped
Call Options or any elections, amendments, modifications or other changes to
the terms of the Capped Call Options, or any cash payments or share
deliveries with respect to the Capped Call Options that are, in each case,
contingent on the termination of this Agreement prior to the consummation of
the Merger (in each case, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "), which Alternative
Arrangements Lafite may enter into or make, as the case may be, in its sole
discretion, and shall use its reasonable efforts to keep Tempranillo fully
informed on a reasonably current basis of all such discussions and
negotiations and shall give Tempranillo the option to participate (or have
its counsel participate) in any such discussions and negotiations.
Tempranillo shall use its reasonable efforts to cooperate with Lafite with
respect to the foregoing upon reasonable request by Lafite. Lafite shall
provide Tempranillo and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any written response to any written notice or other document
received from any Hedge Counterparty with respect to any determination,
adjustment or computation under, or in connection with any discussions or
negotiations related to, the Capped Call Options, to the extent practicable,
prior to making any such response, and Lafite shall use its reasonable efforts
to promptly respond to any reasonable questions from, and reflect any
reasonable comments made by, Tempranillo or its counsel with respect thereto
prior to making any such response.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time and without limitation to the
other provisions of this _Section 6.04_, Lafite shall take all such actions
as may be required and may take any actions contemplated by the terms of the
applicable Capped Call Options, including the giving of any written notices
or communication in connection with the Merger and/or any conversions
and/or repurchases of the Convertible Notes or any adjustment to the
Conversion Rate (as defined in the Notes Indenture) thereunder or occurring
as a result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Tempranillo shall use its reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Lafite with respect to the foregoing upon reasonable request by Lafite.
Lafite shall use its reasonable efforts to provide Tempranillo and its
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such written
notice or communication prior to the dispatch or making thereof, and Lafite
shall use its reasonable efforts to promptly respond to any reasonable
questions from, and reflect any reasonable comments made by, Tempranillo or
its counsel with respect thereto prior to the dispatch or making thereof.

Section 6.05.   _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a)  Upon reasonable notice to Lafite, Lafite and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective officers,
directors, employees and other Representatives to, afford Tempranillo's

Tempranillo, during normal business hours throughout the Pre-Closing Period,
to their respective Representatives, officers, employees, properties, assets,
facilities, books, Contracts, Permits, records (including Tax Returns),
reports, correspondence and any other documents and information of Lafite and
its Subsidiaries (whether in physical or electronic form) and shall
furnish Tempranillo all financial, operating and other data and information,
in each case, as Tempranillo through its officers, employees or other
Representatives, may reasonably request; _provided_ however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Lafite and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to create any
financial, operating or other data and information, or any business plans,
forecasts, projections or other similar analyses, that Lafite does not prepare
in the ordinary course of its business outside the context of this Agreement
and the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Lafite nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to disclose any information to
Tempranillo to the extent Lafite determines, in its good faith judgment, such
disclosure (i) would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or work product
protection, (ii) would reasonably be expected to result in a loss of Trade
Secret protection, or (iii) would contravene or violate any Applicable Law;
_provided_ that Lafite shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege or (B) to develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Tempranillo and Lafite. With respect to all information provided to
Tempranillo or any of its Representatives by Lafite or any of its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions (including any information disclosed pursuant to this _Section
6.05_) Tempranillo shall comply with and shall instruct its Representatives
to comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b)  No information or knowledge obtained by Tempranillo
pursuant to _Section 6.02_, this _Section 6.05_ or otherwise shall affect
or be deemed to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, the conditions to the obligations of
the parties to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement or otherwise
prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Tempranillo hereunder, nor
shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be deemed to affect or
modify Tempranillo's reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements made by Lafite in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.06. _Special Dividend_. Subject to Applicable Law and the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article 9_

prior to the Effective Time and in connection with the Closing, Lafite shall
(a) declare and, immediately prior to the Effective Time, pay a cash dividend
per Share equal to $7.09 (the " _Special Dividend Per Share Amount_ ") to
holders of record of the issued and outstanding shares of Lafite Common Stock
as of a record date immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "

information that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in,
a Tempranillo Takeover Proposal, (B) promptly, and in any event within one
(1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement, request that each Person and
its Representatives (other than Tempranillo and its Representatives) that has,
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, executed a
confidentiality agreement or otherwise received non-public information about
Tempranillo from, or on behalf of, Tempranillo, in each case, in connection
with such Person's consideration of a Tempranillo Takeover Transaction, to
promptly return or destroy all non-public information furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of Tempranillo or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
date of this Agreement and (C) immediately terminate access by any Third
Party to any physical or electronic data room relating to any
potential Tempranillo Takeover Transaction. Tempranillo shall not modify,
amend or terminate, or waive, release or assign, any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which
Tempranillo or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to any Tempranillo
Takeover Proposal and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement;
_provided_  that Tempranillo shall be permitted on a confidential non-public
basis to release or waive any explicit or implicit standstill obligations
solely to the extent necessary to permit the relevant party thereto to submit
a Tempranillo Takeover Proposal to the Tempranillo Board on a confidential
non-public basis and solely to the extent the Tempranillo Board determines in
good faith that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
Tempranillo Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Tempranillo shall
provide written notice to Lafite of the waiver or release of any standstill
by Tempranillo within twenty-four (24) hours of such waiver or release,
including disclosure of the identities of the parties thereto and
circumstances relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is understood that any breach of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 7.02(a)_ by any Representative of Tempranillo (solely for this
purpose as if the restrictions on Tempranillo set forth in this _Section
7.02(a)_ applied directly to such Representatives) shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of this _Section 7.02(a)_ by Tempranillo.

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if prior to the receipt of the Requisite Tempranillo Vote
Tempranillo receives a _bona fide_ written unsolicited Tempranillo Takeover
Proposal (which Tempranillo Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this
Agreement and did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.02_), and the
Tempranillo Board determines in good faith, after consultation on a
confidential basis with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of national reputation, that such Tempranillo Takeover Proposal constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Tempranillo Superior Proposal,
then Tempranillo and its Representatives may, in each case subject to
compliance with _Section 7.02(e)_ and the other provisions of this
Agreement: (i) furnish any information with respect to Tempranillo and its
Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Tempranillo Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives and financing sources); _provided_ that (A) prior to
furnishing any such information, Tempranillo receives from such Third Party an
executed confidentiality agreement (1) containing terms that are, in the
aggregate, no less restrictive of the Third Party that is party to such
agreement and its Affiliates and Representatives than the terms set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement are to Lafite and its Affiliates
and Representatives, provided that such confidentiality agreement need not
contain a "standstill" provision or other provisions having a similar effect,
and (2) that does not restrict, in any manner, Tempranillo's ability to
consummate the Transactions or to comply with its disclosure obligations to
Lafite pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) any such non-public information so
furnished has been previously provided or Made Available to Lafite or is
concurrently provided or Made Available (including through the Tempranillo
Data Room) to Lafite or (ii) participate or engage in negotiations or
discussions with, and only with, the Third Party making such Tempranillo
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Tempranillo Takeover
Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood
that any breach of the restrictions on Tempranillo set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of Tempranillo (solely for this purpose as if
the restrictions on Tempranillo set forth in this _Section 7.02(b)_ applied
directly to such Representatives) shall be deemed to constitute a breach of
this _Section 7.02(b)_ by Tempranillo.

  



  

   

97

 



    



  

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.02_ (including
_Section 7.02(d), (e)_ and _(g)_ ), neither the Tempranillo Board nor any
committee thereof shall (or resolve or agree to) (i) (A) withhold or withdraw
(or modify, amend or qualify in a manner adverse to Lafite), or propose
publicly to withhold or withdraw (or modify, amend or qualify in a manner
adverse to Lafite), the Tempranillo Board Recommendation (or the
recommendation or declaration of advisability by any such committee of this
Agreement, the Tempranillo Charter Amendment or the Share Issuance), (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Tempranillo Takeover Proposal, (C) fail
to include the Tempranillo Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus when disseminated to Tempranillo's stockholders or (D)
resolve or agree to take any of the actions described in clauses (A)-(C) (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Tempranillo
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend, declare
advisable or cause or permit Tempranillo to enter into any Contract, letter
of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement constituting or with respect to, or which is
intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Tempranillo
Takeover Proposal, other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.02(b)_ (an " _Alternative Tempranillo Acquisition Agreement_ ").

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Tempranillo
Vote, the Tempranillo Board may make a Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Tempranillo Intervening Event if the Tempranillo
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation, that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the Tempranillo Board's fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, _only if_ all of the following conditions are
satisfied:

  



  

(i)  Tempranillo shall have first provided Lafite an
Intervening Event Notice at least five (5) Business Days in advance advising
Lafite that Tempranillo intends to make a Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation
Change (it being understood and hereby agreed that the delivery and receipt
of any such Intervening Event Notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to
be a Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change) and specifying, in reasonable
detail, the Tempranillo Intervening Event;

  



  

(ii)  during the applicable Intervening Event Notice Period (or
any mutually agreed extension or continuation thereof), Tempranillo and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Lafite and its officers,
directors and Representatives regarding any changes to the terms of this
Agreement and any other proposals made by Lafite so that a failure to effect a
Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Tempranillo
Intervening Event would no longer be inconsistent with the Tempranillo
Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;

  



  

(iii) Lafite does not make, within the applicable Intervening
Event Notice Period (or any extension or continuation thereof) after
the receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the good faith judgment
of the Tempranillo Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of national reputation), cause the failure to effect a
Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Tempranillo
Intervening Event to no longer be inconsistent with the Tempranillo Board's
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
material change in any event, occurrence or facts relating to such
Tempranillo Intervening Event shall require a new Intervening Event Notice
with a new Intervening Event Notice Period ending on the earlier of (x) the
day that is three (3) Business Days after such material change and (y) the
day that is ten (10) days prior to the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting); and

  



  

   

98

 



    



  

(iv)  following the Intervening Event Notice Period, the
Tempranillo Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national reputation) that the failure to effect a Tempranillo
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Tempranillo Intervening
Event continues to be inconsistent with the Tempranillo Board's fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Tempranillo Vote
if, in response to a _bona fide_ unsolicited written Tempranillo Takeover
Proposal made by a Third Party after the date of this Agreement which does
not arise from a breach of this _Section 7.02_ and has not been
withdrawn, the Tempranillo Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national reputation) that (1) such Tempranillo Takeover Proposal constitutes
a Tempranillo Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to make a Tempranillo
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Tempranillo
Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Tempranillo Board may
make a Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change, _only if_ , in either
such case, all of the following conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(i)  Tempranillo shall have first provided to Lafite a
Superior Proposal Notice at least five (5) Business Days in advance
advising Lafite that the Tempranillo Board is prepared to effect a
Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Tempranillo Superior Proposal (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
material terms and conditions of any such Tempranillo Superior
Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party making any such
Tempranillo Superior Proposal) (it being understood and hereby agreed that
the delivery and receipt of any such Superior Proposal Notice shall not, in
and of itself, be deemed to be a Lafite Adverse Recommendation Change) and
providing Lafite with a complete copy of any written request, proposal or
offer, including any proposed Alternative Tempranillo Acquisition Agreement
(and all schedules, appendices, exhibits and other attachments relating
thereto), and any other documents containing the material terms of such
Tempranillo Superior Proposal;

  



  

(ii)  during the applicable Superior Proposal Notice Period (or
any extension or continuation thereof), prior to its effecting a Tempranillo
Adverse Recommendation Change, Tempranillo and its Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Lafite and its officers, directors and
Representatives regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement and any other
proposals made by Lafite intended by Lafite to cause such Tempranillo
Takeover Proposal to no longer constitute a Tempranillo Superior Proposal;

  



  

(iii) Lafite does not make, within the applicable Superior
Proposal Notice Period (or any mutually agreed extension or
continuation thereof) after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that
would, in the good faith judgment of the Tempranillo Board
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national reputation), cause the offer previously constituting a Tempranillo
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Tempranillo Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment or modification of such
Tempranillo Superior Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal
Notice with a new Superior Proposal Notice Period of three (3) Business
Days);

  



  

   

99

 



    



  

(iv)  following the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the
Tempranillo Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national reputation) that, in light of such Tempranillo Superior Proposal and
taking into account any revised terms proposed by Lafite, (x) such Tempranillo
Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Tempranillo Superior Proposal,
and (y) the failure to make the Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change
would continue to be inconsistent with the Tempranillo Board's fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

  



  

(f)  In addition to the obligations of Tempranillo set forth in
paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this _Section 7.02_, Tempranillo
shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours following the receipt or delivery thereof, advise Lafite orally and in
writing of (i) any Tempranillo Takeover Proposal or any request for
information or inquiry that contemplates or that would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Tempranillo Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and
conditions of such Tempranillo Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry
(including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and
conditions) and the identity of the Person making any such Tempranillo
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any
notice referred to above, Tempranillo (or its outside counsel) shall (A) keep
Lafite (or its outside counsel) reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis regarding the status and terms of discussions and negotiations
relating to any such Tempranillo Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and
(B) Tempranillo shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours following the receipt or delivery thereof), provide
Lafite (or its outside legal counsel) with unredacted copies of all writings
or media (whether or not electronic) containing any terms or conditions of any
proposals or proposed transaction agreements (including any drafts thereof
and all schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any Tempranillo Takeover
Proposal.

  



  

(g)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
Tempranillo or the Tempranillo Board, directly or indirectly, through their
respective Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of Tempranillo any position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of Tempranillo that the Tempranillo Board
has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is required by Applicable Law; _provided_ that this
_Section 7.02(g)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Tempranillo Board to
make a Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent
permitted by _Section 7.02(d)_- _(e)_.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding (i) any Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation
Change, (ii) the making of any Tempranillo Takeover Proposal or (iii) anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, until the termination of this Agreement,
(x) in no event may Tempranillo or any of its Subsidiaries (A) enter into any
Contract, agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar instrument constituting or relating to
a Tempranillo Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.02(b)_), (B) except as required by Applicable
Law, make, facilitate or provide information in connection with any SEC or
other filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by any
Tempranillo Takeover Proposal or (C) seek any consents in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Tempranillo Takeover Proposal and (y)
Tempranillo shall otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations under
this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to hold
the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting.

Section 7.03.   _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, Tempranillo shall honor,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Lafite Employee Plans
in effect immediately before the Effective Time that by their terms provide a
contractual entitlement to any employee or service provider party to or
participating in such arrangements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein, other than _Section 7.03(b)_ and the terms of such arrangements,
including the contractual rights of such participants, shall prevent
Tempranillo from amending or terminating any Lafite Employee Plan or
providing compensation or benefits in its discretion.

  



  

(b)  For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time,
Tempranillo shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing
Employee who remains employed with the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of the Surviving Corporation (i) base salary and base wages and short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities that are, in each case, no less
favorable than those in effect for such Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other employee compensation and
benefits(excluding long-term incentive, equity and equity-based compensation
and deferred compensation) that, in each case, are substantially similar to
the employee compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee by
Lafite or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c)  From and after the Closing Date, with respect to Continuing
Employees, Tempranillo shall cause the service of each such Continuing
Employee with Lafite and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date to be
recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits,
benefit accruals (but not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility
under any defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement
medical benefits, subsidized early retirement benefits, or any other
similar benefits) and vesting under each Tempranillo Employee Plan in which
any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to
the extent that service was credited to such Continuing Employee for such
purposes under a comparable Lafite Employee Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date and to the extent that such credit would not result in a
duplication of benefits.

  



  

(d) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each
Tempranillo Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or
becomes eligible to participate, Tempranillo shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each such Tempranillo Employee Plan to waive all limitations
as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical
examinations and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable under such Tempranillo Employee Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Lafite Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his or her commencement of participation in
such Tempranillo Employee Plan.

  



  

   

101

 



    



  

(e)  Tempranillo, Lafite and the Surviving Corporation
acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section
7.03_ are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to this
Agreement and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any
Lafite Employee, any participant in any Lafite Employee Plan or Tempranillo
Employee Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment
with Tempranillo, Lafite, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 7.03_ shall be deemed to amend any
Lafite Employee Plan, any Tempranillo Employee Plan or to require
Tempranillo, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to permit
any Person to participate in any particular benefit plan sponsored or
maintained by Tempranillo or any of its Affiliates, or to continue or amend
any particular benefit plan, before or after the consummation of the
Transactions, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance
with its terms and Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 7.04.   _Obligations of Tempranillo_. Tempranillo shall cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions, including the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Tempranillo, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, shall approve and adopt this Agreement by written consent
immediately following its execution.

  



  

Section 7.05.   _Director and Officer Liability_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Tempranillo and
the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or manager of Lafite
or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer of Lafite
or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of Lafite or one
of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director or manager of another Person,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that Lafite would have been permitted to do so by law.
Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation from each of Tempranillo and the Surviving
Corporation within 90 days of receipt by Tempranillo or the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided
that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are to be advanced provides prior
to any receipt of such advances an undertaking, to the extent required by the
DGCL or other applicable law, to repay such advances if it is determined by a
final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination
is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing or any
other provision of this _Section 7.05_ , Tempranillo agrees that all rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of Lafite
and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any
indemnification or other agreements of Lafite as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and set forth in _Section 7.05 _of the Lafite Disclosure Letter
shall be assumed by Tempranillo and the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
jointly and severally, without further action, at the Effective Time, and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

  



  

   

102

 



    



  

(b)  From the Effective Time through the six (6)-year
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain, and the Tempranillo shall cause the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors and officers of Lafite and its
Subsidiaries than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Lafite as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Tempranillo shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, as of
the Effective Time, a "tail" insurance policy reasonably acceptable to
Lafite, with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance covering each person
currently covered by Lafite's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy of Lafite in
effect on the date of this Agreement (a " _Tail Policy_ "), which insurance
shall, prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six (6)-year
period; _provided_ that in no event shall Tempranillo or the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay, with respect to the entire six (6)-year
period following the Effective Time, premiums for insurance under this 
_Section 7.05(c)_ which in the aggregate exceed 300% of the aggregate premiums
paid by Lafite for the period in its most recent fiscal year for such purpose
(the " _Maximum Premium_ "); _provided_ further that Tempranillo shall
nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to the
entire six (6)-year period following the Effective Time, as may be
obtained for the Maximum Premium (including in the event any existing
insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six
(6)-year period).

  



  

(d)  In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Tempranillo shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.05_.

  



  

(e)  The provisions of this _Section 7.05_ (i) are intended to
be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party,
his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

  



  

   

103

 



    



  

Section 7.06.   _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice to Tempranillo, Tempranillo and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective officers, directors,
employees and other Representatives to, afford Lafite's officers and other
authorized Representatives access as requested by Lafite, during normal
business hours throughout the Pre-Closing Period, to their respective
Representatives, officers, employees, properties, assets, facilities, books,
Contracts, Permits, records (including Tax Returns), reports, correspondence
and any other documents and information of Tempranillo and its Subsidiaries
(whether in physical or electronic form) and shall furnish Lafite all
financial, operating and other data and information, in each case, as Lafite
through its officers, employees or other Representatives, may reasonably
request; _provided_ however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Tempranillo and its Subsidiaries
shall not be required to create any financial, operating or other data and
information, or any business plans, forecasts, projections or other
similar analyses, that Tempranillo does not prepare in the ordinary course of
its business outside the context of this Agreement and the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Tempranillo nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to disclose any information to Lafite to the extent
Tempranillo determines, in its good faith judgment, such disclosure (i) would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or work product protection, (ii)
would reasonably be expected to result in a loss of Trade Secret protection,
or (iii) would contravene or violate any Applicable Law; _provided_ that
Tempranillo shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-
client privilege or (B) to develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Lafite and Tempranillo. With respect to all information provided to Lafite or
any of its Representatives by Tempranillo or any of its Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions
(including any information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 7.06_ ) Lafite
shall comply with and shall instruct its Representatives to comply with, all
of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b)  No information or knowledge obtained by Lafite pursuant to
_Section 7.02_ , this _Section 7.06_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed
to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or otherwise prejudice in any way the
rights and remedies of Lafite hereunder, nor shall any such
information, knowledge or investigation be deemed to affect or modify
Lafite's reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made by Tempranillo in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.07. _Filing of Form S-8; Listing of Additional Shares_.
Tempranillo shall file no later than five (5) days after the Closing Date,
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to
the Tempranillo Common Stock issuable with respect to Lafite Stock Options,
Lafite Restricted Stock, Lafite RSUs and Lafite PSUs pursuant to _Section
2.06(a)_ , _Section 2.06(b)_ , _Section 2.06(c)_ or _Section 2.06(d)_ , as
applicable, and shall use its commercially best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as the Lafite Stock Options, Lafite Restricted Stock,
Lafite RSUs and Lafite PSUs remain outstanding. Tempranillo shall at times
ensure that there will remain a sufficient number of unissued shares of
Tempranillo Common Stock to meet its share issuance and settlement obligations
in connection with Lafite Stock Options, Lafite Restricted Stock, Lafite RSUs
and Lafite PSUs. Tempranillo shall take all action reasonably necessary
to cause the shares of Tempranillo Common Stock to be issuable with respect
to the Lafite Stock Options, Lafite Restricted Stock, Lafite RSUs and Lafite
PSUs, to be approved for listing on the NYSE at or prior to the Effective
Time.

Article 8

  



  

COVENANTS OF LAFITE AND TEMPRANILLO

  



  

Section 8.01.   _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share
acquisition," "business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other
anti-takeover Applicable Law may become or is deemed or purports to be
applicable to any Transaction, then each of Lafite, Tempranillo, Merger Sub
and their respective boards of directors shall take all such
actions necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
render such anti-takeover Applicable Law (or, in the case of Section 203 of
the DGCL, the restrictions on business combinations provided therein)
inapplicable to, or to minimize the effects of the foregoing on, the
Transactions.

  



  

Section 8.02.   _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the last sentence of _Section 8.02(d)_, Lafite and Tempranillo
shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) each use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to (i)
obtain all necessary actions, waivers, registrations,
permits, authorizations, orders, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities, the expiry or early termination of any applicable waiting
periods, and make all necessary registrations and filings (including filings
with Governmental Authorities, if any) and take all steps as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, in order to consummate
the Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the
End Date and (ii) deliver required notices or any necessary additional
instruments to, and obtain required consents, waivers or any additional
instruments necessary from, Third Parties in order to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the End
Date.

  



  

(b)  In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings
pursuant to this _Section 8.02_, each of Tempranillo and Lafite shall (i)
prepare and file any notification and report forms and related material
required under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws with
respect to the Transactions (if any), and any additional filings or
notifications and related material that are necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the Transactions, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
from the date of this Agreement for the filing of the notification and report
forms and related material required under the HSR Act), (ii) provide or cause
to be provided as promptly as reasonably practicable any information and
documentary material that may be requested by the DOJ or FTC under the HSR Act
or by other Governmental Authorities under applicable Antitrust Laws (if any)

prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or other

(c)   Subject to Applicable Law and the requirements of
applicable Governmental Authorities, Lafite and Tempranillo and
their respective counsel shall, in connection with efforts referenced in
_Section 8.02(a)_ and _Section 8.02(b)_, (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating
to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private person,
(ii) to the extent legally permissible, have the right to review in advance,
and each shall consult the other on, any material filing made with, or written
materials to be submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Transactions and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions, (iii) promptly inform each other of any material
communication (or any other material correspondence or memoranda) received
from, or given to, the DOJ or the FTC or any other applicable Governmental
Authority and (iv) where legally permissible, promptly furnish each
other with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
between them or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand, with
respect to the Transactions. In furtherance of the foregoing and subject to
Applicable Law and the requirements of Governmental Authorities, Lafite and
Tempranillo shall (with respect to any in-person discussion or meeting,
remote video meeting or substantive telephonic discussion or meeting), and
(with respect to any other telephonic discussion or meeting), provide the
other party and its counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to
participate in any material discussion or meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in
connection with the Transactions. Lafite and Tempranillo may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section 8.02_ as "Antitrust
Counsel Only Material." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 8.02_, materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of Lafite and its
Subsidiaries and as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other
privilege or confidentiality concerns.

  



  

(d) In furtherance of the undertakings of Tempranillo pursuant
to _Section 8.02(a)_ and _Section 8.02(b)_, Tempranillo and Lafite (if
requested by Tempranillo), along with their respective Subsidiaries, shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain clearance under any applicable
Antitrust Laws so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
End Date, which shall include using reasonable best efforts to propose,
negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition, license or other disposition
of such of its and its Subsidiaries' assets, properties or businesses or of
the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by Tempranillo pursuant
hereto, and enter into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable
in order to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order in any Proceeding by a
Governmental Authority or any other Person under Antitrust Laws that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transactions. Lafite shall not, unless requested to do so
by Tempranillo, commit to or effect any action contemplated in the
immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 8.02(d)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, in no event
shall Tempranillo or any of its Subsidiaries be required to take or agree to
(nor shall Lafite or any of its Subsidiaries be permitted to take or agree to
unless Tempranillo so directs them (and they shall, if Tempranillo so
directs, take or agree to, so long as such agreements are conditioned upon the
Closing)) any action, concession or undertaking (i) unless such action,
concession or undertaking is conditioned on the Closing or (ii) to the extent
it would constitute or result in, or would reasonably be expected to
constitute or result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Substantial
Detriment.

  



  

   

106

 



    



  

(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of _Section
8.02(d)_ or any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make
consummation of the Transactions hereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of the
Transactions, each of Lafite and Tempranillo shall use its reasonable best
efforts necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as
to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement unless, by mutual agreement, Lafite and
Tempranillo decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Each of Lafite or any of its Subsidiaries or Tempranillo or any of its
Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates shall not acquire (whether via
merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so
acquire, any assets of or any equity in any other Person or any business or
division thereof, or take any other action, if that action, acquisition or
agreement would reasonably be expected to (i) materially increase the risk of
not obtaining approval under the Antitrust Laws or the expiration or
termination of any waiting period in connection with the Antitrust Laws; (ii)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iii) prevent or materially delay (A)
receipt of approval under the Antitrust Laws or (B) the Registration Statement
being declared effective.

  



  

(f)  Each of Lafite and Tempranillo shall consult with the
other party and consider in good faith the views of the other party with
respect to the appropriate strategy relating to any matters relating to the
Antitrust Laws, including with respect to any filings, notifications,
submissions and communications with or to any Governmental Authority and the
nature and timing of any divestitures or other remedial undertakings made for
purposes of securing any required approvals under the Antitrust Laws;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to
the contrary, Tempranillo shall, on behalf of the parties, control and direct
all aspects of the parties' efforts with respect to the HSR Act and other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions, including having
principal responsibility for devising, implementing, and making the final
determination as to such appropriate strategy, and shall have the right, in
its sole discretion, to determine the nature and timing of any such
divestitures or other remedial undertakings to the extent any such
divestitures or other remedial undertakings would be conditioned upon
and only be effective after the Closing. Lafite shall cooperate in good faith
with Tempranillo and Merger Sub in the parties' efforts to obtain any
clearance, approval, waiver or expiry or early termination of any applicable
waiting periods with respect to any Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions this _Section 8.02(f)_ or any other provision of
this Agreement, Tempranillo shall not pull and re-file any notice under the
HSR Act, without the express prior approval of Lafite.

(a)  As promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement and in any event prior to August 31, 2020, (i) Lafite
and Tempranillo shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement

Meeting (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") in preliminary form, and (ii) Tempranillo
shall prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 which
shall include the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (together with all

relating to the registration of the shares of Tempranillo Common Stock to be
issued to the stockholders of Lafite pursuant to the Share Issuance. The
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement shall comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the

(b) Each of Lafite and Tempranillo shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC
as promptly as practicable after its filing, and Tempranillo shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective

the Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate
the Merger. Each of Lafite and Tempranillo shall, as promptly as practicable
after the receipt thereof, provide the other party with copies of any written
comments and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement received by
such party from the SEC, including any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement, and shall provide the other with copies of all material or
substantive correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing the Registration Statement or mailing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of Lafite and Tempranillo shall provide the other party and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and
consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with any
such document or response. None of Lafite, Tempranillo or their respective
Representatives shall agree to participate in any material or substantive
meeting or conference (including by telephone) with the SEC, or any member of
the staff thereof, in respect of the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by the SEC, allows the other party to
participate. Tempranillo shall advise Lafite, promptly after receipt
of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, and the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the
suspension of the qualification of shares of Tempranillo Common Stock for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of Lafite and Tempranillo
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order
or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of Lafite and
Tempranillo shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any other action
required to be taken by it under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange
Act, Delaware Law and the rules of the NYSE (solely in the case of
Tempranillo) and Nasdaq (solely in the case of Lafite) in connection with the
filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement, and the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders
of each of Lafite and Tempranillo thereunder. Subject to _Section 6.02_, the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Lafite Board
Recommendation, and, subject to _Section 7.02_, the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the Tempranillo Board
Recommendation.

  



  

   

108

 



    



  

(c)  Tempranillo shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Tempranillo Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date. Tempranillo shall cause (and Lafite shall
reasonably cooperate with Tempranillo to cause) Lafite's securities to be de-
listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time. Tempranillo shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "blue
sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ that in no event shall Tempranillo
be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified or file a general consent to service of process).

  



  

(d)  Each of Lafite and Tempranillo shall, upon request, furnish
to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and (to the extent reasonably available to the applicable party)
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Lafite, Tempranillo or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, to the SEC, the NYSE or Nasdaq in connection with the
Transactions, including the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. In addition, each of Lafite and Tempranillo shall use
its reasonable best efforts to provide information concerning it necessary to
enable Lafite and Tempranillo to prepare required pro forma financial
statements and related footnotes in connection with the preparation of the
Registration Statement and/or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

  



  

(e)  If at any time prior to the later of the receipt of the
Requisite Lafite Vote and the receipt of the Requisite Tempranillo Vote, any
information relating to Lafite or Tempranillo, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Lafite or
Tempranillo that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either
of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so
that either of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required under Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of
each of Lafite and Tempranillo.

the Lafite Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
and shall comply with all legal requirements applicable to the Lafite
Stockholders Meeting. Lafite shall not, without the prior written consent
of Tempranillo, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Lafite Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that Lafite may postpone or adjourn the
Lafite Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Lafite Board
has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is
necessary under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by Lafite's stockholders prior to the Lafite
Stockholders Meeting. If, on the date of the Lafite Stockholders Meeting,
(i) Tempranillo reasonably determines in good faith that Lafite has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Lafite Common
Stock to obtain the Requisite Lafite Vote or (ii) there is no quorum at the
Lafite Stockholders' Meeting, Lafite shall at its election or upon the
written request of Tempranillo adjourn the Lafite Stockholders Meeting until
such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by Lafite and Tempranillo, which
date shall be not less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days after
the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and conditions of

thereof at least twenty (20) Business Days prior thereto. As promptly as
practicable following the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, Tempranillo shall, in consultation with Lafite, in accordance with
Applicable Law and the Organizational Documents of Tempranillo, (i) duly call
and give notice of the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting, at which meeting
Tempranillo shall seek the Requisite Tempranillo Vote, (ii) cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus (and all other proxy materials for the Tempranillo
Stockholders Meeting) to be mailed to its stockholders and (iii) duly convene
and hold the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting. Subject to _Section 7.02_,
Tempranillo shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper
or advisable on its part to cause the Requisite Tempranillo Vote to be
received at the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, and shall comply with all legal requirements applicable
to the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting. Tempranillo shall not, without the
prior written consent of Lafite, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the
Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that Tempranillo
may postpone or adjourn the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the Tempranillo Board has determined in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under Applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed
by Tempranillo's stockholders prior to the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting.
If, on the date of the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting, (i) Lafite
reasonably determines in good faith that Tempranillo has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Tempranillo Common Stock to
obtain the Requisite Tempranillo Vote or (ii) there is no quorum at the
Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting, Tempranillo shall at its election or upon
the written request of Lafite adjourn the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting
until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by Lafite and Tempranillo,
which date shall be not less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days
after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including _Section 7.02_ ), shall continue to use its
reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to the Requisite
Tempranillo Vote. Tempranillo shall be required to adjourn the Tempranillo
Stockholders Meeting only one time pursuant to this _Section 8.04(b)_.

  



  

   

110

 



    



  

(c)   Each of Lafite and Tempranillo shall coordinate with the
other regarding the record date and the meeting date for the
Lafite Stockholders Meeting and the Tempranillo Stockholders Meeting, it
being the intention of Lafite and Tempranillo that the record date for each
such meeting of stockholders shall be the same.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding (i) any Lafite Adverse Recommendation
Change or Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the public proposal
or announcement or other submission to Lafite or any of its Representatives of
a Lafite Takeover Proposal or the public proposal or announcement or other
submission to Tempranillo or any of its Representatives of a Tempranillo
Takeover Proposal or (iii) anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of Lafite and Tempranillo under _Section 8.03_ and this _Section
8.04_ shall continue in full force and effect.

  



  

Section 8.05. _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be
in a form mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, and shall be issued as
promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement.
Tempranillo and Lafite shall consult with each other before issuing any other
press release, or scheduling a press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts, and shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with
each other before making any other public statement, in each case, with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such other public statement relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except
for any such release or announcement that Tempranillo or Lafite determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, is required by Applicable Law
or any listing agreement with or rule of any national or foreign
securities exchange or association upon which the securities of Lafite or
Tempranillo, as applicable, are listed, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall provide notice to and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with the other party about, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time (taking
into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement
in advance of such issuance, and the party will consider any such reasonable
comments that are timely provided in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 8.05_ shall prohibit or limit either party from (i)
making any public statement in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, making internal
announcements to employees and making disclosures in the Lafite SEC Documents
and the Tempranillo SEC Documents, as applicable, so long as such statements,
announcements and disclosures substantially reiterate (and are not
inconsistent with) previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements approved in advance by the other party, or (ii) making any
public statement, internal announcements to employees or disclosures in the
Lafite SEC Documents and the Tempranillo SEC Documents in respect of a Lafite
Adverse Recommendation Change or Tempranillo Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing proviso shall not in
any way effect any other prohibition or limitation contained in this
Agreement.

Section 8.06.   _Notice of Certain Events_.

  



  

(a)  Lafite, upon having Lafite's Knowledge, shall give prompt
notice to Tempranillo upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty
made by Lafite in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, or of any failure by Lafite to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to
the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Tempranillo and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 9.02_ to fail to
be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  Tempranillo, upon having Tempranillo's Knowledge, shall
give prompt notice to Lafite upon becoming aware that any representation or
warranty made by Tempranillo or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by Tempranillo or
Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by either pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth,
inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of Lafite to consummate the Merger set forth in
_Section 9.03_ to fail to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto)
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.07.   _Tax Treatment_.

  



  

(a) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and applicable state,
local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes), it is intended that (i) the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii)
with respect to the Merger, this Agreement will constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. Each of
Lafite and Tempranillo shall, and Tempranillo shall cause Merger Sub to, use
their respective reasonable best efforts and cooperate with one another and
Tax Opinion Counsel in order for (i) Lafite to obtain the Tax Opinion, and
(ii) any Tax opinions required to be filed with the SEC in connection with
the Registration Statement to be obtained. Each of Lafite and Tempranillo
shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Tax Opinion Counsel customary
representation letters, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Tax
Opinion Counsel, dated as of the Closing Date or such time or times as may
be reasonably requested by Tax Opinion Counsel.

  



  

   

112

 



    



  

(b)  Tempranillo shall reasonably promptly notify Lafite, and
Lafite shall reasonably promptly notify Tempranillo, in each case if such
party becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be
likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify for as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Code, including considering and negotiating in good faith such amendments
to this Agreement as may reasonably be required in order to obtain such
qualification (it being understood that no party shall be required to agree to
any such amendment which, in the good faith judgment of such party, would
subject it to any material economic, legal, regulatory, reputational or other
cost or detriment).

  



  

(c)  Lafite shall reasonably promptly notify Tempranillo if
Lafite becomes aware or any fact or circumstance indicating that Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP will not deliver the Tax Opinion. If Tax
Opinion Counsel will not deliver the Tax Opinion, Lafite and Tempranillo
shall cooperate and use good faith efforts to consider and negotiate such
amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in order for Tax
Opinion Counsel to deliver the Tax Opinion (it being understood that no party
shall be required to agree to any such amendment which, in the good faith
judgment of such party, would subject it to any material economic, legal,
regulatory, reputational or other cost or detriment).

  



  

(d)  The parties shall report the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, in a manner consistent with the treatment of the
Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Each of the parties shall file all of its tax returns, including
complying with the filing requirements of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-3, consistent with such treatment.

  



  

Section 8.08.   _Transaction Litigation_. Each of Lafite and Tempranillo
shall promptly notify the other in writing of any Transaction Litigation and
shall (a) give the other party at such participant's sole cost and expense the
right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made
by such party and shall discuss in advance any material discussions or
communications proposed to be held by such party with any third party in
connection with any such Transaction Litigation (and such party shall in good
faith take any comments or feedback provided by the other party into account),
and give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense and
settlement of, any such Transaction Litigation and (b) if the other party does
not exercise such right to participate, keep such other party reasonably and
promptly informed with respect to the status of such Transaction Litigation.
No compromise or full or partial settlement of any Transaction Litigation
shall be agreed to by either Lafite or Tempranillo without the other party's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Section 8.09. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Lafite
and Lafite Board (or a committee thereof consisting solely of two or
more non-employee directors, as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act), on the one hand, and Tempranillo and its board of directors (or a
committee thereof consisting solely of two or more non-employee directors, as
defined in Rule 16b-3, on the other hand under the Exchange Act), on the
other hand, shall take all actions to the extent necessary or as may be
reasonably requested by any party hereto in connection with this Agreement to
cause the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.06_ , any and all
dispositions or cancellations of equity securities of Lafite (including any
deemed dispositions or cancellations and any derivative securities with
respect to any equity securities of Lafite) held by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act

Tempranillo's Representatives, Affiliates and equityholders.

  



  

Section 11.06.   _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising
out of or related hereto or the Transactions or to the inducement of any
party hereto to enter into this Agreement (whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law statute or
otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
state.

  



  

   

123

 



    



  

Section 11.07.   _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably agree
(i) that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
and any state appellate court therefrom, or, if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the matter,
the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or the Federal District Court for
the District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate
courts therefrom and (ii) not to commence any such Proceeding in any court
except such courts. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, or
relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of
the Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not
be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees that notice or the
service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 11.01_ or in any other
manner permitted by Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 11.08.   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 11.08_.

  



  

Section 11.09.   _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other
remedy to which the parties are entitled at law or in equity, (a) the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches or threatened or
anticipated breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in the courts described in _Section 11.07_,
without proof of damages or otherwise, and (b) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither Lafite nor Tempranillo would have entered into this Agreement. Each
of the parties agrees that it waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
law and will not oppose the granting of an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 11.09_ shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

  



  

   

124

 



    



  

Section 11.10.   _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Merger and the other Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a holding, the parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in
order that the Merger and the other Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 11.11.   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the exhibits
and annexes to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Lafite Disclosure
Letter and the Tempranillo Disclosure Letter and any documents delivered by
the parties in connection herewith and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect thereto; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force
and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the
date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

  



  

Section 11.12.   _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout
all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that
it has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each
party and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties
shall be deemed the work product of all of the parties and may not be
construed against any party by reason of its drafting or preparation.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that
drafted or prepared it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived by
each of the parties hereto. Any matter set forth on the Lafite Disclosure
Letter or Tempranillo Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an
admission by Lafite or any of its Subsidiaries or Tempranillo or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or to otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material, is required to be disclosed by Lafite or Tempranillo, as
the case may be, under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum
thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement, nor shall be
construed as an admission or indication to any Third Party that any breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred.

  



  

Section 11.13.   _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto, it being understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign
the same counterpart. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
hereof signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to
this Agreement transmitted by electronic mail in PDF form, or by any other
electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document (including DocuSign), will be deemed to have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signatures.

Section 11.14.   _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document or
instrument delivered in connection herewith (other than any letter of
transmittal and the Voting Agreement), by its acceptance of the benefits of
this Agreement:

  



  

(a)  Tempranillo and Merger Sub each covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no persons other than Lafite have any
liabilities, obligations, commitments (whether known or unknown or whether
contingent or otherwise) hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that a
stockholder or and its affiliates or its respective managing members or
general partners may be partnerships or limited liability companies, neither
Tempranillo nor Merger Sub has any right of recovery under this Agreement, or
any claim based on such liabilities, obligations, commitments against, and no
personal liability shall attach to, any Non-Recourse Party of Lafite, through
Lafite or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Lafite against any
Non-Recourse Party of Lafite, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or law,
or otherwise; and

  



  

(b)  Lafite covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no persons
other than Tempranillo and Merger Sub have any liabilities,
obligations, commitments (whether known or unknown or whether contingent or
otherwise) hereunder, and that, Lafite does not have any right of recovery
under this Agreement, or any claim based on such liabilities, obligations,
commitments against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any Non-
Recourse Party of Tempranillo or Merger Sub, through Tempranillo or Merger Sub
or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim by or on behalf of Tempranillo or Merger Sub
against any Non-Recourse Party of Tempranillo or Merger Sub, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or law, or otherwise.
