capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.06. _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. At least one (1) Business Day prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint and enter into an exchange
agreement with a nationally-recognized paying agent reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the
Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price, the Series A-1 Offer Price or
the Series A-2 Offer Price for certificates representing Shares, Series A
Preferred Shares, Series A-1 Preferred Shares and Series A-2 Preferred Shares,
respectively (the " _Certificates_ "; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to include references to
effective affidavits of loss in accordance to _Section_ __ _ 2.13_ or to
book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares). Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall have deposited with the Paying Agent the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price, the Series A-1 Offer
Price and the Series A-2 Offer Price to be held in trust for the benefit of
the holders entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, Series A Offer
Price, Series A-1 Offer Price or Series A-2 Offer Price, as applicable, and
paid in respect of the Certificates (the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent
the amount of the Payment Fund is below the level required to make prompt
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration for Shares converted into the
right to receive such Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the
lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained
at a level sufficient to make such payments. Any investment of the Payment
Fund shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or
short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the
U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital

 



20

    

 exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). No such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to the former holder of Shares or Preferred
Shares pursuant to this _Article 2_. Promptly after the Effective Time and in
any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the
Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send,
to each record holder of Shares or Preferred Shares at the Effective Time, in
each case whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, the Series A Offer Price, the Series A-1 Offer Price or the
Series A-2 Offer Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_, a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery or
transfer of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent and the Company agree prior to the
consummation of the Offer) for use in such payment.

(b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a
Certificate and each holder of Preferred Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Series A Offer Price, the Series A-1 Offer Price or
the Series A-2 Offer Price, promptly upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent
of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Shares or Preferred Shares.
Until so surrendered or transferred, each such Certificate shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration or the Series A Offer Price, Series A-1 Offer Price or
the Series A-2 Offer Price, as applicable. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such
Certificate. The foregoing payments shall be made via check or wire transfer
of immediately available funds.

(c) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the
Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price, the Series A-1 Offer Price or
the Series A-2 Offer Price is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer tax required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
transfer tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) _No Other Rights_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares or Preferred Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and
book-entry shares that represented ownership of Shares or Preferred Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares or Preferred Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer, the holder of such Certificates shall be given a copy of a
letter of transmittal and instructed to comply with the instructions therein
in order to receive the Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price, the
Series A-1 Offer Price or the Series A-2 Offer Price, as applicable, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger.

 



21

    

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares or Preferred Shares twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for
the Merger Consideration or Preferred Shares for the Series A Offer Price,
the Series A-1 Offer Price or Series A-2 Offer Price, as applicable, in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof
for payment of the Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price, the Series
A-1 Offer Price or the Series A-2 Offer Price, as applicable.

 

Section 2.07. _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares cancelled in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.05(b)_) and held by a holder who is entitled to appraisal and who has
properly exercised appraisal rights for such Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be
treated as if they had been Shares converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.05(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate
formerly representing such Shares. The Company shall provide Parent prompt
written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares,
any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice and/or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or offer to
settle or settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.08. _Treatment of Equity Awards_ _; Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Option that is unvested shall become fully
vested, and each Company Option that is then outstanding shall, automatically
and without any action required on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder thereof to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash, equal to the product of (x) the total number of
Shares underlying the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
per-share exercise price of such Company Option (the " _Company Option
Payment_ "), less applicable Tax withholdings; provided, that each Company
Option with a per-share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled with no payment due the holder thereof. The
Company Option Payment shall be paid to 

 



22

    

 the applicable recipient as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days) following the Effective Time. Any Company Option
Payment shall be made through the regular payroll procedures.

(b) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that (i) no offering period under the Companys 2015
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_ ") shall be
commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (ii) no new participants
may join the offering period in existence under the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan on or after the date of this Agreement and (iii) no participant may
increase the amount of his or her salary deferrals with respect to such
offering period. In the event that the offering period under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement has not ended
on the date immediately preceding the Effective Time, then the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan and such offering period shall be terminated as of the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time, and all participant contributions
then in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be used to purchase Shares on
such date in accordance with the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as
if such date was the last day of such offering period. As of the Effective
Time, all Shares so purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be
treated identically to all other Shares with respect to the payment of
the Merger Consideration as set forth in _Article 2_. Effective no later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall have taken
corporate action to terminate the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company
will provide Parent with evidence that such action has been taken to
terminate the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective as of no later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, pursuant to resolutions of the
Company Board.

 

(c) _Termination of the Company_ __ _s Amended and Restated 2013 Stock
Incentive Plan_. Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, (i)
the Companys Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (including each
amended and/or restated version of such plan, the " _Incentive Plan_ ") shall
terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries
thereof shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company
shall ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in the Incentive
Plan or other plans, programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder
to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary thereof.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 2.08(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.08(b)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.08(c)_, it being understood and agreed that from and after the Effective
Time, no Company Option holder shall have any right with respect to any
Company Options other than to receive the payment, if any, provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.08_. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.08_.

 

Section 2.09. _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant
to purchase Shares or Preferred Shares (each, a " _Warrant_ ") that remains
unexercised and outstanding prior to the Closing, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and in full
consideration of such cancellation, will be converted into and thereafter
evidence the right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to
the product of (a) the

 



23

    

 aggregate number of Shares or Preferred Shares underlying such Warrant,
multiplied by (b) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per Share or
Preferred Share exercise price under such Warrant. _Section_ __ _ 2.09_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedules set forth, as of the close of business on the
Capitalization Date, (i) each Warrant, (ii) the number of Shares or Preferred
Shares issuable thereunder, (iii) the expiration date, (iv) the exercise
price or strike price (if any) relating thereto, (v) the grant date and (vi)
the applicable vesting schedule, the amount vested and outstanding and the
amount unvested and outstanding. For the avoidance of doubt, if the per share
exercise price under any Warrant is equal to or greater than the Offer Price,
such Warrant will be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment
therefor and will have no further force or effect.

Section 2.10. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of Shares
in connection with the exercise or settlement of Company Options, the issuance
of Shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan with respect to the offering
period in effect on the date of this Agreement (or the prior offering period)
or other issuances permitted by this Agreement), including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend, all references herein to specified numbers of shares affected
thereby, and any calculations that are based upon such numbers of
shares affected thereby, including the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall be
appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 2.11. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation (or any of its Subsidiaries) and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold Taxes from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold from such payment under any provision of any
applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation (or one of its Subsidiaries) or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and paid to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation (or its applicable Subsidiary) or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.12. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any

10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its conclusions about the

reasonably designed to ensure that (i) all material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time

principal executive officer of the Company and each former principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 promulgated under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Company SEC

Company and any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, on the other hand), including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act), where the result, purpose or effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the Company

 Proposal or (y) to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial

with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if at any time after the date hereof and prior to the consummation of the
Offer, the Company receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (which
Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
result from a material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_), the Company
and the Company Board and/or their Representatives may, subject to compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_, engage in negotiations or discussions

the date of this Agreement that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, the Company Board may make a
Change in Recommendation if the Company Board determines, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; provided, that the Company has provided Parent
four (4) Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that it intends
to take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for
such action.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
but subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_, at any time prior to the
consummation of the Offer if, in response to an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that did not result
from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may make a Change
in Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)(i)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_ to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_ unless (y) the
Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.02_, including to its obligations set forth in _Section_ __
_ 6.02(e)_, and (z) the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent, the
Termination Fee payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.04(b)_ substantially
concurrently with such termination.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company Board shall not make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_ and the Company shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _
6.02(d)_ unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent three (3)
Business Days prior written notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ")
advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action and specifying,
in reasonable detail, the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal and, if applicable and not prohibited by the terms of
any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement to which the Company is a
party as of the date hereof, providing a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreement (it being understood that, in the event of any change
in the per share consideration or form of consideration offered under, or any
other material amendment or modification of such Superior Proposal, the time
periods in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_ shall be extended by one (1)
additional Business Day) and (y):

(i) during such three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding
changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this
Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other
adjustments that may be irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent (the most
recent such adjustments, the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 5:00
p.m., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania time, on the on the third

 



60

    

 (3rd) Business Day of such three (3) Business Day period and shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor) that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if the Proposed Changed Terms were to be given
effect.

For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent, within four (4) Business Days
following its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice, makes an irrevocable
written offer that, as determined in good faith by the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) results in
the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal, then
the Company Board shall have no right to make a Change in Recommendation
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_ and the Company shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ or _Section_
__ _ 6.02(d)_ as a result of such Acquisition Proposal, unless such
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently determined by the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) to be a
Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_, in which case
_Section_ __ _ 6.02(e)_ shall apply to such determination.

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
advise Parent in writing in the event that the Company receives any
Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with such notice, if applicable,
provide to Parent the material terms and conditions (including, unless
prohibited by the terms of any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement
existing as of the date of this Agreement, the identity of the Person making
any such Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing of any material change to the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or any determination by the
Company Board pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ and (iii) provide to Parent
as soon as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt
or delivery thereof of any written indication of interest (or amendment
thereto) or any written material that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (or
amendment thereto) including copies of any proposed Alternative Acquisition
Agreements and any financing commitments related thereto.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (iii) the accurate disclosure of factual

the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto; provided, that in all
cases, no Change in Recommendation may be made unless the Company shall have

further, that no notification given by any party pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.05_ shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of the representations,

Section 6.06. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to all employees of the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall cause the service of
each such Continuing Employee with the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company Subsidiaries, the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation and all
of their respective predecessors to be recognized for purposes (other than for
purposes of service or benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan)
under each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Surviving
Corporation, the Parent or any of their respective Affiliates (collectively,
the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes
eligible to participate, except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits. Additionally, each Continuing Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under such Parent Benefit Plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Company Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
before the replacement. Without limiting the foregoing, each Continuing
Employee that was eligible to participate in the JetPay Corporation 401(k)
Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") immediately prior to the Closing Date
shall be eligible to participate, immediately following the Closing, in a
401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates.

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the Closing
Date, or if earlier, the date Continuing Employee terminates employment with
Parent or its Affiliates, Parent shall provide, or cause its Affiliates to
provide each Continuing Employee with (i) the hourly wage or base salary and
target cash bonus opportunity for each Continuing Employee that, in each
case, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect for
similar Company employees employed immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(ii) all other compensation and benefits (other than participation in a
defined benefit pension plan, stock purchase plan and equity plans) that are
at substantially comparable in the aggregate to such Continuing Employee as
those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, provided such Continuing Employees duties or employment status
as full-time or part-time do not change. In addition to, and without limiting,
the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_ in the event of
the termination of employment of any Continuing Employee during the twelve
(12) months immediately following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide such
Continuing Employee with severance payments and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the greater of the severance
payments and benefits Continuing Employee would have been entitled (i) under
the severance plan or policy

 



63

    

 of the Company or Company Subsidiary applicable to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) under the severance plans, agreements
or arrangements of Parent and its Affiliates, as amended from time to time
(excluding, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
in effect at the time of such Continuing Employees termination of employment.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_, from and
after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is an
"employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in which
any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive all limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements, required
physical examinations and other conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit
Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same
extent that such conditions, waiting periods, requirements and exclusions
would not have applied or would have been satisfied or waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee or
eligible dependent was a participant and (ii) credit all co-payments,
deductibles and other expenses paid by Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in the plan year in
which their participation in such plan ends and their participation in such
Parent Benefit Plan begins for purposes of satisfying any deductible, co-
payment, co-insurance and maximum-out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent
Benefit Plan.

 

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent will honor, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
terms as in effect on the Closing Date, all existing employment, retention,
incentive, change in control and severance agreements between the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and any Continuing Employee.

 

(e) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ are included for
the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not
create any right in any other Person, including any right to continued
employment or service with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ shall be deemed to (i) amend
any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or (ii) limit the right of
the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, merge or terminate any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement.

 

Section 6.07. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Merger or any other Transaction, then each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Boards of Directors shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and any other
Transaction contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Applicable Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and any other Transaction contemplated hereby.

 



64

    

Section 6.08. _Obligations of Parent_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, adopt or
publicly propose a plan of complete or partial liquidation, restructuring,
recapitalization or other reorganization, or resolutions providing for or
authorizing such a liquidation, dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization
or other reorganization that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede
or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions.

 

(c) Solely to the extent such action would reasonably be expected to
prevent or prohibit the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, (i) enter, or agree or commit to entrance, into
agreements with respect to, or consummate, any mergers or
business combinations, or any acquisition of any other Person or business or
(ii) make, or agree or commit to make, loans, advances or capital
contributions to, or investments in, any other Person.

 

Section 6.09. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain
officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time covering each such person
currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.09(a)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid
in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Current Premium_ ") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, cause to be
maintained policies of insurance that provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, in respect of the Transactions, and which it is hereby acknowledged
by Parent are permitted to be obtained by the Company at any time prior to the
Effective Time. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain such policies in full force and effect
for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to (i) each indemnification, exculpation, expense reimbursement or advance
agreement in effect between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
and any individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the

 



65

    

 Effective Time was, a director or officer of, or serving as a director or
officer of another Person at the request of, the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ", and each such indemnification
agreement, a " _D andO Indemnification Agreement_"), and (ii) any
indemnification, exculpation, expense reimbursement or advance provision and
any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company or other similar organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Governing
Document Indemnification Provisions_ "). For a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and
the Company Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement and advance of expenses of
directors and officers of the Company for periods at and prior to the
Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Organizational Documents of
the Company and such Company Subsidiaries. To the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
DandO Indemnification Agreements to continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the extent as provided in the DandO Indemnification
Agreement and Governing Document Indemnification Provisions, indemnify and
hold harmless each Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including
advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding arising out
of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or
alleged to have occurred whether before, at or after the Effective Time in
connection with such Indemnified Partys service as a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or acts or omissions in connection
with such Indemnified Partys service as officer, director, member, trustee or
other fiduciary in any other entity if such services were at the request, at
the direction or for the benefit of the Company); provided, that any Person to
whom any funds are advanced pursuant to the foregoing must provide an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
the indemnification of such Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the
event of any such Proceeding in which the Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification directly from Parent pursuant to this clause (c), Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall control the defense of any such Proceeding.

(d) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification
or advancement of expenses under this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ that is denied by
the Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such
indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Partys costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with pursuing his or her claims.

(e) If either of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_. 

 



66

    

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ shall
survive the Effective Time and shall thereafter not be terminated or amended
in any manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party.

 

Section 6.10. _Efforts_.

advisable under Applicable Laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including (i)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents,

all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, and (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions; provided that in no event shall the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Closing any fee, penalty
or other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required
for the consummation of the Transactions under any contract or agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other
in (i) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or
Governmental Consents are required to be obtained from, any Governmental
Authorities (including in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or
its Subsidiaries are operating any business) and (ii) to the extent not made
prior to the date hereof, timely making or causing to be made all such
applications and filings as reasonably determined by Parent and the Company
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the date hereof with respect to filings or submissions required under
the HSR Act). The filing fee required under the HSR Act shall be paid by
Parent. Each party shall supply as promptly as practicable such information,
documentation, other material or testimony that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority, including by complying at the earliest reasonably
practicable date with any request under or with respect to the HSR Act, any
other Governmental Consent and any such other Applicable Laws for additional
information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries from the FTC or the DOJ, or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with such applications or filings or the
Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the intent of extending
any waiting period or comparable period under any the HSR Act or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of
the Company.

 



67

    

(c) Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder, Parent and
Merger Sub shall take all such further action as may be necessary to resolve
such objections, if any, as the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, state
antitrust enforcement authorities, or competition authorities of any other
nation or other jurisdiction (including multinational or supranational), or
any other Person, may assert under any Applicable Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Applicable Law that may be asserted by any Person with
respect to the Merger, in each case so as to enable the Merger and the
Transactions to occur as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the
End Date), including by proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by agreement, consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, (x) the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets, businesses, services,
products or product lines of Parent or the Company (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) or behavioral limitations, conduct
restrictions or commitments with respect to any such assets, businesses,
services, products or product lines of Parent or the Company (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates), (y) the creation or termination of
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates and (z) any other
actions that would limit the freedom of action of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to, or its ability
to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Companys or
the Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates assets, businesses, services,
products or product lines, in each case as may be required in order to obtain
all required Governmental Consents as promptly as practicable (including
expirations or terminations of waiting periods whether imposed by Applicable
Law or agreement) and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or delaying any of the foregoing beyond the End Date (each of (x), (y) and
(z), a "Divestiture Action"). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior written consent, and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the Companys prior written
consent, discuss or commit to any extension of any waiting period under any
Applicable Law or any agreement not to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company shall be required to complete any Divestiture Action pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ unless it is expressly conditioned on the
effectiveness of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated
to propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, or otherwise agree to, by
agreement, consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise (i) to any
Divestiture Action which is not limited to the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) to any Divestiture Action involving the assets of the

_Section_ __ _ 6.10_, (ii) to furnish to the other such necessary information
and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any notifications or filings, (iii) to keep 

 



68

    

 each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated therein, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by such party from,
or given by such party to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Transactions, (iv) to permit the other party to review and
to incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any communication to
be given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining the
necessary approvals for the Transactions, and (v) not to participate in any
meeting or discussion in person or by telephone expected to address
substantive matters related to the transactions contemplated herein with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions unless, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, it gives the other
party reasonable notice thereof and the opportunity to attend and observe.
The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ in a manner so as to preserve any applicable privilege. Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section_
__ _ 6.10(d)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, except as
required by this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates shall not
engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any action to be
taken or transaction to be entered into, that would materially impair or
delay Parent or Merger Subs ability to consummate the Transactions or perform
their obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates shall
acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or
otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any amounts of assets of or any equity in
any other Person or any business or division thereof, unless that acquisition
or agreement would not reasonably be expected to (i) increase the risk of not
obtaining any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of
any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any
waiting period under the HSR Act or (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental
Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions

not been cured by the Company by the earlier of (1) 30 days after written
notice has been given to Parent by the Company of such breach or failure to
performance and (2) the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(iii)_

cured by Parent within thirty (30) Business Days after written notice has
been given by the Company to Parent of such breach or failure to perform;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_ if, at the time such

Company is in material breach of any provision of this Agreement; or

 

(iii) If Merger Sub fails to commence the Offer as provided in _Section_ __
_ 2.01(a)_ or consummate the Offer in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.01(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this

Section 9.03. _Amendments and Waivers_. Subject to Applicable Law and the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_:

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived at any time

in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case
of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) without the further approval of the

Agreement and (B) there shall be no waiver by the Company (including pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_) that would be adverse to the stockholders of the

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_, any failure
of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any
of the parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument
signed by each such party granting such waiver. No failure or delay by any
party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 9.04. _Fees; Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense.

of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement and (i) at any time on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly announced (and not publicly withdrawn) and (ii) (A) within

75

    

 after such twelve (12) month period), or (B) within twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, any Acquisition Transaction is consummated, then
the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee promptly, but in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after such consummation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.04(d)_, the term
"Acquisition Transaction" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
_Article 1_ except that the reference to "fifteen percent (15%)" therein shall
be deemed to be a reference to "fifty percent (50%)."

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_ shall be payable only once with respect to this

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that
without such provisions Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly provide to the Company upon request therefor
the wire transfer information required to make any payments pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee and

Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall
reimburse Parent and Merger Sub for their reasonable and documented, out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable outside attorneys fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit; provided that if Parent commences
such a suit which does not result in an Order against the Company for the
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Parent shall reimburse the Company
for its reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable outside attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit.

Fee is paid by the Company as required by this  _Section_ __ _ 9.04_,
Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee (as
applicable) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.04_ shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates and
Representatives against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of
their respective former, current or future Representatives, general or limited
partners, stockholders, members, managers, employees, Affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the " _Company-Related_ _Parties_ ") for all damages, costs,
fees, expenses, Liabilities, penalties or losses of any kind suffered as a
result of or in connection with this Agreement (including the negotiation,
execution, performance or breach thereof), the failure of the Transactions to

relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions under any
theory of law or equity, contract, tort or otherwise.

that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder.

 



76

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,

Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, and
permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement, except (i) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.09_
(DandO Coverage) and _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ (Survival) shall inure to the benefit
of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly intended to
be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants
contained therein, (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares shall be beneficiaries of the obligation to pay the
Merger Consideration or Offer Prices, as applicable, (iii) from and after the
acceptance of the Offer, the holders of Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn shall be beneficiaries of the obligation to pay the Company
Share Offer Price and the holders of Preferred Shares shall be beneficiaries
of the obligation to pay the Series A Offer Price, the Series A-1 Offer Price
and the Series A-2 Offer Price, as applicable, and (iv) from and after the
Effective Time, the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ (Treatment of Equity
Awards; Employee Stock Purchase Plan) shall inure to the benefit of those
entitled to the payments thereunder; notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall be entitled and have the right to pursue and recover damages in

Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement. 

Section 9.06. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising
out of or related hereto or to the Transactions or to the inducement of any
party hereto to enter into this Agreement, whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise (and whether predicated on common law, statute
or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, including all matters of construction, validity and
performance, without regard to the conflicts of law rules that would refer a
matter to the laws of another jurisdiction.

 

Section 9.07. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and
any state appellate court therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if
no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for
the District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate
court therefrom, or if such federal court does not have jurisdiction or
venue, any court of the State of Delaware having jurisdiction and venue. Each
party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court
in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions, or relating to enforcement of any of the
terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each
party agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be properly
served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section_ __ _
9.01_ or in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

Section 9.08. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING OR

 OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS,
OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 

Section 9.09. _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, except as expressly provided in the following sentence.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no such
state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court located in
Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom, and, in any action
for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto further agree
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.09_,
a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
9.09_ shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit
any partys right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.09_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_
restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of _Article 8_ or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available at any time. 

Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties
agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner,
in order that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Tender Agreements, the exhibits to this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure Schedules and any documents
delivered by the parties hereto in connection herewith constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and

78

    

Section 9.12. _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto

party hereto and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be deemed

it being understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. Until and unless each party hereto has received a counterpart
hereof signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to
this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in

_Exhibit A_

 

 _Conditions to the Offer_

 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer but subject to the terms set forth
in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Exchange Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to Merger Subs obligation to
pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer, if and only if:

 

(i) at the Offer Expiration Time (as extended in accordance with the Merger
Agreement), there shall not have been validly tendered and "received" (as
defined in Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL), and not validly withdrawn, prior to
the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares and Preferred Shares which,
together with the Shares and Preferred Shares otherwise owned by Merger Sub
or its Affiliates, equals a majority of the voting power of the issued and
outstanding Shares and Preferred Shares (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 

(ii) at the Offer Expiration Time, any applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated;

(iii) any of the following conditions shall exist at the time of Offer
Expiration Time:

 

(A) any Order issued by a Governmental Authority, or any Applicable Law
shall be in effect that would (1) make the Offer or the Merger illegal or (2)
otherwise prevent the consummation thereof;

(B) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth (1) _Section
4.01_ , _Section_ __ _ 4.03_, _Section_ __ _ 4.06(a)_ (to the extent such
provisions in _Section_ __ _ 4.06_ do not impact the aggregate consideration
payable under the Merger Agreement), _Section_ __ _ 4.29_ or _Section_ __ _
4.31_ of the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects,
except to the extent that any inaccuracies would be immaterial; (2) in
_Section_ __ _ 4.06_ (to the extent such provisions in _Section_ __ _ 4.06_
impact the aggregate consideration payable under the Merger Agreement) of the
Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects, except to the
extent that any inaccuracies would be _de minimis_ ; (3) in _Section_ __ _
4.11(b)_ (No Company Material Adverse Effect) of the Merger Agreement shall
not be true and correct in all respects, and/or (4) each other representation
and warranty of the Company set forth in the Merger Agreement shall not be
true and correct in all respects (after disregarding any qualifications that
reference material, materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect) except to
the extent that any inaccuracies in such representation or warranty would not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, in the case of clauses (B)(1),
(B)(2), (B)(3) and (B)(4), as if such representations and warranties were made
on and as of the Offer Expiration Time (or, in the case of such
representations and warranties made only as of a specified time or date, on
and as of such specified time or date);

the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or
covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the
Merger Agreement prior to such time;

 



A-1

    

(C) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a
certificate signed by a senior executive officer of the Company dated the
date on which the Offer expires certifying that the conditions specified in
clauses (B) and (C) of this paragraph (iii) do not exist; or;

 

(D) a Data Compromise occurring or that is discovered after the date hereof
involving more than 7,000,000 Cards and causing at least $7,000,000 of direct
damages; or

(iv) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

The foregoing conditions set forth in clause (iii) above are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion
of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in each case to the terms of the
Merger Agreement and Applicable Law. The foregoing conditions set forth in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) may not be waived without the prior written consent
of the Company. Any reference in this Exhibit A or in the Merger Agreement to
a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such
condition or requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in
addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to
extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the agreement to which it is attached, except that
the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the agreement to
which this Exhibit A is attached.

avoidance of doubt, (x) the Stockholder shall not be required, for purposes of
this Agreement, to exercise any unexercised Company equity award held by the
Stockholder and (y) the Stockholder shall not have any obligation under this
_Section_ __ _ 3_ to tender (or caused to be tendered) any Subject Shares

- (e) of the SPA shall not apply to, and hereby waives its rights (including
rights to receive notice) under such provisions with respect to, the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Offer).
Solely for the benefit of the Stockholder (and not Parent or Merger Sub), the
Company shall not agree to or give any modification, consent, waiver or
amendment to or under any provision of the Merger Agreement that would be
adverse to the Stockholder (including if such modification, consent, waiver
or amendment that would reduce the amount, change the form or otherwise
adversely affect the consideration payable to the Stockholder pursuant to the
Offer or the Merger Agreement) without the prior written consent of the Series
A Preferred Majority Holders (as defined in the Series A Certificate of
Designation). 

---|--- 

4. _Directors and Officers_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall (or shall require the Stockholder to attempt to) limit or restrict the Stockholder in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any designee of, or Person affiliated with, the Stockholder who is a director or officer of the Company from acting in such capacity or voting in such persons sole discretion on any matter (it being understood that this Agreement shall apply to the Stockholder solely in the Stockholders capacity as a stockholder of the Company and that any director or officer of the Company who signs this Agreement on behalf of the Stockholder is signing only as an individual and not in any other capacity). No action (or inaction) taken by the Stockholder or any designee of, or Person affiliated with, the Stockholder who is a director or officer of the Company in their capacity as a director or officer of the Company shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement. 

5. _Trustees_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall (or shall require the Stockholder to attempt to) limit or restrict any trustee of the Stockholder in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company from acting in such capacity or voting in such persons sole discretion on any matter (it being understood that this Agreement shall apply to the Stockholder solely in the Stockholders capacity as a stockholder 

   

 of the Company and that any trustee who signs this Agreement on behalf of
the Stockholder is signing only in his or her capacity as a trustee and not as
an individual or in any other capacity). No action (or inaction) taken by any
trustee in their capacity as a director or officer of the Company shall be
deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.

 

6. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Subject Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have the authority by virtue of this Agreement or the transactions to be consummated pursuant hereto to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct the Stockholder in the voting of any of the Subject Shares to the extent such Subject Shares are entitled to be voted, except as otherwise provided herein.

The Stockholder shall permit the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to publish and disclose (in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure document that the Company, Parent or Merger Sub determines to be necessary or desirable in connection with the Offer, the Merger and any transactions related thereto) the Stockholders identity and ownership of Subject Shares and the nature of the commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Expiration Date, nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11_ shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any Intentional and Knowing Breach of this Agreement that is material prior to such termination. 

12. _Miscellaneous Provisions_. 



     | (a) |

_Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement (other than _Section_ __ _ 3(c)_
and the following sentence) may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects by written agreement signed by Parent and the Stockholder. _Section_
__ _ 3(c)_ and this sentence may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects by written agreement signed by the Company and the Stockholder;
provided, however, that any amendments to this sentence adversely affecting
Parent or Merger Sub shall require the written consent of Parent. 

---|---|--- 
        | (b) |

_Extension of Time, Waiver, etc_. Any party may, subject to Applicable Law,
solely as to itself: (i) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party hereto; (ii) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (iii) waive
compliance by any other party with any of the agreements contained in this
Agreement or, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, waive any of
such partys conditions set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Stockholder, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or further
exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

_Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement. Except for the rights of the other parties to the
SPA in _Section_ __ _ 3(c)_ and the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9_,
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights
or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns or to otherwise create any third-party
beneficiary hereto. This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until (i)
the Company Board has voted to approve the Merger Agreement, (ii) the Merger
Agreement is executed by all the parties thereto, and (iii) this Agreement is
executed by all the parties hereto. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

_Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws. All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement,
shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such court
(and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court therefrom), in
any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The
consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall
have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall
not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto.
The parties agree that service of any court paper may be made in any manner
as may be provided under the applicable Laws or court rules governing service
of process in such court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT.  

---|---|--- 
        | (e) |

_Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached, and that the party seeking to
enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement
shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and
other equitable relief. The parties hereto further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) |

_Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of the Stockholder,
but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations
under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

     | (h) |

_Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term
or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or  

---|---|--- 
        |  provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that
will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.  
---|--- 



     | (i) |

_Construction_. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | a. |

For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: (A) the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; (B) the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; (C) the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and (D) the neuter gender
shall include the masculine and feminine genders. 

---|---|--- 



     | b. |

The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | c. |

As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations
thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

---|---|--- 



     | (j) |

_Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (k) |

_Counterparts; Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format"
(".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, or by combination of
such means, each of which shall be deemed an original. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (l) |

_No Recourse_. Parent and Merger Sub agree that the Stockholder (in his
capacity as a stockholder of the Company) will not be liable for claims,
losses, damages, liabilities or other obligations resulting from the Companys
breach of the Merger Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (m) |

_Expenses_. Without duplication of the Companys obligations under Section
12.1 of the SPA, Parent shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Stockholder (including the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel for the Stockholder) related to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including related to any filings under
the HSR Act) and/or this Agreement and/or the preparation, negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and any amendments or waivers hereto, in an amount not to exceed $[●].
For the avoidance of doubt, 

---|---|--- 
        |  Parents payment of expenses of the Stockholder under this
_Section_ __ _ 12(m)_ shall constitute full satisfaction of the Companys
obligations to the Stockholder under Section 12.1 of the SPA with respect to
expense reimbursement in connection with the Merger Agreement, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, each party shall bear its own expenses in
connection with this Agreement. 
---|--- 



     | (n) |

_Indemnification_. 

---|---|--- 
 

(i) Parent (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") covenants and agrees, on the
terms and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, to
indemnify and hold harmless Stockholder and Stockholders representatives
(each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), from and against any and all Losses
incurred in connection with, arising out of or resulting from any claims,
demands, actions, proceedings or investigations (collectively, " _Actions_ ")
relating solely to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
this Agreement (including any Actions brought by any of the stockholders,
directors, officers or employees of any of Parent or Company relating
thereto). For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 12(n)_, " _Losses_ " means any
direct loss, liability, cost, damage or expense (including, without
duplication, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants
and other experts) related to an Action for which an Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying
Party will not be obligated to provide indemnity hereunder to any Indemnified
Party with respect to any Losses which (x) result from such Indemnified
Partys willful misconduct or gross negligence, (y) result primarily from any
breach of any representation and warranty of such Indemnified Party contained
in this Agreement or any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by such Indemnified Party under this Agreement or (z) constitute
consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or enhanced
damages or lost profits.

(iii) The Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12(n)_ regardless of whether such Losses are
incurred prior to or after the Closing (provided, however, that such
indemnification shall only be available in the instance of Losses relating to,
incurred in connection with, arising out of or resulting from any Actions
relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this
Agreement). The indemnification provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
12(n)_ is in addition to, and not in derogation of, and shall not supersede
or modify, any other rights an Indemnified Party may have under applicable
law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or pursuant to
any contract, agreement or arrangement; provided, however, that Losses will
not be duplicated.

(iv) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, in its sole discretion,
to defend against, negotiate, settle, or otherwise deal with any third party
Action that is or may be subject to indemnification hereunder (each an "
_Indemnifiable Claim_ ") (provided that the Indemnifying Party delivers a
written confirmation to the

   

 Indemnified Party that the indemnification provisions of _Section_ __ _
12(n)_ are applicable to such Indemnifiable Claim and that the Indemnifying
Party will indemnify such Indemnified Party in respect of such Indemnifiable
Claim to the extent required by this _Section_ __ _ 12(n)_) and the
Indemnified Party may participate, at his, her or its own expense, in the
defense of such Indemnifiable Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any such
Indemnifiable Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate,
settle, or otherwise deal with such Indemnifiable Claim, at the Indemnifying
Partys expense. Without the prior written consent of each of the Indemnified
Parties who are named in the Action subject to the Indemnifiable Claim (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the
Indemnifying Party will not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of
judgment with respect to any Indemnifiable Claim (or part thereof) unless such
settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Parties, (y) does not include any admission of wrongdoing on
the part of such Indemnified Parties and (z) does not require such Indemnified
Parties to pay any amount or suffer any loss and does not enjoin or restrict
in any way the future actions or conduct of such Indemnified Parties.
