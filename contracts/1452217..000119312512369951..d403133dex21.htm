vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated August 24,
2012, is by and among TPC Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), Sawgrass Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and
Sawgrass Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and
the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders
to consummate the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger (the " _Merger_
"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and have
each approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger.

WHEREAS, the Company Board and the respective boards of directors of Parent
and Merger Sub have each unanimously (in the case of the Company Board, with
two members abstaining) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Merger, whereby, except as expressly provided in Article 3, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Share_ "
or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
entered into voting agreements, each dated as of the date hereof, with certain
directors, members of senior management and stockholders of the Company
(collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, subject to
the terms thereof, the parties thereto have agreed, among other things, to
vote the Shares held by them in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this
Agreement, each of FR XII Alpha AIV, L.P., FR XII-A Alpha AIV, L.P. and SK
Capital Partners III, L.P. (collectively, the " _Guarantors_ ") is entering
into a limited guaranty in favor of the Company (collectively, the " _Limited
Guaranties_ ") pursuant to which the Guarantors are guaranteeing certain
obligations of each of Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger._

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as
the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by causing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and
shall make all other filings, recordings or publications required under the
DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the
time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL,
or at such later time or date as the parties shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with Applicable Laws (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

Section 1.2 _The Closing_. Subject to Article 7, unless otherwise
mutually agreed in writing between the Company and Parent, the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Baker Botts
L.L.P., One Shell Plaza, 910 Louisiana, Houston, Texas 77002, at 9:00 a.m.,
local time, no later than the second business day following the day on which
the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article 7
shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7
(other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), then the
Closing shall occur instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of (A) any business day before
or during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than
two business days prior written notice to the Company, and (B) the business
day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period. The date on
which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

" _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein, by the Charter or
by Applicable Laws (subject to Section 6.10(f)).

Section 2.3 _Board of Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub, as of the
Effective Time, shall, and the parties hereto shall take, and cause to be

Bylaws.

 

Section 2.4 _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time

ARTICLE 3

EFFECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any capital stock of the Company:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined below),
and (iii) Shares owned by the

 



3  Company in treasury or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company (each Share referred to in clause (i) through (iii) above being an
" _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be
converted into the right to receive $40.00 in cash (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 3.1 shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of such
Shares formerly represented thereby, without interest.

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Except as provided in the second sentence
of this Section 3.1(b), each Excluded Share, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be automatically canceled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the
Record Holders of any Dissenting Shares to demand appraisal with respect to
such Dissenting Shares or to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by Section 3.2(f). Each Excluded Share that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall remain
outstanding, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. As used in this Article 3, the term " _Record Holder_ " means, with
respect to any Shares, a Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the holder of record of such Shares.

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 3.2  _Payment_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a paying
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the
stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a).
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). If a Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its
demand for, or loses its, appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall make available or
cause to be made available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the number of Dissenting Shares for which the
Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its, appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the Per Share Merger
Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_  that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors 

 



4  Financial Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $750 million, or in money market funds having a rating in the
highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at
the time of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the aggregate amounts payable under Section 3.1(a) shall be promptly
returned to Parent (or its designee). To the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash
payment under Section 3.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such aggregate payments under Section
3.1(a).

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
third business day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each Record Holder, as of the Effective Time, of
an outstanding Certificate or outstanding Certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, which have converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect
thereto, a form of letter of transmittal in customary form and
reasonable instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and such
Certificate shall then be canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the third business day following the Effective Time
(or, solely if delivery of a letter of transmittal (which letter of
transmittal shall be in customary form and shall have such provisions as the
Company and Parent may reasonably agree) by each Record Holder of Book-Entry
Shares is required by the Paying Agent, promptly following the Paying Agents
receipt of such letter of transmittal), the Paying Agent shall issue and
deliver to each Record Holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") a check or wire transfer for the amount of
cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of
this Agreement in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, and such Book-Entry
Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Per Share
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, or if payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall
be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any

 



5  transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the Paying Agent that such tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.2(b), each Certificate (other than with respect to Excluded Shares)
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article 3\.

 

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
(" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 10:30 a.m.
(Houston time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the number of Shares other than Excluded Shares held of record
by DTC or such nominee as of the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share
Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the
Closing occurs after 10:30 a.m. (Houston time) on the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first business day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
DTC Payment.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Person presents to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying Agent any
Certificates for transfer or any transfer instructions relating to Shares
canceled in the Merger, such Person shall be given a copy of the letter of
transmittal referred to in Section 3.2(b)(i) and told to comply with the
instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive any cash to
which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Article 3\.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of Shares for nine months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation (or its designee). Any Record Holder
of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) only as a general
creditor thereof for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration for such
Shares upon compliance with the instructions in the form of letter of
transmittal referred to in Section 3.2(b)(i), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Record Holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. All cash paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
Authority or other entity of any kind or nature.

 



6 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with
customary replacement requirements reasonably established by the Paying Agent,
including the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may reasonably be required by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will deliver the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant
to this Article 3.

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled only to such rights
as are accorded under Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost its right to appraisal under the DGCL. If
any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such
Share, in accordance with Section 3.1, without interest. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals
of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Applicable Laws
that are received by the Company relating to Company stockholders rights of
appraisal. Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal by Company stockholders
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled, without duplication, to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of
Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other
applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (i) timely remitted by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the

 



7  Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and
(ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Record Holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be.

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) _Options and SARs_. Except as otherwise agreed after the date of this
Agreement by Parent and a holder of Company Options or Company SARs (each as
defined below), as of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares (a "
_Company Option_ ") and each stock appreciation right (a " _Company SAR_ ")
granted under the TPC Group Inc. 2004 Stock Award Plan and the TPC Group Inc.
2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), which, in
each case, is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable and, at
the Effective Time, shall be canceled by the Company and converted into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay), promptly following the Effective Time (but in
no event later than the third business day following the Effective Time), in
consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to (i) the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company Option or
Company SAR, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time _times_
(y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price or grant price, as applicable, per Share under such Company
Option or Company SAR, as applicable, less (ii) any amounts required to be
withheld or deducted with respect to such payment and without interest. In
the event that the exercise price or grant price of any Company Option or
Company SAR, as applicable, is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Company Option or Company SAR, as applicable, shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and have no
further force or effect.

(b) _Restricted Stock_. Each Share granted subject to vesting or other lapse
restrictions pursuant to any Stock Plan (a " _Restricted Share_ ") which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
and no longer subject to such restrictions as of the Effective Time and as a
result shall be considered a Share for purposes of Section 3.1.

(c)  _Restricted Stock Units_. Except as otherwise agreed after the date of
this Agreement by Parent and a holder of Company RSUs (as defined below), each
restricted stock unit granted under a Stock Plan (a " _Company RSU_ "), which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
vested, shall become fully vested and, at the Effective Time, shall be
canceled by the Company and converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay), promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than the
third business day following the Effective Time), in consideration for such
cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number
of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
_times_ (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any amounts required to
be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment and without interest.

 



8 (d) _Performance Share Units_. Each performance share unit granted under a
Stock Plan (a " _Company PSU_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, to the extent not already vested, shall become vested, if
at all, with respect to the number of Shares to which the holder of such
Company PSU is entitled in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Stock Plan and award agreement governing such Company PSU as in
effect at the Effective Time, and any such vested Company PSU, if any, which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled by
the Company and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay),
promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than the third
business day following the Effective Time), in consideration for such
cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of such
vested Shares, if any, subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time _times_ (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any
amounts required to be withheld with respect to such payment and without
interest. In addition to the foregoing, the number of additional Company PSUs
that would have become vested as of the Effective Time in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Stock Plan and award agreement
governing such Company PSUs as in effect at the Effective Time in the absence
of the application of the proration provision of the applicable award
agreement (such Company PSUs, the "Additional Company PSUs"), if any, shall be
canceled by the Company and the holders of such Additional Company PSUs shall
become entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay), promptly following the Effective Time
(but in no event later than the third business day following the Effective
Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares, if
any, subject to the Additional Company PSUs immediately prior to the Effective
Time _times_ (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any amounts required
to be withheld with respect to such payment and without interest; provided,
that payment of 50% of the after-tax amount payable to any such holder of
Additional Company PSUs (the "Investment Amount") shall be conditioned on such
holders agreement to use the Investment Amount to acquire equity securities
of Parent or an Affiliate pursuant to the terms of a subscription agreement,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and provided to such
holder prior to the Effective Time, on pricing terms consistent with the
Equity Commitment Letters. If such holder does not agree in writing prior to
the Effective Time to use the Investment Amount to acquire equity securities
of Parent or an Affiliate, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the corresponding Additional Company PSUs shall be cancelled as of
the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no further force or
effect.

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall
take all actions necessary in order to implement the provisions of this
Section 3.3.

Section 3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



9 Section 3.5 _Rule 16b-3 Approval_. Prior to the Closing, the Company and
the Company Board or a committee thereof, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all actions to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ ") by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ") to be exempt from
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act in accordance with the procedures set forth in such Rule 16b-3.

 

ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as (i) set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent and
Merger Sub by the Company at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
" _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular
sections or subsection of this Agreement ( _provided_ that any information set
forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof where its
relevance to such other section is reasonably apparent) or (ii) disclosed or
included in the Company Reports filed with, or furnished to, the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") by the Company since
January 1, 2012 and publicly available prior to the date hereof and only as
and to the extent disclosed or included therein (excluding, in each case, any
disclosures set forth in any "risk factor" section, in any section relating
to forward-looking statements and any other disclosures included therein, in
each case to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature) (it being acknowledged that this clause (ii) shall not
apply to Sections 4.3, 4.9(i) and the second sentence of Section 4.7(a)), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

Section 4.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly qualified to do business
and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which
the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, does not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company has
heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of the Companys certificate of incorporation (the "
_Company Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") as in effect on
the date hereof. The Company Charter and the Company Bylaws are in full force
and effect.

 

Section 4.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. The Company
has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this

 



10  Agreement and the Voting Agreements and, upon receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution of this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the consummation by the Company of
the Transactions have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
on behalf of the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Voting
Agreements or to consummate the Transactions other than, with respect to the
Merger, the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement and the Voting Agreements. Assuming
this Agreement and the Voting Agreements have been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement and the Voting
Agreements constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors
rights, general principles of equity and any implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing.

Section 4.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 25,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $ 0.01 per
share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "). As of August 23, 2012 (the "
_Measurement Date_ "): (i) 15,854,503 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding (of which an aggregate of 9,342 were Restricted
Shares); (ii) 177,345 shares of Company Common Stock were held in treasury;
(iii) an aggregate of 5,000 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding Company Options; (iv) an aggregate of
up to 103,774 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon
exercise of outstanding Company SARs; (v) there were outstanding Company RSUs
that could be settled in up to 102,641 shares of Company Common Stock; and
(vi) there were outstanding Company PSUs that could be settled in up to
311,058 shares of Company Common Stock. All issued and outstanding Shares are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. As of the Measurement Date, except for this Agreement and as set
forth above, (i) there are no outstanding (A) shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company, (B) securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
Company or (C) options, warrants, calls or other rights to acquire from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or commitments which obligate the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, sell or register, any shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the Company (the items in clauses
(A), (B) and (C) are referred to collectively as " _Company Securities_ "),
and (ii) there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
Company Securities or to provide a material amount of funds to, or make any
material investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise)
in, or guarantee or provide a credit enhancement to, any Person. The Company
has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders
of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company
on any matter. All Company Options and Company SARs have been granted having
an exercise price or grant price, as applicable, per Share at least equal to
the fair market value of one Share on the date of grant of such Company Option
or Company SAR. From the Measurement Date to the date of this Agreement, no
shares of Company Common Stock have been issued.

 



11 Section 4.4 _Subsidiaries_. A true, complete and correct list of all of
the Subsidiaries of the Company is set forth in Exhibit 21.1 to the Companys
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. Each
of the Companys Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent such
concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,
has the corporate or other entity power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such
concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good
standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the transaction of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, does
not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in each of the
Companys Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by Applicable
Laws), and are owned by the Company or another wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company free and clear of all mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security
interests, pledges, leases, conditional sale contracts, charges, privileges,
easements, rights of way, reservations, options, rights of first refusal and
other encumbrances (" _Liens_ ") other than Permitted Liens. Except for the
capital stock of its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own any capital stock
or other equity or voting interest in any Person.

Section 4.5 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except for such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, do not constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect:

(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is, and since
January 1, 2010 none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been, in
violation of any applicable law, rule, regulation, code, governmental
determination, order, decree, judgment, treaty or convention, U.S. or non-U.S.
(collectively, " _Applicable Laws_ "), and no claim, investigation or
proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with
respect to any such matters.

(b) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company hold all permits,
licenses, certifications, variations, exemptions, orders, franchises and
approvals of all governmental or regulatory entities necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses (the " _Company Permits_ "). All
Company Permits are in full force and effect, and there exists no default
thereunder or breach thereof, and none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has notice or actual knowledge that such Company Permits will not
be renewed in the ordinary course after the Effective Time. No Governmental
Authority has given notice to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it
has taken or intends to take any action to terminate, suspend, cancel or
reform any Company Permit.

 

(c) Section 4.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of all material real property owned, leased, subleased or
otherwise occupied by the

 



12  Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Real Property_ "). The
Company and its Subsidiaries possess all permits, deeds, leases, licenses,
easements, rights of way, surface rights, operating authorities, orders,
exemptions, franchises, variances, consents, approvals and such other similar
agreements granting rights in real property or other authorizations (" _Real
Property Agreements_ ") required for the present ownership and operation of
all Company Real Property. The Company or the applicable Subsidiary has good,
valid and marketable fee title to all Company Real Property owned in fee,

(or such entities as indicated therein) as of the dates and for the periods
set forth therein (in each case subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to (x) such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y)

Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations other than liabilities or
obligations (i) arising under this Agreement and the Transactions, (ii)

(b) Since January 24, 2010, the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company have made all certifications (without qualification or
exceptions to the matters certified) required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of

the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
in connection with the filing of the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q

arranged for disposal of any Hazardous Materials, in each case, that would
reasonably be expected to result in liability to the Company under any
Environmental Law; (f) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
entered into any consent decree or other agreement with any Governmental
Authority, and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is subject to any
judgment, decree, order or similar requirement, in either case relating to any
Environmental Laws or to Hazardous Materials; and (g) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has assumed or retained, by contract or operation of
law, any liabilities of any third party that would reasonably be expected to
result in liability to the Company under any Environmental Laws or concerning
any Hazardous Materials. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Hazardous
Materials_ " means any (i) chemical, product, substance, waste, pollutant,
physical agent, or contaminant that is defined or listed as hazardous or toxic
or that is otherwise regulated under, or that could result in liability
pursuant to, any Environmental Law; (ii) asbestos containing materials,
whether in a friable or non-friable condition, lead-containing material,
polychlorinated biphenyls, naturally occurring radioactive materials or

derivatives thereof.

 



22 Section 4.14 _Intellectual Property_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries exclusively own, free of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens),
their proprietary Intellectual Property and own or possess adequate licenses
or other valid rights to use all other Intellectual Property used in their
businesses, except where the failure to own or possess such licenses and
other rights, individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All material Intellectual Property applications and
registrations owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries are subsisting and
unexpired and, to the knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable, and
there are no assertions or claims challenging the validity or enforceability
of any material Intellectual Property owned by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or their right to use any Intellectual Property except, in
each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The conduct of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries respective businesses as currently conducted does not conflict
with or infringe any Intellectual Property of any other Person, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate constitute a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries take reasonable actions to
maintain and protect their Intellectual Property (including any that is
confidential in nature) and the integrity and operation of their systems and
software, and there have been no violations, interruptions or outages of same
except, in each case, where the failure to take such actions and the
occurrence of such violations, interruptions or outages would not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There is no infringement of any Intellectual Property owned by or
licensed by or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, do not constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect. For the purposes of this Agreement, "
_Intellectual Property_ " means all worldwide intellectual property and
industrial property rights, including all patents, patent rights, know-how,
trade secrets, inventions, technology, processes, trademarks,
trademark rights, service marks, domain names, trade dress, and other source
indicators, copyrights, works of authorship, computer software and systems,
and trade secrets, and any applications, registrations, renewals, foreign
counterparts, extensions, continuations, continuations-in-part, re-
examinations, reissues, and divisional of the foregoing.

Section 4.15  _Decrees, Etc._ Except for such matters that, individually or
in the aggregate, do not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, (a) no
order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment, award or determination of any
Governmental Authority or any arbitral or other dispute resolution body has
been issued or entered against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
that continues to be in effect that affects the ownership or operation of any
of their respective assets and (b) no criminal order, writ, fine, injunction,
decree, judgment or determination of any Governmental Authority has been
issued against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that continues to
be in effect.

 

Section 4.16 _Insurance_.

(a) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, do not
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage with financially responsible
insurance companies against such risks and in

 



23  such amounts as are customary in the industries in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate and (ii) each insurance policy of the Company and its
Subsidiaries outstanding is in full force and effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not reached or exceeded their policy limits for any
insurance policies in effect at any time during the past three years. No
insurance provider has issued any reservation right letters for any claims
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.

(b) Excluding insurance policies that have expired and been replaced in the
ordinary course of business, no excess liability or protection and indemnity
insurance policy has been canceled by the insurer, and no threat in writing
has been made to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure
to renew) any such insurance policy of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company. Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, do
not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, no event has occurred,
including the failure by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to give
any notice or information or by giving any inaccurate or erroneous notice or
information, which limits or impairs the rights of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company under any such excess liability or protection and
indemnity insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement.

Section 4.17 _No Brokers_. The Company has not entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding with any Person or firm which may result in the
obligation of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to pay any finders fees,
brokerage or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading
to this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, except that the
Company has retained Perella Weinberg Partners L.P. (" _Perella Weinberg_ ")
as its financial advisor. True, correct and complete copies of all agreements
with Perella Weinberg relating to any such fees or other payments have been
furnished to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

Section 4.18 _Opinion of Financial Advisor and Board Approval_. The Company
Board has received the opinion of Perella Weinberg (the " _Fairness Opinion_
") to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations relating to such opinion, the Per
Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Shares (other than the Affiliates of Parent), it being agreed that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any rights with respect to such opinion. A
true, complete and correct copy of the Fairness Opinion will be provided to
Parent, for informational purposes only, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement. The Company
Board, at a meeting duly called and held, unanimously (with two members
abstaining) (i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable
and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company; (ii) approved
this Agreement and the Merger and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of
the Company adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ ").

 

Section 4.19 _Vote Required_. The only vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Company that may be necessary to adopt this
Agreement is the affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
by holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote
thereon (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ").

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment

part of the terms and conditions of any "requirements" or similar
agreement under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to
procure goods or services exclusively from any Person; (vii) that provides the
Company or its Subsidiaries rights as to operation, management or control of a
partnership, joint venture or similar arrangement, unless immaterial to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (viii) that relates to any
acquisition of a business by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any material continuing

Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or prohibits the issuance of
guarantees by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. Each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in
this Section 4.20(a), whether nor not set forth in Section 4.20(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and any contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of such type entered into after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing, is referred to herein as a " _Material Contract_." The Company
has made available to Parent complete, true and correct copies of all Material

25 (b) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, do not
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect:

implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Section 4.21 _Takeover Statutes; Rights Plans_. The restrictions on "business
combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL or other takeover

Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company does not have any
preferred share purchase rights plan or similar rights plan in effect.

 

Section 4.22 _Title, Ownership and Related Matters_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens,
defensible title to their respective inventory, equipment and other tangible
and intangible property, rights and assets, in each case as necessary to
permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective
businesses as currently conducted. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Permitted Liens_ " shall mean routine statutory Liens securing liabilities
and Liens for taxes not yet due and payable; and Liens existing or expressly
permitted pursuant to indentures and credit facilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries existing as of the date of this Agreement or refinancings thereof
or Liens that would be permitted under Section 6.1 hereof; Liens imposed or
promulgated by Applicable Laws with respect to real property and

prior to the

 



26  date hereof); and Liens which, in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely
to impair, in any material respect, the continued use of such asset or
property (or interest therein) as it is presently used.

Section 4.23 _Proxy Statement_.

(a) The proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as
amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. The Proxy
Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendments or
supplements thereto) is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at
the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 4.23(a) to the contrary, no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

Section 4.24 _Transactions with Affiliates_. There are no agreements,
contracts, plans, arrangements or other transactions between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any (i) officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) record or beneficial owner of
five percent or more of the voting securities of the Company, (iii) Affiliate
or family member of any such officer, director or record or beneficial owner
or (iv) any other Affiliate of the Company, on the other hand, except

Company and/or its Subsidiaries and those of a type available to employees of
the Company generally.

Section 4.25 _FCPA and OFAC Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective agents or
representatives has, in the course of its actions for, or on behalf of, any of
them (a) knowingly used any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution,
gift, entertainment or other unlawful expense relating to political activity,
(b) unlawfully offered or provided, directly or indirectly, anything of value
to (or received anything of value from) any foreign or domestic government
employee or official or any other Person, (c) violated any provision of
the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and any
rules or regulations promulgated thereunder (" _FCPA_ ") or other similar laws
of other jurisdictions or (d) violated any provision of the UK Bribery Act
or other similar laws of other jurisdictions. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries have instituted and maintain policies
and procedures designed to ensure, and which are reasonably expected to
continue to ensure, continued compliance with the FCPA. Except as

 



27  would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Company Material
Adverse Effect, neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any of their respective agents or representatives
has, in the course of its actions for, or on behalf of any of them, directly
or indirectly taken any action in violation of any applicable export control
laws, anti-boycott regulations, embargo regulations or other similar
applicable United States or foreign laws. To the knowledge of the Company,
none of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives is a "specially designated national" or
blocked person under United States sanctions administered by the Office of
Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (" _OFAC_ ").
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material
Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
engaged in any business with any Person with whom, or in any country in which,
it is prohibited for a United States Person to engage under applicable law or
under applicable United States sanctions administered by OFAC.

Section 4.26 _Energy Regulatory Matters_. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to regulation as a "public utility" under the Federal
Power Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. The

Subsidiaries) has a capacity of less than 50 megawatts and is fundamentally
used for its own industrial uses with any excess electric energy sold
exclusively within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region of
Texas. 

ARTICLE 5

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to the Company by
Parent at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Letter_ ") and making reference to the particular section or
subsection of this Agreement ( _provided_ that any information set forth in
one section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
apply to each other section or subsection thereof where its relevance to such
other section is reasonably apparent), Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and
severally, represent and warrant to the Company that:

 

Section 5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or
a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing
under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the transaction of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified, or
in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to the
Company true, complete

 



28  and correct copies of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in
effect as of the date hereof. The organizational and governing documents of
Parent and Merger Sub are in full force and effect.

Section 5.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. No vote of the
holders of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement and
the Transactions. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Voting
Agreements, and, upon receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote, to consummate the
Transactions. The execution of this Agreement and the Voting Agreements and
the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf of Parent and Merger
Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Voting Agreements or to
consummate the Transactions, other than, with respect to the Merger, the
adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub
(the " _Requisite Parent Vote_ "), which will occur immediately following the
execution of this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement and the Voting Agreements. Assuming this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements have been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company, this Agreement and the Voting Agreements constitute
the valid and legally binding obligations of each of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with their respective
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors
rights, general principles of equity and any implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing.

 

Section 5.3 _No Conflict_.

(a) Neither the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement or the Voting Agreements nor the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the transactions in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof will
(i) subject to receipt of the Requisite Parent Vote conflict with or result in
a breach of any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Parent and Merger Sub; (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach
of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination or cancellation or in a right of termination or cancellation of,
or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties, assets or rights of Parent or its
Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable or without
further binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, concession,
franchise, permit, lease, sublease, contract, agreement, joint venture or
other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties, assets or rights may be bound or affected; or (iii)
subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 5.3(b),
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any their respective
properties, assets or rights are bound, except for such matters, in the case
of matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), that do not, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



29 (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement or the Voting Agreements nor the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the Transactions in accordance with the terms hereof will require any
consent, approval, qualification, authorization or permit of, action by,
filing or registration with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority
other than (i) Regulatory Filings and the filings and notifications required
under applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws in the jurisdictions listed in
Section 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, (ii) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
and (iii) any filing, consent, approval, qualification, authorization, permit,
decision or action, the failure of which to obtain, and for any such filing,
registration or notification the failure of which to make, does not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.4 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending against Parent or Merger
Sub or, to Parents knowledge, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub or
against any of their respective properties, rights or assets, or any of their
respective directors, officers or employees in their capacity as such, at law
or in equity or in any arbitration or similar proceedings, before or by any
U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. court, commission, board, bureau, agency or
instrumentality or any U.S. or non-U.S. arbitral or other dispute resolution
body, that, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 5.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 4.3, 4.7(a) and 4.17, the performance by the Company of its
obligations under this Agreement and the funding of the Financing in
accordance with the Financing Letters, the amount of funds contemplated to be
provided pursuant to the Financing Letters together with any available Company
cash shall on the Closing Date be sufficient (i) to acquire all of the
outstanding Shares in accordance with the terms of the Merger, to pay all cash
amounts to be paid with respect to the Companys outstanding equity
compensation awards pursuant to Section 3.3 and to pay all fees and expenses
payable by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement and the Financing
Letters and (ii) to consummate the transactions described in Section 6.18 and
the refinancing of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated
as of April 29, 2010 among TPC Group LLC, the other borrowers named therein,
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as administrative agent, and the other
lenders named therein, as amended (the " _Existing Credit Facility_ ").

(b) Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company complete and accurate
copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i) an executed commitment
letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Equity Financing
Letter_ "), pursuant to which the investors 

 



30  party thereto have committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof, to invest the cash amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ "), and (ii) an executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
of this Agreement, from Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated, Jefferies Finance LLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.
(the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Financing
Letter, the " _Financing Letters_ "), pursuant to which the lenders party
thereto have committed to provide, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein
(being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with
the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Parent and Merger Sub also have
delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of any fee letter
(the " _Fee Letter_ ") and any engagement letter (the " _Engagement Letter_ ")
in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that any
such Fee Letter or Engagement Letter provided to the Company may be redacted
to omit the numerical fee amounts provided therein).

(c) As of the date hereof, neither of the Financing Letters nor the Fee
Letter or Engagement Letter referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter has been
amended, restated or otherwise modified, and no such amendment, restatement or
modification is presently contemplated, and the commitments set forth in the
Financing Letters have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. The Financing Letters, in the form so delivered to the Company on the
date hereof, are in full force and effect and each constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Parent or Merger Sub and (in the case of the Debt
Commitment Letter, to the knowledge of the officers of Parent or Merger Sub)
the other parties thereto, in each case subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to creditors rights, general principles of equity and any
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letters. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties set forth herein, as of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the investors party to the Equity Financing Letter, as
applicable, or (to the knowledge of the officers of Parent) any other party
thereto under any term or condition of the Financing Letters, except that no
representation or warranty is made to the extent that any term or condition
requires any action by, or otherwise relates to, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties contained herein, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to
Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date. Except for any Fee Letter or any
Engagement Letter, as of the date hereof there are no side letters or other
written or oral agreements, contracts or arrangements to which Parent or
Merger Sub or any Affiliate thereof is a party related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the Financing other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Letters delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof.
Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid or caused to be paid any and all
commitment and other fees, costs and expenses that have been incurred and are
due and payable on or prior to the date hereof in connection with the
Financing Letters.

any existing indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding.

Section 5.7 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is owned directly by Parent. Merger Sub has been formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and, as of the
Effective Time, will not have engaged in any activities other than in
connection with the Transactions. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub will have 1,000 outstanding shares of its common stock, par value
$0.01 per share.

Section 5.8 _No Brokers_. None of Parent and Merger Sub has entered into any
contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person or firm which may
result in the obligation of the Company to pay any finders fees, brokerage
or other like payments prior to the Effective Time in connection with the
negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions.

 

Section 5.9 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Assuming (i) the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the
Merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein (for such
purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all
material respects without giving effect to any knowledge, materiality or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception) and compliance
in all material respects by the Company with the covenants contained herein
and (iii) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that have been provided by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub
prior to the date hereof (as identified on Section 5.9 of the Company
Disclosure Letter) have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
that were reasonable at the date hereof, and after giving effect to the
Transactions, including the Financing, any alternative financing permitted
hereunder and the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.3, any other repayment or refinancing
of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Letters, payment of
all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after
the consummation of the Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any
date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all
"liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance
with Applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors,
and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of
such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person

the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged as of such date or as
proposed to be engaged

 



32  and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such date,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature or become due. For

capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged" and "able
to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature or become due" means that such Person will be
able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

38  and the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the

Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after
receipt thereof and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after comments are received from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) thereon and after the furnishing by the Company
and Parent of all information required to be contained therein, the Company
shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and file any required amendments
to the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC) for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall consult with Parent regarding, and provide
Parent with copies of, all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response. If at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Applicable Laws, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The
Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which
the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on
the Proxy Statement mail to the stockholders of the Company the Proxy
Statement and all other proxy materials for the Company Stockholders Meeting.
The Company and Parent shall make any necessary filings with respect to the
Merger, the Voting Agreements and the Transactions under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.3 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the
Company Board (or a committee thereof), shall (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable following confirmation by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) that
it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement take all action necessary to
set a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") and (ii) subject to Section
6.4, include in the Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of
the Company as of the record date established for the Company
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on
which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further
comments on

 



39  the Proxy Statement. Unless the Agreement has been duly terminated in
accordance with the terms herein, the Company shall, subject to the right of
the Company Board to modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent
under the circumstances specified in Section 6.4(d), use reasonable best
efforts to solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of
the proposal to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and to secure the
Company Stockholder Approval (it being understood that the foregoing shall not
require the Company Board to recommend in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, if a Change of Recommendation has been effected in accordance
with Section 6.4(d)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, solely to the extent necessary to
ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company with adequate time to
review or (ii) with the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholders Meeting.

Section 6.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4, the Company shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 8, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries
regarding, or the making of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-
public information or data to, any Person relating to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
contacting and engaging in discussions with such Person for the sole purpose
of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and informing such Person of the
existence of this Section 6.4) or (iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate
(including by providing information) any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Representatives_ " shall mean the affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives of any Person.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(a), at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company
receives a written unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal from any Person
or group of Persons, then (A) the Company and its Representatives may provide
information, including non-public information (which may be by posting to the
"virtual data room" available to Parent and its Representatives) in response
to a request therefor by such Person or group of Persons if such Person or
group of Persons has executed and delivered to the Company a confidentiality
agreement containing provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood,
however, that the confidentiality agreement need not prohibit, condition
or restrict the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal) (an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), _provided_ that any material non-
public information that the

 



40  Company made available to such Person or group of Persons has previously
been made available to Parent or is promptly (and in any event within 24 hours
after the time it is provided to such Person or group of Persons) made
available to Parent, and (B) the Company and its Representatives may engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person or group of
Persons regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if and only if prior to taking
any action described in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company Board or the
Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, that (x) failure to
take such action would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws and (y) such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer by a Third Party with
respect to (i) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction or series of transactions which would result in the
acquisition by a Third Party of more than 20% of the total voting power of
the capital stock or more than 20% of the consolidated assets (based on the
fair market value thereof, as determined by the Company Board) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (ii) a transaction or a series of transactions that,
if consummated, would result, directly or indirectly, in the acquisition by a
Third Party of more than 20% of the total voting power of the capital stock or
more than 20% of the consolidated assets (based on the fair market
value thereof, as determined by the Company Board) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Transactions.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal which would
result in the acquisition by a Third Party of more than 50% of the total
voting power of the capital stock or more than 50% of the consolidated assets
(based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Company Board)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that the Company Board or any appropriate
committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with the Companys outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, (i) is reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its
terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory, financial, financing and
timing and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal,
and (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after having complied with, and giving effect
to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and Merger Sub in
response to such proposal or otherwise pursuant to, Section 6.4(d)). 

" _Third Party_ " means any Person or group other than (i) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (ii) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 



41 (d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4(d), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose to authorize,
adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable), any Acquisition
Proposal (each action described in this clause (i), a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ");

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter
into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive
agreement or any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in
principle with respect thereto, in each case together with any ancillary
agreements (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal;
or

(iii) take any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board or the Special
Committee may effect a Change of Recommendation (and, solely in connection
with accepting a Superior Proposal as contemplated thereby, take action
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) of this Agreement), if (A) there has been a
material event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that (1) does
not relate to any Acquisition Proposal or any developments, circumstances or
occurrences relating to Parent or any of its Affiliates as a result of this
Agreement and (2) is unknown and is not reasonably foreseeable to or by the
Company Board on or prior to the date of this Agreement (or if known, the
magnitude or material consequences of which were not known and were not
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board on or prior to the date hereof)
(such event, fact, circumstance, development, occurrence, magnitude or
consequence, an " _Intervening Event_ ") or (B) the Company Board or
the Special Committee has received a written unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of Persons that is not withdrawn
and that the Company Board or the Special Committee believes in good faith
after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel constitutes a Superior Proposal, but only if, in each case of clauses
(A) and (B), prior to effecting the Change of Recommendation or taking action
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) the Company Board or the Special Committee
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that failure to do so would, in the case of clause (A), violate or, in the
case of clause (B), reasonably likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Laws; _provided_ that the Company shall not be
entitled to effect any Change of Recommendation or to take action pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) of this Agreement unless:

 

(x) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a " _Notice of
Proposed Change of Recommendation_ ") to Parent and Merger Sub of its
intention to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or to take action pursuant
to Section 8.3(a) and such notice shall specify (1) if the Company Board or
the Special Committee believes that an Intervening Event has occurred, a
reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event and (2) if the
proposed Change of Recommendation is in respect of a

 



42  Superior Proposal, the basis for such Change of Recommendation, including,
the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal (except to the extent
disclosure of such identity would breach a confidentiality obligation in
effect prior to the execution of this Agreement) and the material terms and
conditions thereof (unless such Superior Proposal is in written form, in which
case the Company shall provide Parent copies of all written requests,
proposals or offers and the proposed transaction agreements and any financing
commitments comprising or relating thereto, which may be redacted, if
necessary, to solely remove the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal in order to comply with confidentiality obligations to such Person
in effect prior to the execution of this Agreement);

(y) if any changes to this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Limited
Guaranties shall have been offered in writing by Parent during the three
business day period following Parents and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice
of Proposed Change of Recommendation in a manner that would form a binding
contract if accepted by the Company, the Company Board or such committee shall
have considered such changes in good faith and shall have determined, if the
intended Change of Recommendation is the result of a Superior Proposal, that
the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if
such changes were to be given effect; and

 

(z) the Superior Proposal did not result from a material breach by the Company
of its obligations under this Section 6.4;

_provided_ that, if the intended Change of Recommendation is the result of a
Superior Proposal, in the event of any material amendment to the financial
terms or any other material revisions to such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Proposed Change of Recommendation
to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.4(d) with respect to such new Notice of Proposed Change of Recommendation,
except that the reference to the three business day period above shall be
deemed to be a reference to a two business day period. 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law, including taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company); _provided_ that any Change of Recommendation may
be made only in accordance with Section 6.4(d).

(f) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in this Section
6.4, from and after the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it
will promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) business day) (i) notify
Parent if the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information or other inquiry that the Company believes is reasonably likely to
lead to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) in connection with such notice,
provide to

 



43  Parent the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal or request or inquiry (except to the extent disclosure of
such identity would breach a confidentiality obligation in effect prior to
the execution of this Agreement) and a summary of the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or request or other inquiry
(unless such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry is in written form, in
which case the Company shall provide Parent copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers and the proposed transaction agreements and financing
commitments comprising or relating thereto, which may be redacted, if
necessary, to remove the identity of the Person making the written requests,
proposals or offers in order to comply with confidentiality obligations to
such Person in effect prior to the execution of this Agreement). The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in any event,
within one (1) business day), of any material change to the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal or request or inquiry (including any amendments thereto).

 

Section 6.5 _Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts, Etc_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company and
Parent and its Affiliates shall (it being understood that any failure of any
such Affiliate to comply with this Section 6.5(a) shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of such section by the Company or Parent, as applicable),
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to:

(i) as promptly as practicable, make (or cause to be made) their respective
required filings under the HSR Act and any applicable non-U.S. competition,

Section 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (" _Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws_ ")
(and Parent shall pay all filing fees incident to all such filings by Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and their respective Affiliates
and Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) submit all filings

filings required by Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws, not more than 10 business days
from the date hereof; (B) submit a Case Team Allocation Request to the Merger
Registry of the Directorate-General for Competition of the European

complete Form CO with the European Commission no later than two (2) business
days following the date on which the relevant case team at the European

shall promptly make any other required submissions under the HSR Act or in
the jurisdictions identified in Section 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter;

(ii) promptly notify each other of any communication concerning this Agreement
or the Transactions to that party or any of its Affiliates from any
Governmental Authority and, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Laws
or such Governmental Authority, permit the other party to review in advance
any

 



44  proposed communication concerning this Agreement or the Transactions to any
Governmental Authority and provide a reasonable opportunity for the other
party to provide comments and for any such reasonable comments to be
accounted for prior to their submission;

(iii) not participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry concerning
this Agreement or the Transactions unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws or such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting or discussion;

(iv) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its Affiliates and representatives on the one hand, and any government or
regulatory authority or members of any such authoritys staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, except any
confidential information or business secrets, which information shall be
provided to counsel on a counsel-to-counsel basis;

(v) furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in
connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or
submissions of information to any Governmental Authorities, including
the Proxy Statement and any filings necessary or appropriate under the
provisions of the HSR Act and applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws;

(vi) subject to Section 6.5(c), "substantially comply" and certify substantial
compliance with any request for additional information (also known as a
"second request") issued pursuant to the HSR Act as soon as reasonably
practicable following the issuance of the request for additional information;
and

(vii) use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article 7 are satisfied
and to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary authorizations, consents and approvals, and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings.

(b) Without limiting Section 6.5(a), the Company, Parent and Parents
Affiliates shall each use (it being understood that any failure of any such
Affiliate to comply with this Section 6.5(b) shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of such section by the Company or Parent, as applicable), and cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts promptly to:

(i) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act and to obtain required clearances and approvals under
applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws as promptly as reasonably practicable;

 



45 (ii) avoid the entry of any decree, order or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing;

(iii) take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary
decree, order or judgment is entered, issued or enacted, or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any proceeding,
review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would materially
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, any and all steps (including the
appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated
by clause (ii) of this Section 6.5(b)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify,
reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated
or threatened decree, order or judgment so as to permit such consummation on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iv) take any and all steps necessary to obtain any consents or eliminate any
impediments to the Merger.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and subject to
the last sentence of this Section 6.5(c), the obligations of Parent under
this Section 6.5 shall include Parent committing to, as a condition to and in
return for obtaining any and all expirations of waiting periods under the HSR
Act or consents from any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
Transactions under the Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws in the jurisdictions identified
in Section 5.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter: (i) agreeing to sell,
divest or otherwise convey any particular asset, category, portion or part of
an asset or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously
with or subsequent to the Effective Time; (ii) agreeing to permit the Company
to sell, divest or otherwise convey any of the particular assets, categories,
portions or parts of assets or business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) licensing, holding
separate or entering into similar arrangements with respect to the assets of
the Company or conduct of business arrangements or terminating any and all
joint venture, strategic partnership and other similar agreements, in each
case, to the extent such action is necessary to avoid, prevent, eliminate or
remove the issuance or enactment of any order, decree, decision,
determination, judgment or law that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of Transactions by any Governmental Authority.
No actions taken pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 6.5(c)
shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or
Merger Sub be obligated to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
agree with a Governmental Authority without the prior written consent of
Parent, to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar
arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or
any portion of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if such
divestiture or hold separate involves assets that are material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or if such licensing or similar
arrangement would materially adversely affect assets that are material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

 



46 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.5(c) with respect to its business or
operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned
upon the Closing. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of
its Affiliates to sell, divest or otherwise convey any of their respective
assets, categories, portions or parts of assets or businesses (other than
assets or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent
provided in Section 6.5(c)) at any time or to license, hold separate or enter
into similar arrangements with respect to their respective assets or conduct
of business arrangements or to terminate any of their respective existing
relationships or contractual rights or obligations as a condition to obtaining
any expiration of waiting periods under the HSR Act or consents from
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Transactions.

 

(e) Parent and its Affiliates shall not (it being understood that any failure
of any such Affiliate to comply with this Section 6.5(e) shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of such section by Parent) make any investment or
acquisition if, individually or in the aggregate, such investment or
acquisition would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede,
interfere with or delay the consummation of the Merger or the Transactions
(except, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to assets or businesses of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in Section 6.5(c)).

 

Section 6.6 _Access and Reports_.

(a) Subject to Applicable Laws then in effect and applicable contractual
restrictions in effect on the date hereof, upon reasonable notice, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers and other
authorized Representatives of Parent and the Financing Sources of Parent,
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to its and its Subsidiaries officers and its and its
Subsidiaries properties, offices and other facilities and its and its
Subsidiaries books, contracts, personnel files and records and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent and its
Representatives and Financing Sources from time to time; _provided_ that any
such access shall be coordinated through one of the persons listed on Section
6.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter and provided further that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company herein; and _provided,
further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) (A) to permit
any inspection that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, would be
materially disruptive to the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or (B) to disclose any information that would, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality, (ii) to disclose any information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, be

 



47  prohibited by Applicable Laws or waive the protection of attorney-client,
work product or other legal privilege, (iii) to provide access to or otherwise
make available any information relating to the process conducted by the
Company that led to the execution of this Agreement or (iv) to provide access
to or otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to the extent
that the provision of such information could in the judgment of the Company
based on advice of counsel violate Applicable Law. The parties will use
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence
apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its
Representatives shall have the right to conduct any surface or subsurface soil
or surface or ground water sampling, monitoring, borings or testing on any
properties owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the generality of this Section 6.6, from the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time (or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms), the Company will furnish to Parent promptly after becoming
available, monthly financial statements including an unaudited balance sheet,
income statement and statement of cash flows for each month through the
Closing Date as well as any update of its outlook for the quarter or the
balance of the fiscal year, each as it may prepare for managements internal
use. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that notwithstanding the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent may provide such information to potential
sources of capital and to rating agencies and prospective lenders (including
the Financing Sources) and investors during syndication of the Available
Financing subject to the execution of customary confidentiality agreements
with such Persons regarding such information.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent
would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, and (iii) if such party
becomes aware of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected
to cause any condition set forth in Article 7 not to be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6(b)
shall not cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of
this Agreement.

Section 6.7 _Publicity_. Unless and until a Change of Recommendation has
occurred in connection with Section 6.4(d), the Company and Parent each shall
consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements (other than routine employee communications) with
respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Authority (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Applicable Laws or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental
Authority. Parent and the Company agree that the press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent
and the Company.

 



48 Section 6.8 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Each of the Company
and Parent shall cause the Companys securities to be delisted from the
NASDAQ Stock Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.9 _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article 3\. Except as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence or as otherwise provided in Section 8.6,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense, except that Parent shall pay or reimburse the
Company for (a) Parents reimbursement obligations pursuant to Sections
6.13(c) and 6.18(e), (b) Parents indemnification obligations pursuant to
Sections 6.13(d) and 6.18(e) and (c) Parents payment obligations pursuant to
Section 6.5(a)(i). Any amounts that may be owed by Parent for reimbursement
pursuant to clause (a) of the preceding sentence shall be payable in one
lump-sum following final calculation and reasonable documentation of the total
amount of such fees and expenses incurred.

 

Section 6.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Laws (and shall also pay or advance expenses as incurred, to
the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Laws, to), each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, expenses
and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities
or amounts that are paid in settlement incurred in connection with any actual
or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Partys service as a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time or services performed by such
Indemnified Party, at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as a
fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or as a director or officer of
another Person at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, but not limited to, in
connection with (i) the Transactions and (ii) actions to enforce this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party in effect on the date hereof and copies of which have been made
available to Parent prior to the date hereof. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in or use reasonable best efforts in
the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided, however, that Parent and
the Surviving 

 



49  Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
respective prior written consent. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and
disbursements, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.10.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a), if any Indemnified
Party becomes involved in any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation covered by this Section 6.10 after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Laws, advance to such Indemnified Party his or her
legal or other expenses (including attorneys fees, expenses and
disbursements and the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in
connection therewith) within ten business days of receipt by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor,
subject to such Indemnified Party providing Parent and the Surviving
Corporation with an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the
event of a non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled thereto, but without any
requirement for the posting of a bond or any other terms or conditions other
than those expressly set forth herein.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancelable extension of
(i) the directors, officers and employees liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors, officers and employees insurance policies,
and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided, however_ , that in no
event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the "
_Maximum Premium_ ") (which annual amount the Company represents and warrants
is set forth on Section 6.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter). If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
to the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-
year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that
in no event shall Parent or the

 



50  Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of the Maximum Premium; and
_provided, further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium. 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.10.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) expressly intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her legal representatives and (ii) in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The provisions of
this Section 6.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger.

(f) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
Transactions) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in any
agreement in effect on the date hereof and made available to Parent prior to
the date hereof between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any current or former director or officer of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, will be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation without further action, as of the Effective Time, and will
survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. The Charter and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company
Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of such director or officer, unless such
modification is required by Applicable Laws during such period.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the case of Sections
6.10(c) and 6.10(f) in the event that any claim for indemnification is
asserted or made on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until
the final disposition of such claim.

Section 6.11 _Takeover Provisions_. If any Takeover Provision is or may become
applicable to the Merger, the Voting Agreements or the Transactions, the
Company and the members of the Company Board shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger, the Voting Agreements
and the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Provision on any of the Merger, the Voting Agreements
or the Transactions.

 



51 Section 6.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the
Financing Letters (including, in the case of the Debt Financing, alternative
or additional debt financing consistent with the Debt Commitment Letter) and
any related Fee Letter and Engagement Letter and shall not agree to any
amendment or modification to be made to, or consent to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Financing Letters or any Fee Letter or
Engagement Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such
amendments, modifications or waivers (or, in the case of the Debt Commitment
Letter, alternative or additional debt financing) would (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount) from that contemplated in the Financing
Letters, or (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing or other terms in a manner that would be reasonably likely to (x)
materially delay or prevent the Closing, or (y) adversely impact the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the
other parties to any Financing Letter when required pursuant to this
Agreement or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. For purposes of
clarification, the foregoing shall not prohibit Parent from replacing or
amending the Debt Commitment Letter and any related Fee Letter or Engagement
Letter solely to add additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities, so long as the addition of such
additional parties would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to (x) materially delay or prevent the Closing, or (y) adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against the other parties to any Financing Letter when required
pursuant to this Agreement or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.
Any reference in this Agreement to (A) " _Financing_ " shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 6.12 and (B) " _Financing Letters_ " or " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " shall include such documents as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 6.12.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Financing Letters in accordance with their terms, (ii) negotiate and enter
into, as soon as reasonably practicable, all definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on
the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter and any related Fee Letter and Engagement Letter (or on
terms no less favorable, in the aggregate (other than with respect to
conditionality or amount, which must be no less favorable in any respect), to
Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letter and any related Fee Letter and Engagement Letter), (iii) satisfy on a
timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period) all conditions that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub, including
the payment of any commitment, engagement, placement or other fees required as
a condition to the Financing and consummate at 

 



52  or prior to the Closing the portion of the Debt Financing required for the
Closing, if all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing
provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied (other than
receipt of (A) the Equity Financing, (B) any conditions that are within the
control of Parent or Merger Sub, and (C) those conditions that by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which conditions
referenced in this clause (C) shall be capable of being satisfied on the
Closing Date), (iv) comply with its obligations under the Financing Letters,
the Engagement Letter and any related Fee Letter and any definitive agreements
relating to the Debt Financing, (v) fully enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter and any such definitive agreements (including, at the

Sources obligations thereunder), (vi) in the event that all conditions in the
Debt Commitment Letter (other than (A) the availability or funding of any
Equity Financing, (B) any conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter that are
within the control of Parent or Merger Sub, and (C) those conditions in the
Debt Commitment Letter that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date, but each of which, in the case of (C), shall be capable
of being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied, cause the
lenders and other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the Closing
Date, the portion of the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and
the Transactions and pay all other amounts payable by Parent and Merger Sub
under this Agreement and the Financing Letters or in connection with any
refinancing of indebtedness contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing
Letters and (vii) fully enforce the rights of Parent and Merger Sub, and the
Guarantors obligations, under the Equity Financing Letter, including (at the
request of the Company and subject to Section 9.12(b) by filing one or more

thereunder. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing and provide to the Company copies of all executed definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing ( _provided_ that any Fee Letter or
Engagement Letter may be redacted as contemplated by Section 5.5(b)). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
give the Company prompt notice (x) of any material breach, material default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Letter or definitive
document related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub become aware,
(y) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any notice or other
communication from any party to any Financing Letters with respect to any (A)

able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Letters on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated
by the Financing Letters or the definitive documents related to
the Financing.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain as promptly as
practicable alternative debt financing from alternative debt sources on terms
and conditions not less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent

 



53  and Merger Sub (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related Fee Letter or Engagement Letter
and in an amount at least equal to the amount of the Debt Financing or such
unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Debt
Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to
such Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") which
shall replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter, a true, complete and
correct copy of which (together with any related Fee Letter and Engagement
Letter (it being understood that any such Fee Letter or Engagement Letter
provided to the Company may be redacted to omit the numerical fee amounts
therein)) shall be promptly provided to the Company. In the event any New Debt
Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement

Merger Sub as of the date hereof) to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing"
shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this
Agreement (other than with respect to representations and warranties made by
Parent and Merger Sub as of the date hereof) to the "Financing Letters" or

Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in
question and the New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in
effect, (iii) any reference in this Agreement to "Financing Sources" shall be
deemed to include the entities that have committed to provide or otherwise
entered into agreements in connection with the Debt Financing (as modified
pursuant to clause (i) above) or other financings in connection with the
Transactions, including the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter (as modified
pursuant to clause (ii) above) and any definitive credit agreements relating
thereto, (iv) any reference in this Agreement to " _Fee Letter_ " shall be
deemed to include any fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letters that
are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and
any fee letter relating to New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in
effect and (v) any reference in this Agreement to " _Engagement Letter_ "
shall be deemed to include any engagement letter relating to the Debt
Commitment Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at
the time in question and any engagement letter relating to New Debt Commitment
Letters to the extent then in effect. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall any Guarantor be required to provide financing in excess of the amount
set forth in its respective Equity Financing Letter and in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be required to seek or obtain equity financing other than
the Equity Financing.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the

conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall be satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing) and

Closing Date were to be scheduled for any time during such fifteen (15)
consecutive business day period; _provided_ _that_ , if all the conditions
set forth in clauses (x) and (y) above have been satisfied (and continue to be
satisfied throughout the fifteen consecutive business day period) except that
the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) has not been satisfied because the
Company Stockholders Meeting has not yet been held, then the Marketing Period
shall be deemed to have commenced on the date that is five business days prior
to the date of the

 



54  Company Stockholders Meeting so long as the Company Stockholders Meeting is
held on such date and the Company Stockholders Approval is obtained on such
date as contemplated in Section 7.1(a) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Marketing Period shall not end prior to the date that is fifteen consecutive
business days following such commencement); _provided_ , _further_ , _that_
(i) such consecutive 15 business day period shall (x) commence no earlier
than September 4, 2012, (y) either end on or prior to December 19, 2012 or, if
such period has not ended on or prior to December 19, 2012, then such period
shall commence no earlier than January 2, 2013 and (z) exclude the days
between November 21, 2012 and November 25, 2012 and (ii) the Marketing Period
will not be deemed to have commenced if (w) the financial statements included
in the Required Information that is available to Parent on the first day of
the Marketing Period would not be sufficiently current on any day during such
period to satisfy the requirements of Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X for a
registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of such period, in which case the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced until the receipt by
Parent of updated Required Information that would be required under Rule 3-12
of Regulation S-X for a registration statement using such financial statements
to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such period, (x) the
Companys accountants shall have withdrawn their audit opinion with respect
to any financial statements contained in the audited financial statements of
the Company, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have
commenced unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with
respect thereto by the Companys auditors or another independent public
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent, (y) the Company issues a
public statement indicating its intent to restate any of its historical
financial statements or that any such restatement is under consideration or
may be a possibility, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed
to have commenced unless and until such restatement has been completed and the
relevant financial statements have been amended or the Company has announced
that it has concluded that no restatement shall be required in accordance with
GAAP or (z) the Company shall have been delinquent in filing any Form 10-K or
Form 10-Q or any other material SEC filing, in which case the Marketing
Period shall not be deemed to have commenced unless and until all such
delinquencies have been cured; _provided,_ further _,_ that the Marketing
Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which the Debt
Financing is obtained.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to
be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article 7, to consummate the Transactions.

Non-Union Employees, in the aggregate, employee benefits 

 



59  (excluding equity-based awards, executive welfare benefits, perquisites and

the aggregate, than those provided to Affected Non-Union Employees by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. With

to Applicable Law and the terms and conditions of any applicable collective
bargaining agreements and (y) prevent the amendment or termination of any

and benefit accrual thereunder (but not benefit accruals under defined benefit

4.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), service by the Affected Employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with the Surviving
Corporation, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits).

(c) To the extent permitted under Applicable Laws and except to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits, with respect to any employee
benefit plans maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Affected Employees, the Surviving
Corporation will (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the
same extent waived under comparable Company Benefit Plans and (ii) give
effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to amounts paid by such Affected Employees during the calendar
year in which Effective Time occurs under similar Company Benefit Plans.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.14 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Affected Employee), other than the parties hereto and
their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this
Section 6.14) under or by reason of this Agreement nor shall any provision of
this Section 6.14 constitute an amendment or modification of any of
the Company Benefit Plans.

Section 6.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in,
but not control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company or its directors or officers arising after the date hereof

Section 6.18 _Senior Secured Notes Tender Offer; Consent Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall take
all actions necessary to consummate the redemption or other purchase of, or
consent solicitation for, all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
the 8 1/4% Notes due 2017 of TPC Group LLC (the " _Notes_ ") issued under the
Indenture, dated as of October 5, 2010, by and among TPC Group LLC, the
guarantors party thereto, Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee, and Deutsche

 



61  Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent, paying agent, registrar
and authentication agent (the " _Indenture_ "), or the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture with respect thereto, at or prior to the Effective
Time. If requested by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent or an Affiliate of Parent or the Company, at Parents
option, in commencing an offer to purchase, and related consent solicitation
with respect to, the Notes, on the terms and conditions specified by Parent in
compliance with the Indenture and the Notes (the " _Debt Offer_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the closing of any Debt Offer shall be
conditioned on the completion of the Merger, (ii) no such consent solicitation
shall result in a consent, amendment, supplement or waiver with respect to the
Indenture that is effective prior to the Effective Time and (iii) any Debt
Offer or consent solicitation shall otherwise be consummated in compliance
with Applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations. If requested by Parent in
writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer or consent solicitation for
the Notes (or in addition thereto), the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions applicable to
the Notes (including the Indenture), issue a notice of optional redemption for
the outstanding principal amount of the Notes in accordance with the terms
and conditions applicable thereto (including the Indenture); provided that no
action described in this sentence shall be required to be taken unless such
redemption can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time. If
requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts, to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions applicable to the
Notes (including the Indenture), to deliver an optional redemption notice to
the trustee under the Indenture pursuant to the "equity claw" provision under
the Indenture, along with any required documentation, 30 days prior to the
Closing Date, conditioned in part on the Debt Offer not being consummated, to
redeem up to 35% of the Companys existing principal amount of Notes using a
portion of the proceeds received by the Company as part of the Equity
Financing; provided that no action described in this sentence shall be
required to be taken unless such redemption can be conditioned on the
occurrence of the Effective Time.

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent
solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received,
each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable
trustee to) execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture, which
supplemental indenture shall implement the amendments described in the offer
to purchase, related letter of transmittal and other related
documents (collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") and shall become
operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offer).
Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to accept
for payment and thereafter promptly pay for the Notes that have been properly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer and in
accordance with the Debt Offer.

 

(c) In the event that the Debt Offer is not consummated, the Company covenants
and agrees that it will, to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions
applicable to the Notes (including the Indenture), take all actions necessary
to satisfy and discharge the Indenture under the terms thereof, including (i)
substantially simultaneous with the Effective Time, irrevocably depositing
funds provided by Parent or Merger Sub sufficient to pay off all indebtedness
under the Indenture, including all accrued and unpaid interest, and providing
irrevocable instructions to the paying agent under the Indenture, (ii)
providing an appropriate officers certificate and opinion in form reasonably
satisfactory to the trustee under the Indenture

 



62  and (iii) providing appropriate optional redemption notices reasonably
satisfactory to the trustee under the Indenture; provided that no action
described in this sentence shall be required to be taken unless such
redemption can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time.

(d) Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of
the necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offer
Documents. The Debt Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements)
and all mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offer
shall be subject to the prior review of the Company and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion
of the Debt Offer any information in the Debt Offer Documents should be
discovered by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on
the other, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt
Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to
promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
prepared by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders of the Notes (which
supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of
Parent and the Company, take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form
8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.18(d), the
Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply with the requirements
of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other Applicable Law to the
extent such laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offer.

(e) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Section 6.18. Without duplication of any amounts to be
reimbursed by Parent pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, if the
Closing does not occur, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and Representatives
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
them in connection with their compliance with this Section 6.18 or the
provision of information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided in writing specifically for such use by or on behalf the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Laws.

(f) Without limiting the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b), Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the pendency or consummation of any
Debt Offer, consent solicitation or redemption with respect to the Notes is
not a condition to the Closing.

Section 6.19 _Existing Credit Agreement Matters_. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent, at least three business days
prior to the Effective Time, fully executed copies of payoff letters, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent (including the total payoff
amount required to fully satisfy all

 



63  outstanding obligations thereunder and any daily accrual thereafter), from
the administrative agent under the Companys Existing Credit Facility which
payoff letters shall provide that upon receipt of the applicable payoff
amount there shall occur the release of all guarantees, Liens and other
security over the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties and assets
securing its obligations under such Existing Credit Facility, together with
the return of any collateral in the possession of the relevant administrative
agent or the collateral agent, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time.

the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date,

six months after the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.2(a) shall not be available (i) to any party if the failure of such

respect, its obligations under this Agreement; or

 



66 (c) a Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or

8.5;

 

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if Parent or Merger Sub shall
have breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement made
by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or if any such representation (other
than the representations set forth in Section 5.9 hereof) and warranty shall
have become inaccurate after the date of this Agreement and such breach or
inaccuracy would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b), if continuing on the
Closing Date, being satisfied, and such breach or inaccuracy (i) cannot
be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the Termination Date or (ii) if capable
of being cured, shall not have been cured on or before the earlier of (x) 30
calendar days following receipt of written notice from the Company thereof
or (y) the expiration of any shorter period of time that remains between the
date the Company provides written notice of such breach or inaccuracy and the
date that is three business days prior to the Termination Date; _provided_
that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) if it is then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder that would result in the
failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 being satisfied; or

(c) if (i) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate the Closing
on the date on which the Closing is to occur pursuant to Section 1.2, (ii) all
of the conditions set forth in Article 7 have been and continue to be
satisfied or have been waived on the date on which the Closing was to
have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 (other than those conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing), and (iii) the
Company stood ready and willing to consummate the Closing on the date on which
the Closing was to occur pursuant to Section 1.2.

 



67 Section 8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated, and
the Transactions may be abandoned, by action of the board of directors of
Parent:

(a) prior to the Effective Time, if (i) the Company Board or the Special
Committee shall have made a Change of Recommendation (whether or not in
compliance with Section 6.4), (ii) the Company Board fails to recommend
against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer for any outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal
(other than by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders, which shall constitute a
failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer, within ten (10) business days after commencement, or (iii) the Company
shall have entered into, or publicly announced its intention to enter into,
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement; or

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if the Company shall have
breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement made by the
Company in this Agreement or if any such representation and warranty shall
have become inaccurate after the date of this Agreement, and such breach or
inaccuracy would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a failure of a
condition in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), if continuing on the Closing
Date, being satisfied, and such breach or inaccuracy (x) cannot be cured by
the Company by the Termination Date or (y) if capable of being cured, shall

receipt of written notice from Parent thereof or (B) the expiration of any
shorter period of time that remains between the date Parent provides written
notice of such breach or inaccuracy and the date that is three business days
prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) if it is
then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement

in Section 7.3 being satisfied.

Section 8.5 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and the abandonment of the Transactions pursuant to this Article 8, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or
Affiliates); _provided, however_ , and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, that (i) except as otherwise provided
herein and subject to Section 8.5(e) (including the limitation on liability
set forth therein), no such termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms shall relieve any party from any liability to pay the fees,
expenses and other amounts set forth in this Section 8.5 or Section 8.6 if and
when due pursuant to the provisions thereof, (ii) subject to Section 8.5(e)
(including the limitation on liability set forth therein), no such
termination shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach by
such party (it being understood that, for purposes of this Agreement, "willful
breach" shall mean a material breach that is the consequence of an omission
by, or act undertaken by or caused by, the breaching party with the knowledge
(actual or constructive) that the omission or taking or causing of such act
would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this

 



68  Agreement), (iii) no such termination shall relieve Parent from any payment
or reimbursement obligation under Sections 6.5(a)(i), 6.13(c), 6.18(e) or
8.5(d) or Parents indemnification obligations under Sections 6.13(d) and
6.18(e) and (iv) the provisions set forth in Sections 6.9 and 8.5 and Article
9, the Confidentiality Agreement (to the extent provided therein) and the
Limited Guaranties (to the extent provided therein) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (x) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.4(b) (or pursuant to Section 8.2(a) at a time
when this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or
Section 8.4(b)), (y) an Acquisition Proposal is made (and, in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or pursuant to Section 8.2(a) at a
time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b),
publicly available) after the date of this Agreement but prior to the date of
the event giving rise to such right of termination and such Acquisition
Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn prior to (1) the date of the event
giving rise to such right of termination (in connection with a termination
pursuant to Section 8.4(b) or pursuant to Section 8.2(a) at a time when this
Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b)) or (2) the
Company Stockholders Meeting (in connection with a termination pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) or pursuant to Section 8.2(a) at a time when this Agreement
was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b)), and (z) prior to or
within 270 days of such termination, the Company enters into any definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition Proposal (in each
case whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (y)) ( _provided_ that for purposes of this clause (b),
the references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%");

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a);

then the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than (A) in the case of
clause (i) above, three business days after the date on which the Company
consummates the Acquisition Proposal or after the date on which the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect thereto, (B) in the case of
clause (ii) above, three business days after the date of such termination and
(C) in the case of clause (iii) above, immediately prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination) pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its
designees the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds (it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion). " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean
an amount equal to $19.0 million (less any Parent Expenses previously paid by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.6). Any Termination Fee paid to Parent or
its designees pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent to the Company for such purpose.

 



69 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c), then Parent shall promptly, but in no
event later than three business days after the date of such termination, pay
or cause to be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds an
amount equal to $45.0 million (the " _Parent Fee_ ") (it being understood
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Fee on more than
one occasion). It is agreed that the Parent Fee is liquidated damages and not
a penalty, and the payment of the Parent Fee in the circumstances specified
herein is supported by due and sufficient consideration.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section
8.6, or if Parent fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section
8.5(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or
Section 8.6, or a judgment against Parent or Merger Sub for any amounts due
pursuant to Section 8.5(c), the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on
the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the
prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date of payment.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
Section 9.12: (i) the Companys right to terminate this Agreement and to
receive the Parent Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5 (and the guarantee
thereof by the Guarantors pursuant to the Limited Guaranties and the
reimbursement obligations of Parent under Section 8.5(d) hereof) shall, upon
full payment to the Company of the Parent Fee, be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Company and its Affiliates against the Guarantors, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Financing Sources or any former, current or future
stockholder, controlling Person, director, officer, employee, general or
limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, affiliated (or commonly advised)
funds, representative, agent and assignee and successor of any of the
foregoing (each, a " _Related Party_ ") for any losses or damages suffered as
a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith (including any Financing Letter) or
the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith, in
each case, in any circumstance in which the Company is permitted to terminate
this Agreement and receive the Parent Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and
upon payment of such amounts if and when due, none of the Guarantors, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Financing Sources or any of their Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions (except that Parent shall remain obligated with
respect to the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent
contained in Sections 6.5(a)(i), 6.13(c), 6.13(d), 6.18(e) and 8.5(d)), the
Limited Guaranties, the Equity Commitment Letters, the Debt Commitment Letter
or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect
of oral representations made or alleged to

 



70  be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; and (ii) in connection with any loss suffered
as a result of any breach of any representation, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect
of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith, in each case, other than in a circumstance in which the Company is
permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent Fee pursuant to
Section 8.5(c), the Company agrees that the maximum aggregate liability of
Parent and Merger Sub to the Company shall be limited to an amount equal to
the amount of the Parent Fee, and in no event shall the Company seek to
recover any money damages in excess of such amount. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, under no circumstances will the Company be
entitled to monetary damages the aggregate amount of which, together with any
portion of the Parent Fee paid to the Company by Parent pursuant to Section
8.5(c), exceeds the amount of the Parent Fee (plus any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 8.5(d)), and in no event shall the Company seek to
recover monetary damages from any Related Party (other than Parent and Merger
Sub and, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Limited Guaranties, the Guarantors). Parents right to terminate this
Agreement and to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b) shall,
upon full payment to Parent of the Termination Fee, be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and their respective Affiliates
against the Company and any of its respective former, current, or future
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives or
agents for any losses or damages suffered as a result of any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of
any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith, in each case, in any circumstance in which Parent is permitted to
terminate this Agreement and receive the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.5(b), and upon payment of such amounts if and when due, none of the Company
or any of its respective former, current, or future stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or representatives shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions (except for any reimbursement and expense obligations of
the Company pursuant to Section 8.5(d) and Section 8.6) or in respect of any
other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and, in such case, the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages and not a penalty (and the payment of the Termination
Fee in the circumstances specified herein is supported by due and sufficient
consideration) for any and all losses and damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Merger Sub and each of their Affiliates and any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger and
the Transactions (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination and none of Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Affiliate
of the Company arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the Transactions (or the abandonment or termination thereof)
or any matters forming the basis of such termination.

Section 8.6 _Parent Expenses_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event of termination of this

 



71  Agreement by (i) either party pursuant to Section 8.2(b) (or a termination
by the Company pursuant to a different section of Section 8.2 at a time when
this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 8.2(b)) or (ii) Parent
pursuant to Section 8.4(b), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event
later than three business days after receipt of an invoice (with supporting
documentation) therefor from Parent, pay Parents designee all of the
reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses
of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging
counterparties, experts and consultants) incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions up to a maximum amount of $2,500,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ "),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided, however, that in
no event shall the Company have any obligation to make any such payment if, at
the time of such termination, this Agreement was terminable by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.3(b).

 

Section 8.7 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to Section 9.5, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, each party may by action taken by its board of directors,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made by any other party
hereto contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
any other party hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 9.3 _Assignment; Binding Effect; Benefit_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may without such consent, assign in writing, directly or
indirectly, their respective rights and obligations hereunder to any of their
respective wholly owned Subsidiaries (provided that no such assignment shall
relieve such parties of their obligations hereunder); _provided_ , _further_
, _however_ , that Parent may assign this Agreement to a newly formed parent
holding company, which will assume all of Parents obligations hereunder,
in connection with Parents reorganization (provided that no such assignment
shall impair or delay the consummation of the Financing, Merger and the other
Transactions or relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement); upon
such assignment by Parent, all references in this Agreement to "Parent" shall
be deemed references to such newly formed parent holding company. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, except for the provisions of Section 6.10 and this Section 9.3,
nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any
Person other than the parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors,
executors and administrators any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (i) the right of the
stockholders of the Company to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration after the Closing (a claim that may not be made unless
and until the Effective Time shall have occurred), (ii) the rights of the
holders of Company Options, Company SARs, Restricted Shares, Company RSUs and
Company PSUs to receive the amounts set forth in and pursuant to Section 3.3
(a claim that may not be made unless and until the Effective Time shall have
occurred) and (iii) the right of the Company to pursue damages in the event of
Parents or Merger Subs willful breach of this Agreement (a claim which shall
be enforceable only by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion),
which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger
Sub. In addition, the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter shall
be considered third party beneficiaries with respect to Sections 8.5(a),
8.5(c), 8.5(d), 8.5(e), 9.3, 9.4, 9.11, 9.13 and 9.14 and the Related Parties
shall be considered third party beneficiaries with respect to Section 8.5(e)
and Section 9.15. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any

 



74  inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.7 without notice or liability
to any Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the

hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect thereto.

Section 9.5 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized by their boards of directors, at any time prior
to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that after the Company
Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made without further stockholder
approval which by law requires further approval by the holders of Shares. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the
parties hereto.

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of
the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the
conflicts of law provisions thereof that would cause the laws of any other
jurisdiction to apply.

Section 9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered

and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies
hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the
parties hereto.

contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of

prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement, to the extent possible, in such a manner as to be
valid, legal and enforceable but so as to retain most nearly the intent of the
parties as expressed herein, and if such a modification is not possible, that
provision will be severed from this Agreement, and all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not
affected in any manner adverse to any party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties hereto intend that the provisions of Article 8 and
Section 9.12, including the remedies and limitations thereon (including
Section 8.5(e)) be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and
that such provisions, remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any
manner that diminishes a partys rights hereunder or increases a partys
liability or obligations hereunder or under the Financing Letters or the
Limited Guaranties.

 

Section 9.12 _Enforcement of Agreement_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
any of the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such

 



78  actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger and the
Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and hereby agree that,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article 8, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company
shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Parents and Merger Subs
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded, including by requiring
Parent and/or Merger Sub to file one or more lawsuits against the Guarantors
to fully enforce the Guarantors obligations under the Equity Commitment
Letters and Parents and/or Merger Subs rights thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such right shall be available if, and only if, (w) all of the
conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which
conditions shall be capable of being satisfied upon the Closing Date) have
been satisfied by the date the Closing is required to have occurred, (x)
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (y) the Debt Financing
provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter has been funded or will be funded
at the Closing, if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (z) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and
the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing
will occur.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company
shall be entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub
to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive
documents therefor, including by requiring Parent and/or Merger Sub to file
one or more lawsuits against the Financing Sources to fully enforce the
Financing Sources obligations thereunder and Parents and/or Merger Subs
rights thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that such right shall be available
if, and only if, (x) all of the conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other
than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date, but each of which conditions shall be capable of being satisfied
on the Closing Date) have been satisfied by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred, (y) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 1.2, and (z) all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt
Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied
(other than receipt of (i) the Equity Financing, (ii) any conditions that are
within the control of Parent or Merger Sub, and (iii) those conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which
conditions referenced in this clause (iii) shall be capable of being satisfied
on the Closing Date).

(d) Each of the parties agrees that it will not raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided herein, including objections on the basis that
(x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or

 



79  equity or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Until such time as Parent pays the Parent Fee, the remedies available to the
Company pursuant to this Section 9.12 shall be in addition to any other remedy
to which it is entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue an
injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise
limit the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate this
Agreement and collect the Parent Fee pursuant to Section 8.5. The parties
hereto further agree that nothing set forth in this Section 9.12 shall require
any party hereto to institute any proceeding for specific performance under
this Section 9.12 prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under Article 8 (and/or receipt of any amounts due pursuant to Section
8.5), nor shall the commencement of any legal action or legal proceeding
pursuant to this Section 9.12 or anything set forth in this Section 9.12
restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Article 8. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages the aggregate
amount of which, together with any portion of the Parent Fee paid to the
Company by Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(c), exceeds the amount of the
Parent Fee (plus any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.5(d)).

Section 9.13 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the parties hereto
(i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if that court declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
Transactions and consents to service of process in the manner provided in
Section 9.2, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement
or any of the Transactions in any court other than such court. The parties
hereby further agree that New York state or United States federal courts
sitting in New York, the borough of Manhattan, City of New York, shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over any action brought against any Financing Source
under the Debt Commitment Letter or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection with the Transactions.

Section 9.14  _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREFOR (INCLUDING IN RESPECT OF THE DEBT FINANCING AND DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER).

 

Section 9.15 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon or under this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this

 



80  Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly
identified as parties hereto and, in accordance with and subject to the terms
and conditions of the Limited Guaranties, the Guarantors, and no Related
Party (other than the Guarantors in accordance with and subject to the terms
and conditions of the Limited Guaranties) shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim
against the parties to this Agreement (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith.
Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the
Company agrees not to and cause its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates
Representatives not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any
claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary
damages from, any Related Party (other than from the Guarantors in accordance
with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Limited
Guaranties).
