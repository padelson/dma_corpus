 **ARTICLE III** ** 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS**

 



 

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such share, a " _Share_ ")
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) Shares
owned by the Company, including Shares held in treasury by the Company, and in
each case not held on behalf of third parties, (iii) Shares owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and (iv) Shares
owned by Dissenting Stockholders (the Shares referred to in the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ , _(ii), (iii)_ and _(iv)_ , collectively, the " _Cancelled
Shares_ ")) shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive $23.85 per share in cash, without interest (the
" _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares that have been converted into a right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.1(a)_ shall no longer be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and extinguished automatically and shall cease
to exist, and each former holder of Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to
be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with this _Article III_.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. At the Effective Time, each Cancelled
Share shall cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without any conversion
thereof or payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist,
subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under _Section 3.4(g)_.

 



 

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

3.2 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to
purchase shares of Common Stock issued under a Company Equity Plan (a "
_Company Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not vested and without any required action on
the part of any Party, the holder of any such Company Option or any other
Person, will be cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into the right
to receive (without interest) at or as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time a cash payment, if any, with respect thereto equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the applicable per
share exercise price under such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Payment of the Option
Consideration shall be net of any applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment (as provided in _Section 3.4(f)_). As of the
Effective Time, all Company Options (whether vested or unvested) shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder
of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Option Consideration, if any. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as
of the Effective Time with a per share

 



     

 

 



 

exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration will, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled without the payment
of any consideration therefor.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Vested Restricted Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (i) each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit that is (A) held by
a non-employee director, whether vested or unvested, (B) vested in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan and award agreement
evidencing such Restricted Stock Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and for which Shares have not yet been issued, or (C) is subject to
accelerated vesting solely as a result of the completion of the Merger in
accordance with the terms thereof and (ii) with respect to each vesting
tranche of all Restricted Stock Units grants that are outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement and that are not covered by clause (i) of this _Section
3.2(b)_, fifty percent (50%) of the total number of such Restricted Stock
Units subject to such vesting tranche (the Restricted Stock Units described in
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , each, a " _Vested Restricted Stock Unit_ "),
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of any Party,
the holder of any such Vested Restricted Stock Unit or any other Person, be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Vested Restricted Stock
Unit to receive (without interest), at or as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to such Vested Restricted Stock Unit immediately
prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). Payment of RSU Consideration
shall be net of any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment (as provided in _Section 3.4(f)_). As of the Effective Time, all
Vested Restricted Stock Units shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Vested Restricted Stock
Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the RSU Consideration in respect thereof in accordance with the terms
of this _Section 3.2(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Unvested Restricted Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit that is not a Vested
Restricted Stock Unit (each, an "Unvested Restricted Stock Unit") shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of any Party, the
holder of any such Unvested Restricted Stock Unit or any other Person, be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Unvested Restricted Stock
Unit to receive the RSU Consideration, which RSU Consideration will vest and
be payable by the Surviving Corporation, subject to the applicable holders
continued employment through such applicable vesting date, without any
interest for the period from the Effective Time until such date, on the
applicable vesting date for such Unvested Restricted Stock Unit (such
applicable vesting date, the " _Restricted Stock Unit Payment Date_ ");
_provided_ , that if the employment of a holder of Unvested Restricted Stock
Units is, following the Effective Time but prior to the applicable Restricted
Stock Unit Payment Date, terminated for any reason other than (i) by Parent or
any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) for Cause or (ii)
by such holder without Good Reason, then the payment of the RSU Consideration
shall be accelerated to the first payroll date after the date of such
termination. For purposes of this _Section 3.2(d)_, the term "applicable
vesting date" means the date that the applicable Unvested Restricted Stock
Unit otherwise would have vested in accordance with its terms. Payment of RSU
Consideration shall be made on the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Payment
Date net of any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. As of the Effective Time, all Unvested Restricted Stock Units shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each
holder of an Unvested Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the RSU Consideration in
respect thereof in accordance with the terms of this _Section 3.2(d)_.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of PSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding PSU shall automatically and without any required action on the
part of any Party, the holder of any such PSU or any other Person, shall be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such PSU to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) (x) for each
outstanding PSU other than the 2019 LTIP PSUs, the maximum number of Shares
subject to such PSU immediately prior to the

 



     

 

 



 

Effective Time, and (y) for each 2019 LTIP PSU, that number of PSUs as is
calculated by assuming that the applicable performance goals for such 2019
LTIP PSU are achieved at 150% of target and then adjusting such number based
on the Companys total shareholder return as measured immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the 2019 LTIP PSUs, in each
case, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (the " _PSU
Consideration_ "), which PSU Consideration will vest and be payable by the
Surviving Corporation, subject to the applicable holders continued employment
through such applicable vesting date, without any interest for the period from
the Effective Time until such date, on the applicable vesting date for such
PSU (with respect to each PSU, such applicable vesting date, the " _PSU
Payment Date_ "); _provided_ , that if the employment of a holder of PSUs is,
following the Effective Time but prior to the applicable PSU Payment Date,
terminated for any reason other than (x) by Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) for Cause or (y) by such holder without
Good Reason, then the payment of the PSU Consideration shall be accelerated to
the first payroll date after the date of such termination. For purposes of
this _Section 3.2(d)_, the term "applicable vesting date" means the date that
the applicable PSU otherwise would have vested in accordance with its terms
(i.e., the first date on which the service vesting requirement is satisfied
with respect to such PSU). Payment of PSU Consideration shall be made on the
PSU Payment Date net of any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. As of the Effective Time, all PSUs shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a PSU
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the PSU Consideration in respect thereof in accordance with the terms
of this _Section 3.2(e)_.

 



 

(e) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. With respect to the Company ESPP, the Company
will take all actions reasonably necessary to provide that:

 



 

(i) participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement
will be limited to those Company Employees who participate in the Company ESPP
as of the date of this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the Company ESPP
as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, participants may not increase
their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the
date of this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) no new offering periods under the Company ESPP will commence during the
Interim Period;

 



 

(iv) on a date determined by the Company Board that is no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, any outstanding "Offering Period"
(as defined in the Company ESPP) that is in progress on such date shall
terminate and be the final Offering Period under the Company ESPP;

 



 

(v) the accumulated payroll deductions of each participant under the Company
ESPP will be used to purchase shares of Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the Company ESPP on the earlier of (A) the scheduled purchase date
for the final Offering Period and (B) the date that is not less than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time (with any participant payroll
contributions not applied to the purchase of such shares returned to the
participant) (the " _Final Purchase Date_ ");

 



 

(vi) the Company ESPP shall terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and

 



      

 

 



 

(vii) any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Company ESPP prior to or
on the Final Purchase Date will be treated as outstanding Shares for purposes
of _Section 3.1_.

 



 

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and use reasonable best efforts to
take any actions which are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(g) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the aggregate amount of the Option Consideration and the RSU Consideration for
the Vested Restricted Stock (in each case, after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 3.4(f)_). As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than the
Surviving Corporations next payroll date that is at least ten (10) Business
Days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company or the
Surviving Corporation to pay the applicable holders of Company Options,
Restricted Stock Units or PSUs that are cancelled and converted pursuant to
_Sections 3.2(a)_ , _3.2(b)_ or _3.2(d)_ , as applicable, all amounts
required to be paid to such holders in respect of such Company Options or
Vested Restricted Stock Units through the Companys or the Surviving
Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company
Options and/or Restricted Stock Units and/or PSUs pursuant to _Sections
3.2(a)_ or _3.2(b)_ , as applicable, cannot be made through the Companys or
the Surviving Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to issue a check for such payment to
such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder
promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event later than the Surviving
Corporations next payroll date that is at least ten (10) Business Days
thereafter).

 



 

3.3 _Treatment of Convertible Notes_.

 



 

(a) In accordance with the terms of the applicable Convertible Notes
Indenture, at or after the Effective Time, each holder of Convertible Notes
will be entitled, subject to the terms and conditions of its applicable
Convertible Notes Indenture, to:

 



 

(i) convert or exchange such holders applicable Convertible Notes only into a
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash for each
$1,000 principal amount of such Convertible Notes held by such holder equal to
the (i) Per Share Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ the applicable
Conversion Rate in effect on the applicable Conversion Date, in each case, for
such Convertible Notes (as may be increased by any Additional Shares (as
defined in the relevant Convertible Notes Indenture) pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the relevant Convertible Notes Indenture);

 



 

(ii) require the Surviving Corporation to repurchase such holders applicable
Convertible Notes (or any portion of principal amount thereof that is equal to
$1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof), for cash on a
date specified by the Company in accordance with the applicable Convertible
Notes Indenture at the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Price (as
defined in the relevant Convertible Notes Indenture); or

 



 

(iii) continue to hold such holders Convertible Notes, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, following the Closing Date shall only be convertible or
exchangeable into cash as set forth in _Section 3.3(a)(i)_ above.

 



 

(b) The Surviving Corporation (directly or through the Paying Agent (as
defined in the relevant Convertible Notes Indenture)) shall satisfy and
fulfill the relevant payment obligations to

 



     

 

 



 

each holder of Convertible Notes described in _Section 3.3(a)(i)_ or
_3.3(a)(ii)_ as and when required by the terms of this Agreement and the
relevant Convertible Notes Indenture (as such Convertible Notes Indenture may
be supplemented in accordance with its terms and _Section 6.14(b)_).

 



 

3.4 _Surrender of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company with a paying agent selected by Parent (which agreement and paying
agent shall be subject to the Companys prior written approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), to act as agent
for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (such paying
agent, the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive payment of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, a cash amount
in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to
provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares)
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in trust
for the benefit of the holders of the Shares that will be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably
directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion,
or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the
Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to
make such cash payments of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
(including in respect of any Shares held by former Dissenting Stockholders as
described in _Section 3.4(g)_). Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under _Article III_ shall be promptly returned
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.4(a)_ shall not
be used for any purpose other than as contemplated by this _Section 3.4(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event no later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each
former holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, if any ("
_Certificates_ "), and each former holder of record of Shares held in book-
entry form, if any (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), (in each case, other than
holders of Cancelled Shares) (A) transmittal materials, including a letter of
transmittal in customary form as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company
prior to the Closing, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only
upon delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book-entry transfer of
Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request), such transmittal materials to be in such
form and

 



     

 

 



 

have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree prior
to the Closing and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of one or more Certificates to the Paying
Agent, in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials and
instructions as contemplated in _Section 3.4(b)(i)_, the holder of record of
such Certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, a cash amount in U.S. dollars in immediately available
funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 3.4(f)_) equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate(s) _multiplied by_ (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates.

 



 

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to
deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation in
order to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) shall
upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (it
being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have
surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such "agents
message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, a cash amount in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
3.4(f)_) equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares represented by such
Book-Entry Shares _multiplied by_ (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, is registered, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, formerly representing such
Shares is properly presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all reasonable
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

 



 

(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.4(b)_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares) shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender (together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as
applicable)) the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this _Article III_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange
of Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former holders of Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any

 



     

 

 



 

holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ (including the terms of
the transmittal materials) shall thereafter be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
3.4(f)_) upon delivery of evidence of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, without any interest
thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section 3.4(b)_, and
Parent shall remain liable for (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) payment of such holders claim for the Per
Share Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of its Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately
prior to such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of all claims of interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any evidence of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented, and
acceptable, to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Article
III_, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately
available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
_Article III_. The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in the
case of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable.

 



 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.4(f))_ equal to the amount the holder of such
Certificate is entitled as set forth in _Section 3.4(b)(ii)_.

 



 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Paying Agent, Parent,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such deducted or
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Paying Agent, Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Authority and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

 



 

(g) _Appraisal Rights_. No stockholder of the Company who has perfected and
not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL (each, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares

 



     

 

 



 

owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such Persons
right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each such Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand
for appraisal under the DGCL, approve any withdrawal of any such demands or
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. If any Dissenting Stockholder
effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
stockholders right to obtain payment for the fair value of such stockholders
Shares under the Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time of the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or
loss, such stockholder shall no longer be a Dissenting Stockholder and such
Dissenting Stockholders Shares shall be treated as if they had, as of the
Effective Time, been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest, as set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_.

 



 

3.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the
number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time shall have been changed into a different number of Shares or
securities or a different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), combination, stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, then, in any such case, the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide to Parent and the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 3.5_ shall be
construed to permit the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other
Person to take any such action except as permitted by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV** ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that,

date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth in the SEC Reports
(A) under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" and (B)
in any other section relating to forward-looking statements, in each case, to
the extent they are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or
(ii) as set forth on the corresponding sections of the disclosure letter
delivered to Parent by the Company concurrently with entering into this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), it being acknowledged and
agreed that disclosure of any item or matter in any section or subsection of

is in

 



     

 

 



 

good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or present conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except, in each case, where the
failure to be so organized, formed, existing, qualified or, to the extent such
concept is applicable, in good standing, or to have such power or authority
has not had, or would not be reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has furnished or otherwise made available to Parent, prior to
the date hereof, a correct and complete copy of the certificate of
incorporation of the Company (as amended to date, the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ ") and the bylaws of the Company (as amended to date, the "

The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws are in full force and effect.

 



 

4.2 _Authorization_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority, and has taken all corporate action necessary, to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, subject only to the
affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of all
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at the
Stockholders Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, to adopt
this Agreement (the " _Company Requisite Vote_ ") and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent
and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to the effects of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ "). The Company
Board, at a duly called and held meeting, has (a) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Companys
stockholders, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement, (c) subject to the
terms of this Agreement, resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger (the "
_Recommendation_ ") and (d) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company for their consideration and adoption. The only
vote of the stockholders of the Company required to approve this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby is the Company Requisite Vote.

 



 

4.3 _No Conflicts; Governmental Approvals_.

filings described in _Section 4.3(b)_ have been made and the Company
Requisite Vote has been obtained, conflict with, breach or violate any Law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties or
assets are bound or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default), require a consent or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of,
or result in the creation of a Lien (except a Permitted Lien) on any of the
assets of the Company pursuant to, any Material Contract, except, in the case
of the foregoing _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for any such conflict,
violation, breach, default, loss, right or other occurrence which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, and, in each case, other than as may arise in connection with
facts and circumstances particular to Parent and its Affiliates.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby by the Company do not and will not require any consent, approval,

Governmental Authority, except for (i) compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act (including the filing of the Proxy

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company and (B) have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(g) No Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of the Company.

 



 

4.5 _Subsidiaries_. The Company or one of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries owns

payable) to, or make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Person (other than Subsidiaries of the
Company).

filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished by
the Company with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, if any,
including any amendments or supplements thereof, the " _SEC Reports_ "). At
the time it was filed or furnished (or, if amended or superseded by a filing

to the last sentence of _Section 4.18_, contain any untrue statement of a

filed with the SEC, and prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of its executive officers has received written notice from any
Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness,
form or manner of filing such certifications. For purposes of this _Section
4.6(e)_, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" have
the meanings given to such terms in SOX.

 



 

(f) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes, including to provide reasonable assurance that: (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) access to
assets that could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements
is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared

submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is

allegation of fraud that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in its internal control over financial reporting. Since the
Applicable Date, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any material written complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or their
respective internal accounting controls, or any related material allegation
regarding management or other employees who have a significant role in the

leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except, in each case, where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or, to the extent such concept is applicable, in such
good standing, or to have such power or authority, has not had, or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has furnished or otherwise made available to
the Company prior to the date hereof, a complete and correct copy of the

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger
as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization,

of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 



 

5.3 _No Conflicts; Governmental Approvals_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby by each of Parent and Merger Sub do not and
will not require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by,

5.6 _Operations and Ownership of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of
Merger Sub consists solely of 5,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at and immediately prior

expressly contemplated herein or in any other document related to this
transaction and (ii) liabilities and obligations incidental to its formation
and the maintenance of its existence.

 



 

5.7 _Sufficient Funds; Financing_. Parent and Merger Sub on the Closing Date
will have sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of
immediately available funds to make the Closing Date Payments. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub agrees and affirms that is it not a condition to the Closing or
to any of its obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby) that Parent or Merger Sub
obtain any financing for, or related to, any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and
correct copy of the senior facilities agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019
between, among others, Parent and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International
Designated Activity Company, Credit Suisse International, J.P. Morgan
Securities PLC and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as agent (other than Parent,
the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ") (including all exhibits, schedules and
annexes thereto, and any executed fee letter associated therewith redacted in
a manner as described below, collectively, the " _Debt Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which the Debt Financing Sources have committed, subject only to the
satisfaction of the terms and conditions set forth therein (the " _Debt
Financing Conditions_ "), to provide debt financing to Parent and Merger Sub
in the aggregate amounts set forth therein (the " _Financing_ ") for the
purposes of funding the Closing Date Payments. The Debt Agreement has not been
amended,

 



     

 

 



 

supplemented or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and as of the
date of this Agreement, the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Agreement have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect and
no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is pending. Except for any fee
letter referred to above (a complete copy of which has been provided to the
Company, with only fee amounts and the economic terms related to any market
flex provisions contained therein redacted in a customary manner ( _provided_
that Parent represents and warrants that the redactions in any such fee
letters do not relate to the imposition of any new conditions (or the
modification or expansion of any existing Debt Financing Conditions) with
respect to the Financing, any reduction in the amount of the Financing or
otherwise relate to the termination or enforceability or availability of the
Financing)) and customary engagement letters with respect to the Financing,
there are no side letters or Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates is a party related to the provision, funding or investing, as
applicable, of the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby other
than as expressly set forth in the Debt Agreement delivered to the Company
prior to the date hereof. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Debt Agreement that are payable on or prior
to the date hereof and Parent will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in
full any such amounts required to be paid as and when they become due and
payable on or prior to the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, the Debt
Agreement is in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent, and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of
the other parties thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and
Parent is not aware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that
would or would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or any of
the statements set forth in the Debt Agreement inaccurate or that would or
would reasonably be expected to cause the Debt Agreement to be ineffective.
There are no conditions or other contingencies related to the provision,
funding or investing of the full amount of the Financing (including pursuant
to any market flex provisions in the fee letter or otherwise), other than the
Debt Financing Conditions as expressly set forth in the Debt Agreement
delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under
the Debt Agreement, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a Debt Financing
Condition on the part of Parent or any other party thereto under the Debt
Agreement or (iii) result in any portion of the amounts to be provided, funded
or invested in accordance with the Debt Agreement being unavailable on the
Closing Date. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any
of the Debt Financing Conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Debt
Agreement will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will
not be made available to Parent in full on the Closing Date, and, as of the
date hereof, Parent is not aware of the existence of any fact or event that
would or would reasonably be expected to cause such Debt Financing Conditions
not to be satisfied or the full amount of the Financing not to be made
available to Parent in full on the Closing Date. When funded in accordance
with the Debt Agreement, the net proceeds of the Financing contemplated by the
Debt Agreement, together with cash (including any Additional Financing
Proceeds), available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available
funds of Parent will, in the aggregate, provide funds to Parent sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the making of all
Closing Date Payments.

 



 

5.8 _Ownership of Shares_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries beneficially owns (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Shares or Company Securities or any other
securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
Shares, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Shares, or any option
warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, swap agreement or
other security, contract right or derivative position, whether or not
presently exercisable, that provides Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries with an exercise or conversion privilege
or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the value of the
Shares or a value determined in whole or part with reference to, or derived in
whole or part from, the value of the Shares, in any case without regard to
whether (a) such derivative conveys any voting rights in such securities to
such Person or such Persons Affiliates, (b) such derivative

 



     

 

 



 

is required to be, or capable of being, settled through delivery of securities
or (c) such Person or such Persons Affiliates may have entered into other
transactions that hedge the economic effect of such derivative.

 



 

5.9 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
or on behalf of each of Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation

supplement thereto) is first filed with the SEC, or at the time it is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Parent and
Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to any information
in the Proxy Statement, or statement made in the Proxy Statement based on
information, in either case, supplied by the Company or any of its
Representatives which is contained or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement.

 



 

5.10 _Certain Arrangements_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates (including any
Representatives of the foregoing) has entered into any contract, commitment,
agreement, instrument, obligation, arrangement, understanding or undertaking,
whether written or oral, or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any
with any contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation, arrangement,
understanding or undertaking, whether written or oral, with any stockholder of
the Company or any member of the Companys management or directors that is
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an opportunity to discuss the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the management of the
Company, (b) has had reasonable access to (i) the books and records of the

contemplated hereby, and has not relied on any representation, warranty or
other statement by any Person on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than the specific representations and warranties of the
Company expressly contained in _Article IV_ and that any and all other
representations and warranties (express or implied) are specifically
disclaimed. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub
further acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or any of its
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
other Representatives or any other Person has made any representation or
warranty concerning any estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans or
other forward-looking information regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses and operations. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
develop such estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other
forward-looking information with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar,
that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking
information), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the
Company or any of its stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives or any other Person with
respect thereto.

 



 

5.12 _No Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other
similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement of

 



     

 

 



 

expenses, for which the Company will be liable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
and on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

this Agreement shall give or be deemed to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (ii) prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over their respective operations and (iii) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Parent or
Merger Sub shall be required with respect to any matter set forth in this
_Section 6.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent the requirement of
such consent would violate any Law. The failure of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any actions prohibited by this _Section 6.1_ shall not
be a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that, during the Interim
Period, it shall not (and shall cause each of its controlled Affiliates not
to), directly or indirectly, take any action (including any action with
respect to a third party) that, in either case, would, or would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or their respective ability to satisfy their
obligations hereunder.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.1,_ any
covenant of the Company to cause its Subsidiaries to take or refrain from
taking any actions hereunder shall, with respect to its Subsidiaries listed on
Section 6.1(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (" _Non-Controlled
Subsidiary_ "), be deemed to be a covenant of the Company to use reasonable
best efforts to cause such Non-Controlled Subsidiary to take or refrain from
taking such action, which efforts shall be limited to the exercise of
management, voting, consent or similar rights available to the Company or any
other Subsidiary of the Company under any existing organizational document or
other Contract with respect to the ownership interest in such Non-Controlled
Subsidiary.

 



 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
subject to _Section 6.5(b)_, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of
their properties, offices, books, personnel and records. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this _Section 6.2_ to provide
Parent or its Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i)
that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the
date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (ii) the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to violate
or conflict with any Law, including Antitrust Laws, (iii) that is subject to
any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege or (iv)
that would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of the Company or any
third parties; _provided_ , that in the case of each of _clauses (i)_,
_(iii)_ and _(iv)_ , to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to develop an
alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that
is reasonably acceptable to Parent. Parent will reasonably minimize any
disruption to the businesses of the Company that may result from the requests
for access, data and information hereunder. During the

 



      

 

 



 

Interim Period, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any right to perform
invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties or facilities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent may be withheld for any or no reason). Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and
against all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties that may be incurred by any of them arising
out of or related to the provision of the access rights described in this
_Section 6.2_, including the use, storage or handling of any personally
identifiable information relating to employees, suppliers or customers or
other business relationships of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) The Company may elect to limit, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to limit,
disclosure of any information to certain Persons designated, at the request of
the Company, as a "clean team" of Parent (which Persons must be acceptable to
the Company), and materials provided pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and
the Merger and other confidential information, (ii) to remove pricing
information or other information deemed competitively sensitive by outside
counsel to the Company, (iii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (iv) as necessary to address privilege concerns. Without
limiting the terms of _Section 6.5(b)_, Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ in confidence to the
extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

6.3 _Consents_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use (and the
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to use) their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals set forth on Section
6.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) no
party shall be obligated to, and the Company shall not be obligated to cause
its Subsidiaries to, pay any (i) fees, costs or expenses in connection
therewith (other than immaterial administrative or legal costs and expenses)
or (ii) consideration to any third party from whom any such consent or
approval is requested under any Contract and (b) the consent of Parent shall
be required with respect to any amendment or modification to any Contract for
the purposes of obtaining any such consent or approval that is adverse in any
material respect to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing; _provided further_ , that each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that obtaining any such consent or approval shall not
be a condition to Closing.

 



 

6.4 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.3_, without limiting any other covenant in this
Agreement (including the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
this _Section 6.4_ and _Section 6.12_), each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, agrees to use its respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do,
or cause to be done as promptly as practicable, all things necessary, proper
and advisable under applicable Laws to (i) consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to appropriate confidentiality
protections, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other, shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Each Party will use its best efforts to, and, in the case of Parent, cause
each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Group_ ")
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting

 



     

 

 



 

the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, each of
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
shall provide or cause to be provided (including by (i) their "ultimate parent
entities" as that term is defined in the HSR Act and (ii) their other
Affiliates) as promptly as practicable to any applicable Governmental
Authority information and documents requested by such Governmental Authority
or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) filing any notification and
report form and related material required under the HSR Act no later than ten
(10) Business Days after the date hereof, (ii) filing information and
documents required under any other Antitrust Law enforced by any Governmental
Authority regarding pre-acquisition notifications for the purpose of
competition reviews as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and, in each case, thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable
to any request for additional information or documentary material that may be
made under the HSR Act (and any other Antitrust Law enforced by any
Governmental Authority regarding preacquisition notifications for the purpose
of competition reviews), (iii) making a draft joint voluntary notice to CFIUS
in accordance with the DPA as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, (iv) making a final joint voluntary notice to CFIUS in accordance
with the DPA as promptly as practicable after receipt of confirmation that
CFIUS has no further comment to the draft filing, and (v) as promptly as
practicable providing any information requested by CFIUS or its member
agencies in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and in any event within the
timeframes set forth in the DPA as extended, if applicable. Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause (and shall cause its "ultimate parent entity"
as that term is defined in the HSR Act to cause) the filings under the HSR Act
to be considered for grant of "early termination," and make any further
filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or advisable in
connection therewith. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, on more than one
occasion, "pull-and-refile" pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12 any filing made under
the HSR Act or take any similar action with respect to any filing made with,
or notice to (including the joint voluntary notice to CFIUS), any Governmental
Authority, in each case, without prior written approval from the Company.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section
6.4(b)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations or expiration of
waiting periods for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law or in order to obtain CFIUS Clearance (as
applicable), (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) subject
to applicable Law, furnish to the other Party as promptly as reasonably
practicable all information reasonably required for any application or other
filing to be made by the other Party pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii)
promptly notify the other Party of any written or substantive oral
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), CFIUS or its member agencies or any
other U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority and of any written or substantive
oral communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private Party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and, subject to applicable Law, furnish the other Party promptly with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications between such Party
and the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS or its member agencies, or any other Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(excluding personal identifier information and any internal documents
submitted with any application or other filing made pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Law, and with due regard for customary information
exchange protocols); (iv) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
inquiries received from, and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information or documentation that may be requested by the DOJ, FTC,
CFIUS or its member agencies, or by any other Governmental Authority in
respect of such registrations, declarations and filings or such transactions,
and in any event when applicable within the timeframes set forth in the DPA as
extended, if applicable; and (v) consult with each

 



     

 

 



 

other reasonably in advance, and consider in good faith the other Partys
reasonable comments in connection with, any communication, meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS or its member agencies, or any other
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person. No Party shall independently participate in any
meeting or communication with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry relating to _Sections 6.4(b)_ or _6.4(c)_
without giving the other Parties sufficient and reasonable prior notice of
the meeting to the extent practicable and, to the extent practicable and
permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate in such meeting or communication; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the requirements of this provision shall not apply to any portion of a meeting
or discussion between Parent or its Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, solely to the extent such a meeting
or communication relates only to Parent confidential business information.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall, on
behalf of the Parties, control and direct all communications and strategy in
dealing with any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws, or in connection with CFIUS or any of its member agencies; _provided_
that Parent shall consider in good faith the views and comments of the Company
and its outside counsel with respect to such communications and strategies.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, take any and all steps
necessary to (i) resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if
any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under any Antitrust Law or in order to obtain CFIUS Clearance
and (ii) avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution of, and, except if issued
pursuant to the DPA, have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree,
order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the contemplated transactions, in each case, so as to enable
the Parties to close the contemplated transactions as expeditiously as
practicable (but in no event later than the Outside Date), including (A)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition, or license
of any assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses
(collectively " _Assets_ ") of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any interest
therein, (B) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that would limit
Parents, Parents Subsidiaries, Parents Affiliates, or the Companys or its
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain any Assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any interest or
interests therein, and (C) providing assurances of continuing supply of
products directly or indirectly to the United States Government (the matters
described in this sentence, individually and collectively, " _Remedy Actions_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
no event shall anything in this Agreement require, or be construed to require,
Parent or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries to take, or propose or agree to take,
any Remedy Actions (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take, or
agree to take, any Remedy Actions, without the prior written consent of
Parent) (1) that, individually or in the aggregate with all other Remedy
Actions, would, or would be reasonably expected to, have a material adverse
effect on the business, results of operations, assets or financial condition
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) with respect to
Parents or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries Assets (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time).

 



 

(e) Subject to the obligations under _Section 6.4(d)_, in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority (other than CFIUS or any of its
member agencies) or private party challenging the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement
contemplated hereby, (i) each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and
Parent shall cause each member of the Parent Group to, cooperate in all
respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or

 



     

 

 



 

overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company must defend, at their cost and
expense, any action or actions, whether judicial or administrative, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) From the date of this Agreement through the date (i) of termination of the
required waiting periods under the HSR Act and all applicable Antitrust Laws,
(ii) all approvals under applicable Antitrust Laws are obtained and (iii) the
consents required pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ are obtained, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates shall acquire or agree to acquire,
by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of
the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or
equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to: (A) hinder or delay, as applicable, the obtaining
of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting periods under the HSR
Act, obtaining the approvals required under other such applicable Antitrust
Laws, obtaining of the consents or clearances required pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_, or any consents or clearances of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B)
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority seeking or entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (C) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order
on appeal or otherwise.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, commercially and/or
competitively sensitive information and materials of a Party may, at the
election of a providing Party, be provided to the other Party on an outside
antitrust or CFIUS counsel-only basis while, to the extent feasible and
reasonable, making a version in which the commercial and/or competitively
sensitive information has been redacted available to the other Party.

 



 

6.5 _Publicity; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press
release of the Parties. Except in connection with (i) a Change of
Recommendation or an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any dispute between or among
the Parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or (iii) a press release or other public statement that is (A) consistent in
all material respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by a Party in accordance with this Agreement, including
in investor conference calls, SEC filings, QandAs or other publicly disclosed
documents, in each case, to the extent such disclosure is still accurate,
thereafter or (B) as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Authority
(or, in the case of the Company, by the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
as reasonably determined by the Company Board or, in the case of Parent, by
the fiduciary duties of the Management Board of Parent as reasonably
determined by the Management Board of Parent), in each case, as determined in
the good faith judgment of the Party proposing to make such release, unless a
Change of Recommendation has occurred, the Company and Parent shall consult
with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority (including any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the Company may, without any consultation
with Parent, make communications in support of the Merger and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby and solicit proxies from the Companys
stockholders and (2) Parent and the Company may make public statements in
response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry

 



     

 

 



 

conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements in _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ consist solely of information
previously disclosed in all material respects and consistent in all material
respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made by a Party in accordance with this Agreement, in each case, to the extent
such disclosure is still accurate at the time of such statement.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will comply with the terms and conditions of
the letter agreement, dated April 30, 2019, between the Company and Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and will hold and treat, and will cause

the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended, as applicable, to permit the
inclusion of all potential sources of equity, debt or other financing in the
term "Representatives" as such term is defined therein, and (ii) any explicit
or implicit lockup or standstill restrictions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be terminated as of the date of this Agreement.

described in _clauses (C)_ , _(D)_ , _(E)_ , _(F), (G)_ , _(H)_ or this
_clause (I)_ (to the extent related to the actions described in the forgoing
_clauses (C)_ , _(D)_ , _(E)_ , _(F)_ , _(G)_ or _(H)_ ), a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that it is understood and agreed
that any determination or action by the Company Board to the extent permitted
under _Section 6.6(b)_, _Section 6.6(c)_ or _Section 6.6(d)_ shall not be,
and shall not be deemed to be, a breach or violation of this _Section 6.6(a)_
or, in the case of _Section 6.6(b)_, unless a Change of Recommendation has
occurred, give Parent a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)(ii)_.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall direct
its and their Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the Parties and their
respective Representatives) in connection with any proposal or offer that
would constitute, or reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, in each case, that exist as of the date hereof, and immediately
terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to
any such Person or its Representatives. The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person (other than the Parties and their respective
Representatives) that has prior to the date hereof executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company to
return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof
and in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may grant a
waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement
solely to the extent (A) necessary to allow for a confidential Acquisition
Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board and (B) the Company
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to grant such waiver, amendment or release would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(iii) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours of the Companys Knowledge of any such event) notify
Parent if (A) any expressions of interest, proposals or offers with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal are received by, (B) any non-public information is
requested to facilitate a proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal from, or (C) any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives from any Person (other than Parent) with respect to any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, including in such notification a copy (if in
writing) of documents or written summary of material terms (if oral) relating
to such expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information,
and the identity of the Person from which such expression of interest,
proposal, offer or request for information was received. Except as provided in
_Section 6.6(d)_, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
prompt basis of the status and material terms of any such expressions of
interest, proposals or offers (including any copies (if in writing) of
documents or written summaries of material terms (if oral) of any proposed
agreements and amendments or modifications thereto, and a copy of any other
documents provided by the relevant counterparty relating thereto) and the
status of any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal,
and in the case of any material modification to the terms of any Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall notify Parent of such material modification on a
prompt basis (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives
knowledge of any such material modification (such period to be reduced to
twenty-four (24) hours in the event of any modification to price)).

 



 

(b) _Certain Exceptions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
6.6(a)_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent or restrict the
Company or the Company Board from:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) (A) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer) or (B) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of
the Company); _provided_ that, any such disclosure referred to in the
preceding _clauses (A)_ or _(B)_ that involves an Acquisition Proposal shall
be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms
the Recommendation in such disclosure;

 



 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting any Person or
group and their respective Representatives who has made an Acquisition
Proposal once and solely to ask questions to clarify (and not to negotiate or
engage in any discussions) the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, providing access to the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries properties, books and records and
providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person or group
who has made an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of this _Section 6.6_ if the Company Board (A) shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior Proposal
and (B) has received from the Person so requesting such information an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company
shall promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information
that is provided to any Person given such access that was not previously made
available to Parent or Merger Sub;

 



 

(iv) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, engaging in any
negotiations or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal and any changes
thereto with any Person or group, and their respective Representatives and its
potential sources of financing, who has made an Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of this _Section 6.6_ (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, such negotiations or discussions need not be solely for
clarification purposes) if the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be
expected to constitute, result in or lead to a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(v) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, making a Change of
Recommendation to the extent permitted under _Section 6.6(c)_ or _Section
6.6(d)_; or

 



 

(vi) resolving or agreeing to take any of the foregoing actions, to the extent
such actions would be permitted by the foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(v)_.

 



 

(c) _Intervening Events_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may
in response to an Intervening Event take the actions described in _clause
(E)_ (or _clause I_ to the extent relating thereto) of the definition of
"Change of Recommendation" if:

 



 

(i) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel that an Intervening Event has occurred and
that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation would reasonably be
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a " _Company Intervening
Event Notice_ "), at least four (4) Business Days in advance, advising Parent
of such determination under _Section 6.6(c)(i)_, which Company Intervening
Event Notice shall include a description of the Intervening Event in
reasonable detail ( _provided_ that the giving of such Company Intervening
Event Notice and actions of the Company Board in authorizing and disclosing
(to the extent legally required) such notice shall not in themselves
constitute a Change of Recommendation); and

 



 

(iii) at or after 11:59 p.m. San Jose, California time, on the fourth Business
Day immediately following the date the Company Intervening Event Notice is
delivered to Parent (such period of time, the " _Intervening Event Notice
Period_ "), the Company Board again makes a determination described under
_Section 6.6(c)(i)_ after (A) if requested by Parent, the Company made its
Representatives reasonably available during the Intervening Event Notice
Period for the purpose of engaging in discussions and negotiations with Parent
and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
a possible amendment to this Agreement and (B) taking into account in good
faith any written proposals made by Parent during the Intervening Event Notice
Period, if any, that if accepted by the Company would become binding on
Parent.

 



 

(d) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may
in response to its receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from
a material breach of this _Section 6.6_ (x) make a Change of Recommendation
(other than the actions described in _clause (D)_ of the definition of Change
of Recommendation) or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such
Acquisition Proposal if:

 



 

(i) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result in a Superior Proposal and
(B) the failure to make such Change of Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive written
agreement providing for such Acquisition Proposal, as the case may be, would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law ( _provided_ that the actions of the Company Board in making
such determination and such determination shall not in themselves constitute a
Change of Recommendation or a termination of this Agreement);

 



 

(ii) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ")
at least four (4) Business Days in advance advising Parent of such
determination under _Section 6.6(d)(i)_, which Company Notice shall specify
the identity of the party making a Superior Proposal and the material terms
and conditions thereof and include an unredacted copy of the Superior Proposal
and any proposed draft Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior
Proposal and any related documents, including financing documents, to the
extent provided by the relevant party in connection with the Superior Proposal
( _provided_ that the giving of a Company Notice and actions of the Company
Board in authorizing and disclosing (to the extent legally required) such
notice shall not in themselves constitute a Change of Recommendation or a
termination of this Agreement); and

 



 

(iii) at or after 11:59 p.m. San Jose, California time, on the fourth Business
Day immediately following the date the Company Notice is delivered to Parent
(such period of time, the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company Board again makes
a determination described under _Section 6.6(d)(i)_ after (A) if requested by
Parent, the Company made its Representatives reasonably available during the
Notice Period for the purpose of engaging in discussions and negotiations with
Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
regarding a possible amendment to this Agreement and (B) taking into account
in good faith any written proposals made by Parent during the Notice Period,
if any, that if accepted by the Company would become binding on Parent;
_provided_ that if,

 



     

 

 



 

following the date the Company Notice is delivered but prior to the Company
Board making a Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, the financial or other material terms of the
relevant Acquisition Proposal are materially amended or modified, then the
Company will deliver to Parent a new Company Notice pursuant to _Section
6.6(d)(ii)_, except that the Notice Period with respect to such new Company
Notice for the purposes of this _Section 6.6(d)(iii)_ shall instead end at
11:59 p.m. San Jose, California time, on the second Business Day immediately
following the date such new Company Notice is delivered to Parent (but no such
new Company Notice will shorten the initial Notice Period).

 



 

6.7 _Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare and file with
the SEC, promptly after the date of this Agreement (and no later than thirty
(30) days after the date hereof), the Proxy Statement. Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Unless the Company Board has made a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Recommendation shall be
included in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto), or any dissemination thereof to the
stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments from the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and to comment on such document or response
(except to the extent of any disclosures in such document or response relate
to an Acquisition Proposal), which comments, if any, the Company shall
consider in good faith. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the
Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond to and resolve all SEC comments with respect to the
Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. Within ten
(10) calendar days after the date of this Agreement (and thereafter as
reasonably determined by the Company in consultation with Parent), the Company
shall conduct a "broker search" in accordance with Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange
Act for a record date for the Stockholders Meeting that is twenty (20)
Business Days after the date of such "broker search." The Company shall cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of Common Stock as of the record
date established for the Stockholders Meeting promptly (but in any event no
more than five (5) Business Days) after the date on which the SEC confirms
that it will not review the Proxy Statement or that it has no further comments
on the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(c) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be
discovered by a Party, which information should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and the Company shall
prepare (with the reasonable assistance and cooperation of Parent) and mail to
its stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to the extent
required by applicable Law. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees
to promptly (i) correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information
provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any
information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the
Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company further agrees to cause

 



     

 

 



 

the Proxy Statement as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to its stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. For the purposes of this _Section 6.7_,
any information concerning the Company or its Affiliates will be deemed to
have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning Parent or
its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent and/or Merger
Sub.

 



 

6.8 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors
(or a committee thereof), shall take all action reasonably required under the
DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the applicable
requirements of NASDAQ necessary to duly establish a record date for, call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose
of adopting this Agreement and the Merger (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as
practicable following confirmation by the SEC that the SEC will not review the
Proxy Statement or that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (but
subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.8_); _provided_ that the
Company may postpone, recess, adjourn or cancel such meeting (a) to the extent
required by Law, fiduciary duty or a request from the SEC or its staff, (b) to
allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent
the Company reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Company
Requisite Vote, (c) if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders
Meeting, (d) in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel), the failure to adjourn, postpone
or delay the Stockholders Meeting would be reasonably likely to not allow
sufficient time under applicable Laws for the distribution of any required or
appropriate supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or (e) Parent
otherwise provides written consent to such postponements or adjournment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, to
the extent permitted by Law, adjourn the Stockholders Meeting to a date
specified by Parent for the absence of a quorum or if the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the
Company Requisite Vote; _provided_ that no such adjournment pursuant to this
sentence shall be required to be for a period exceeding ten (10) Business
Days. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors (or a committee
thereof), shall, subject to _Sections 6.6(b)(v)_ , _6.6(c)_ and _6.6(d)_ ,
(i) include in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote. The adoption of
this Agreement, the adjournment or postponement of the Stockholders Meeting
due to the absence of a quorum or if the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Company Requisite
Vote, and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under
the Exchange Act shall be the only matters which the Company shall propose to
be acted on by the Companys stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting unless
otherwise approved in writing by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to
hold the Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is terminated.

 



 

6.9 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of
NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from
NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after (and only after) the Effective Time
and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

 



 

6.10 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time
(the " _Benefit Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Company or

 



      

 

 



 

the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), an
annual base salary or wage rate, a short term incentive opportunity, employee
pension, welfare and other benefits (including any equity or equity-based
compensation or benefits but excluding any defined benefit pension,
nonqualified deferred compensation, post-service or retiree health or welfare
benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary or
wage rate, short term incentive opportunity, employee pension, welfare and
other benefits that were provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the annual base
salary or wage rate of any Continuing Employee will not be reduced during the
Benefit Continuation Period below the annual base salary or wage rate
applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time. For the duration of the Benefit Continuation Period, Parent or one of
its Affiliates shall maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee a
severance or termination arrangement no less favorable than the severance or
termination arrangement applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall honor and assume, or shall cause to be honored and assumed,
the terms of all Company Plans, subject to the amendment and termination
provisions thereof.

 



 

(c) To the extent that Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in which
Continuing Employees participate during the Benefit Continuation Period,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and any
Subsidiaries thereof) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive
or cause to be waived any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, limitations,
actively-at-work requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group
health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing
Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses
incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made, and
(iii) to the extent that it would not result in a duplication of benefits and
to the extent that such service was recognized under a similar Company Plan,
give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees
employment with the Company for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting credit (but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension or retiree medical plan) under each applicable Parent benefit plan as
if such service had been performed with Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such recognition of service shall not apply (A) for purposes of any Parent
benefit plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, (B) to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation for the same period
of service, or (C) for purposes of any plan or arrangement that is
grandfathered or frozen, or under any equity or equity-based plan or
arrangement or long term incentive compensation plan, either with respect to
the level of benefits or participation.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Agreement_ shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or
any other Person any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any Affiliate of Parent or any particular term or
condition of employment or service, or shall interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee or any other Person at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall (i) be
deemed or construed to be an establishment, termination, amendment or other
modification of any Company Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, Contract or arrangement, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from establishing, amending or
terminating any Company Plans or any other benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement in accordance with their
terms or (iii) create any third-party rights in any current or former service
provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof) or any other Person other than the Parties.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall fully and
timely satisfy all legal or contractual requirements to provide notice to,
inform, bargain with, or to enter into any consultation procedure with, any
labor union, labor organization or works council, which is representing any
Company Employee, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

6.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative and whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ "),
arising out of, relating to or in connection with matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the fact that such
Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to
the Effective Time), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under the Laws of the State of Delaware and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses); _provided_ that, to the extent
required under such Laws of the State of Delaware, the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification)
incurred in the defense of any Proceeding, including any expenses incurred in
enforcing such Persons rights under this _Section 6.11_. In the event of any
such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of or related to such
Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing and (y) the
Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such
matter.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate, and shall
use reasonable best efforts cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in
the defense of any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim or Proceeding of any kind that is subject to advancement of expenses,
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, and shall provide access to
properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be
furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) The provisions in the Surviving Corporations and each of its
Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other similar governing
or constituent documents and instruments with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers shall be no less favorable to such directors and officers than such
provisions contained in the Companys or such Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and other similar governing or constituent documents and
instruments in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed, restated or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 



 

(d) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six (6)
years following the Effective Time, the current policies of the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by

 



     

 

 



 

the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Existing Policies_ ") ( _provided_
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage, with deductibles no larger than in the Existing
Policies and containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous
to any beneficiary thereof, and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay in the aggregate for such
coverage under such policies more than 300% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto under each such policy, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount) with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and from insurance
carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance. At the Companys option, the Company may
purchase from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, no later than
the Effective Time, a six (6) year prepaid "tail policy" providing at least
the same coverage and amounts, with deductibles no larger than in the Existing
Policies and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
the insured than the Existing Policies maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or before the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated
hereby, and from insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay in the aggregate for such coverage under such policies more than 300% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in
respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto under each
such policy, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for
such amount. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy",
the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder. Parent agrees to
honor and perform under, and to cause the Surviving Corporation and each of
its Subsidiaries to honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Indemnified
Party.

 



 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates, restructures, recapitalizes, merges
with or into any other Person or otherwise reorganizes and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation,
restructuring, recapitalization, merger or other restructuring or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.11_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws or similar governing or constituent documents and instruments of
any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. Nothing in
this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive
or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its or their directors, officers, employees or agents, it
being understood that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.11_
is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

 



 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall survive the Merger and,
following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.11_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies
without the consent of the affected Indemnified Party (it being

 



     

 

 



 

expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.11_).

 



 

6.12 _Financing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable prior to the Outside Date to obtain the
Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to (a) maintain in effect
the Debt Agreement, (b) satisfy on a timely basis all Debt Financing
Conditions that are within the control of Parent and its Affiliates in the
Debt Agreement, (c) enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Agreement, if any, including to require such parties to provide the Financing
and (d) consummate the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice
of any Financing Failure Event by any party to the Debt Agreement of which
Parent or its Affiliates becomes aware. Without limiting Parents other
obligations under this _Section 6.12_, if a Financing Failure Event occurs,
then Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such Financing Failure
Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) obtain alternative financing from
alternative financing sources, in an amount sufficient to make the Closing
Date Payments and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable to Parent or its Affiliates (taking
into account any flex provisions) than the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt Agreement and any fee letter, as applicable, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event and in no event later than
the date the Closing is required to occur hereunder and (iii) obtain, and when
obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, any new financing commitment
that provides for such alternative financing; _provided_ , in the case of each
of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , that such actions shall be required from
Parent only to the extent any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable as
a result of such Financing Failure Event and such unavailability would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Parent and Merger
Sub to make the Closing Date Payments on the Closing Date. Neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign,
substitute or replace the Debt Agreement except (A) for substitutions and
replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence (or the last
sentence of this _Section 6.12_), (B) any amendment, modification,
supplement, restatement, substitution or replacement that (1) does not add new
(or otherwise expand, amend or modify any existing) Debt Financing Condition,
(2) does not adversely affect in any material respect the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to enforce its rights against other parties thereto and (3) could
not otherwise be reasonably expected to prevent, impede or delay in any
material respect the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated herein; or (C) with the prior written consent of the Company. As
applicable, references in this Agreement (other than with respect to
representations in this Agreement made by Parent that speak as of the date
hereof) (I) to "Financing" shall include any alternative or modified financing
contemplated by this paragraph and (II) to "Debt Agreement" shall include any
commitment letter or definitive financing agreement relating to such
alternative or modified financing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Parent shall be permitted to reduce commitments under the Debt
Agreement in respect of an amount equal to the actual net cash proceeds
received by Parent prior to the Closing Date from (x) the issuance of new
shares by Parent or its Subsidiaries pursuant to any capital increase of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) any other debt or equity issuance or
asset disposition undertaken by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (such
net cash proceeds, the " _Additional Financing Proceeds_ "); _provided_ that
(aa) Parent will not use the amount of such Additional Financing Proceeds for
any purposes other than making the Closing Date Payments and (bb) the
Additional Financing Proceeds together with the remaining net proceeds of the
Financing contemplated by the Debt Agreement, together with cash, available
lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds of Parent
will, in the aggregate, provide funds to Parent sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the making of all Closing Date
Payments on the Closing Date.

 



     

 

 



 

6.13 _Financing Assistance_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, provide such
cooperation in connection with the Financing (which term, for purposes of this
Section 6.13, shall include any alternate financing, including any debt or
equity securities issued in lieu of the Financing) as is necessary, customary
and reasonably requested by Parent, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) furnish Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable, all
historical financial and other customary information relating to the Company
to Parent to the extent reasonably requested by Parent and (ii) obtain
customary draft comfort letters from the Companys independent public
accounting firm, which accountants would be prepared to issue at the pricing
and closing of any offering of debt or equity securities issued as part of the
Financing upon the completion of customary procedures, and cause such
accountants to issue such comfort letters at the pricing and closing of any
such offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is
understood and agreed that the condition precedent set forth in _Section
7.2(b)_, as applied to the Companys obligations under this _Section 6.13_,
shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the Financing has not been obtained as
a direct result of the Companys material breach of its obligations under this
_Section 6.13_ resulting from its Willful Breach, gross negligence or bad
faith, as may be determined in a final, non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall:
(A) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or reimburse any
costs and expenses in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing; (B)
have any liability or obligation under any agreement or any document related
to the Financing until the Closing occurs; (C) be required to incur any
liability that is not expressly provided for in this _Section 6.13(b)_ in
connection with the Financing and not otherwise indemnified hereunder or
otherwise indemnified on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company; (D)
otherwise be required to take any action in violation or conflict with any of
the Companys or its Subsidiaries respective organizational documents or
applicable Law or any Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a
party; (E) be required to deliver opinions of external or internal counsel;
(F) be required to provide access to or disclose information that would
reasonably be expected to jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene
Law or violate any Contract; (G) be required to waive or amend any terms of
this Agreement or any other Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries
is a party with effect prior to the Closing Date; (H) be required to provide
any cooperation to the extent it would cause (1) any condition to Closing set
forth in _Article VII_ not to be satisfied or (2) a breach of this Agreement;
(I) be required to prepare separate financial statements for any Subsidiary of
the Company, any pro forma financial statements or financial projections or
any other financial statements or information not otherwise prepared by the
Company in the ordinary course of its business; (J) be required to change any
fiscal period; (K) be required to file or furnish, prior to the Effective
Time, any reports or information with the SEC in connection with or as a
result of the Financing (including as a result of the inclusion of any
material, non-public information of or relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries in any offering document or marketing materials relating to the
Financing) and/or (L) be required to execute, prior to the Closing Date, any
definitive financing documents, including any credit or other agreements,
pledge or security documents, or other certificates or documents in connection
with the Financing, if any such document or agreement becomes operative prior
to the Closing, and no obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any
document, agreement or any other contract relating to the Financing shall be
operative prior to the Closing; and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing, all
corporate, limited liability or other organizational actions taken pursuant to
this Section 6.13 shall become effective only if and when the Closing occurs
and shall be derived exclusively from the authority of, and shall only be
taken by, the board of directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries or other
governing body of the Company and its Subsidiaries as constituted after giving
effect to the Closing.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and their respective Representatives, from and against any and all liabilities
or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith, except in the event such
liabilities or losses arose out of or result from the Willful Breach, gross
negligence or bad faith of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company and its Subsidiaries (including those of its Affiliates and
Representatives) in connection with taking action required or requested by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.13_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the provisions contained in this _Section 6.13_ represent the sole
obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their
respective Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and no other provision of this Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or
modify such obligations. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of
its and its Subsidiaries logos, trademarks and trade names in connection with
the arranging and consummation of the Financing; _provided_ that such logos,
trademarks and trade names are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the logos, trademarks and trade names.

 



 

6.14 _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) _Credit Facility_. The Company shall use, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to cause the agent under the
Credit Facility to deliver to Parent, on or prior to the second Business Day
prior to Closing, a copy of a payoff letter (subject to the delivery of funds
as arranged by Parent) with respect to the Credit Facility, in customary form,
which payoff letter shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to
fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties,
breakage costs and any other monetary obligations then due and payable under
the Credit Facility as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual
thereafter) (the " _Payoff Amount_ ") and (ii) state that upon receipt of the
Payoff Amount under such payoff letter, the Credit Facility and all related
loan documents shall be terminated. At Closing, the Surviving Corporation
shall (with funds arranged by Parent) repay the outstanding amount of
indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Credit Facility by
wire transfer of immediately available funds as provided for in the payoff
letter.

 



 

(b) _Convertible Notes; Capped Call Transactions_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, and within the time periods required by the
terms of each Convertible Notes Indenture and the Capped Call Documentation,
the Company shall take all actions required by the applicable Convertible
Notes Indentures and the Capped Call Documentation, respectively, to be
performed prior to the Effective Time including the giving of any notices that
may be required, _provided_ that the Company will provide copies of any such
notice to Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior to delivering any such
notice (except that the foregoing shall be deemed to be satisfied with respect
to any such notice that is required under the applicable Convertible Notes
Indenture to be delivered within one (1) Business Day of the public
announcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby so
long as the Company provides copies of such notice to Parent on or prior to
the date of this Agreement), and all such notices and actions (including the
specific substance and/or content thereof) that are not required by the terms
of the applicable Convertible Notes Indenture or the Capped Call
Documentation, as applicable, shall be subject to the prior approval of Parent
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(ii) The Company agrees (A) to use its reasonable best efforts to reasonably
cooperate with Parent, at Parents written request, to enter into arrangements
with the counterparties of each Capped Call Transaction to cause such Capped
Call Transaction to be exercised, settled, terminated

 



     

 

 



 

and/or cancelled as of the Effective Time, it being understood that the
calculation and settlement of any amounts payable thereunder shall be payable
only in cash, and subject to the mutual agreement of Parent, the Company and
the respective terms of the Capped Call Documentation, as such terms may be
amended or modified from time to time, or pursuant to such other written
agreement relating to the termination of the Capped Calls Transactions as
agreed between the Company and the applicable counterparty and (B) not amend,
modify or terminate the Capped Call Documentation without the prior written
consent of Parent (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that such
limitations shall not apply to any modification or adjustment made
unilaterally by the counterparty to a Capped Call Transaction pursuant to the
terms of the applicable Capped Call Documentation).

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that nothing in this _Section 6.14(b)_ shall require the Company to
(A) pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any
payment prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time for which it has not
received prior full reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified and held
harmless to its reasonable satisfaction by or on behalf of Parent; (B) enter
into any instrument or agreement, or agree to any change or modification to
any instrument or agreement, that is effective prior to the occurrence of the
Effective Time or that would be effective if the Effective Time did not occur;
(C) be required to deliver opinions of external or internal counsel; (D) be
required to provide access to or disclose information that would reasonably be
expected to jeopardize attorney-client privilege or other privilege or
contravene Law or violate any Contract; or (E) compromise any prior Tax or
accounting position. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
obligations in this _Section 6.14(b)_, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that its obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not conditioned upon either (1) the
execution of supplemental indentures pursuant to each Convertible Note
Indenture by the relevant trustee thereunder or (2) the exercise, settlement,
termination and/or cancellation of the Capped Call Transactions.

 



 

(c) _Reimbursement; Indemnity_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub (i) shall
promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company and its
Subsidiaries, for all fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in connection
with the actions of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives contemplated by this _Section 6.14_ and (ii)
acknowledges and agrees that the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates and Representatives shall not be required to incur any liability to
any Person prior to the Closing with respect to any actions of the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives contemplated by this
_Section 6.14_. Parent and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the actions
contemplated by this _Section 6.14_ in each case, except to the extent any
such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments or penalties arise from the Companys Willful Breach, as may be
determined in a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 



 

6.15 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price" "moratorium," "business
combination," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover
statute or regulation is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent
and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

 



 

6.16 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought against the

 



     

 

 



 

Company or any members of its Board of Directors after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (any such litigation, the "
_Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent in writing of any such
Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect
to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate (but not control), at Parents sole cost and expense, in the
defense of any Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall not settle or
agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

6.17 _Approval of Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub_. Immediately following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent (directly or through its
Subsidiaries) shall cause the sole stockholder of Merger Sub to execute and
deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent approving the Merger
in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

6.18 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
(a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and, if applicable, the Debt Agreement and
(b) ensure that, prior to the Closing, Merger Sub shall not conduct any
business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by
this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness.

 



 

6.19 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual (including any Person who is deemed to be a
"director by deputization" under applicable securities Laws) who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 



 

6.20 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
(or shall cause its Subsidiaries to), at Parents request, complete each of
the items described in Section 6.20 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "
_Pre-Closing Restructuring_ "); _provided_ that, if this Agreement is validly
terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1_ (other
than as a result of the breach by the Company of this _Section 6.20_), Parent
shall reimburse the Company for any reasonable costs, expenses, Taxes and
other liabilities incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection
with or otherwise arising out of the Pre-Closing Restructuring (collectively,
the " _Restructuring Costs_ ").

Sub may rely, as a basis for not consummating the Merger, on the failure of

 **ARTICLE VIII** ** 
TERMINATION**

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; or

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before 5:00 p.m. San Jose, California time on December 3, 2019
(as may be extended pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_, the " _Outside Date_
") and if the conditions pursuant to _Article VII_ of the terminating partys
obligations to effect the Merger have not been satisfied or waived by the
party entitled to the benefit thereof by such date (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing);
_provided_ that if on the then-applicable Outside Date (A) the conditions to
effect the Merger set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ (the "
_Regulatory Conditions_ ") or, to the extent relating to the Regulatory
Conditions, _Section _ _7.1(b)_ , shall not have been satisfied and (B) all
other conditions to Closing of the Party seeking termination have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, which conditions shall be capable of being satisfied
at such time) or waived (which waiver may be solely for purposes of this
_Section 8.1(b)_), then the Outside Date will automatically be extended up to
two (2) times for a period of five (5) months each, first to May 3, 2020 and
then to October 3, 2020; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to
the Party seeking to terminate if any action of such Party (or, in the case of
Parent, any action of Merger Sub) or the failure of such Party (or, in the
case of Parent, the failure of Merger Sub) to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Effective
Time has been the primary cause of the failure of the Effective Time to occur
on or before the then-applicable Outside Date; or

 



 

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority located or having jurisdiction within the United
States shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other final
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such
order, decree, ruling or other action is or shall have become final and
nonappealable

 



      

 

 



 

(any of the foregoing, a " _Restraint_ "); _provided_ that the Party seeking
to terminate pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall have used such standard
of efforts as may be required of such Party pursuant to its obligations under
_Section 6.4_ to prevent, oppose and remove any such Restraint; or

 



 

(d) by the Company if:

 



 

(i) there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement,
or any such representation or warranty shall be untrue, such that the
conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.3_ would not be satisfied and, in
either case, such breach or condition is not curable in a manner sufficient to
allow the satisfaction of such conditions or, if curable, is not cured in a
manner sufficient to allow the satisfaction of such conditions prior to the
earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by the
Company to Parent and (B) five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if the Company is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, in order to enter into a
written definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal that did not
result from a material breach of _Section 6.6_, in compliance with the terms
and conditions of _Section 6.6(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be entitled to terminate the Agreement under this _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_, and no such purported termination shall have any effect, unless,
prior to or concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent (or
one of its designees) the Company Termination Payment pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)(i)_; or

 



 

(e) by Parent if:

 



 

(i) there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement, or any
such representation or warranty shall be untrue, such that the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.1_ or _7.2_ would not be satisfied and, in either case,
such breach or condition is not curable in a manner sufficient to allow the
satisfaction of such conditions or, if curable, is not cured in a manner
sufficient to allow the satisfaction of such conditions prior to the earlier
of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the
Company and (B) five (5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date; _provided_
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, a Change of Recommendation
shall have occurred (it being agreed that the taking of any action by the
Company, the Company Board or any of its Representatives permitted by _Section
6.6(b)_ (other than _Section 6.6(b)(v)_ thereof) shall not give rise to a
right to terminate pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_); or

 



 

(f) by either Parent or the Company if the Company Requisite Vote shall not
have been obtained at the Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at
any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case, at which a vote on the
approval of this Agreement was taken.

 



 

8.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. Subject to _Section 8.3_, in the event of a
valid termination by Parent or the Company, or both, pursuant to _Section
8.1_ hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made (other than in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)_), and this Agreement shall

 



     

 

 



 

terminate and be null and void, and the Merger shall be terminated, without
further action by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (other than the concurrent
or prior payment by the Company of a Company Termination Payment to the extent
provided in _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_).

 



 

8.3 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to

in each case, survive such termination; _provided_ that subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 8.3(e)_, nothing herein shall relieve any
Party hereto of any liability for damages resulting from fraud or Willful
Breach prior to such termination by any Party hereto. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that nothing in this _Section 8.3_ shall be deemed to affect their
right to specific performance under _Section 9.2_.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ ) or by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)(ii)_ ( _Change of Recommendation_ ), then the Company shall pay the
Company Termination Payment to Parent (or one of its designees), (A) at or
prior to the date of termination in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ ) or (B) as promptly as reasonably
practicable in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_ (

funds to the account or accounts designated in writing by Parent to the
Company for such purpose;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by either Parent or the Company (as
applicable) pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ ( _Outside Date_ ), _Section
8.1(e)(i)_ ( _Company Breach_ ) or _Section 8.1(f)_ ( _Company Requisite

termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Sections 8.1(b)_ (
_Outside Date_ ) or _8.1(e)(i)_ ( _Company Breach_ )) or the taking of a vote
to approve this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting or any postponement or
adjournment thereof (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_ ( _Company Requisite Vote_ )) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made directly to the Companys stockholders, or such a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known, and, in each
case, such _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have not been withdrawn in a
_bona fide_ manner (1) prior to the Outside Date in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ ( _Outside Date_ ), (2) prior to the occurrence
of the breach that forms the basis for such termination in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ ( _Company Breach_ ) or (3) prior
to such taking of a vote to approve this Agreement in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ ( _Company Requisite Vote_ ) and (B)
within 12 months after such termination, the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (which is
subsequently consummated), or shall have consummated an Acquisition Proposal,
then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Payment, such payment to be made prior to or concurrently with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent to the Company for such purpose. For the
purpose of this _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_, all references in the definition of the
term Acquisition Proposal to "at least 20%" or "at least 80%" will be deemed
to be references to "at least 45%" and "at least 55%", respectively; or

 



     

 

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is validly terminated by (A) the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ ( _Outside Date_ ) or (B) the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ ( _No Restraint_ ) as a result of a Restraint
with respect to an Antitrust Law or the DPA and, in the case of _clauses (A)_
or _(B)_ , on the date of such termination all of the conditions to Closing
set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section _ _7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.2_ shall
have been satisfied or waived, other than (1) in the case of _Section _
_7.1(b)_ to the extent the applicable law, statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, ruling, injunction or other order relates to an
Antitrust Law or the DPA and (2) those conditions that are by their nature to
be satisfied at the Closing (which in the case of _clause (2)_ are capable of
being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), then
Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Payment promptly (and,
in any event, within three (3) Business Days following such termination);
_provided_ that the Company shall not be entitled to receive the Parent
Termination Payment if the Company is at the time of such termination in
material breach of _Section 6.4_ with respect to an Antitrust Law or the DPA.
The " _Parent Termination Payment_ " shall mean an amount equal to
$425,000,000. Any Parent Termination Payment shall be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated in
writing by the Company to Parent for such purpose.

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that each of the Company
Termination Payment and the Parent Termination Payment if, as and when
required pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, shall not constitute a penalty but
will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. The Parties acknowledge and hereby
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Payment on more than one occasion nor Parent be required to pay
the Parent Termination Payment on more than one occasion.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company
fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to _Sections 8.3(b)(i)_ or
_8.3(b)(ii)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in
_Sections 8.3(b)(i)_ or _8.3(b)(ii)_ , or any portion thereof, the Company
shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ in effect on the date
of such payment. If Parent fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)(iii) _and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Parent for the amount set
forth in _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_, or any portion thereof, Parent shall pay to
the Company its costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ in effect on the date of such payment.
Any amount payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_
shall be paid by the Company or Parent, as applicable, by wire transfer of
same day funds prior to or on the date such payment is required to be made
under _Section 8.3(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ , as applicable.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where:

 



 

(i) the Company Termination Payment is payable and Parent is paid the Company
Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, the Company Termination
Payment and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.3(d)_ (whether or not available) shall,

 



     

 

 



 

subject to _Section 9.2_, be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of
Parent, Parents Subsidiaries and all of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members,
Representatives or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_
"), in each case, against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates (collectively,
" _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss or damage suffered by any Parent
Related Party as a result of the failure of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of any
oral representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or in respect of representations
or warranties made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and except that nothing
shall relieve the Company of its obligations under _Section 6.5_ and _8.4_ ;
or

 



 

(ii) the Parent Termination Payment is payable and the Company is paid the
Parent Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, the Parent
Termination Payment and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ (whether or not available) shall, subject to
_Section 9.2_, be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Company
Related Parties against the Parent Related Parties for any loss or damage
suffered by any Company Related Party as a result of the failure of the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Agreement
to be consummated or for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this
Agreement or any certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith (including the Debt Agreement) or otherwise or in respect of any oral
representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Parent
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Debt Agreement or in respect of
representations or warranties made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and except that nothing shall relieve Parent of its obligations
under _Section 6.5_ and _8.4._

 



 

8.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each Party
shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Expenses incurred in connection with (i) HSR
Act filings shall be borne by Parent and (ii) the filing, printing and mailing
of the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

9.1 _No Other Representations and Warranties; No Survival_.

 



 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
_Article IV_ (as qualified by the SEC Reports and the Company Disclosure
Schedule) or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, none of
the Company, any of its Affiliates or any other Person on behalf of the
Company makes any express or implied representation or warranty (and there is,
and has been, no reliance by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, investment bankers, advisors, Representatives or authorized agents on
any such representation or warranty) with respect to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or with respect to any other
information provided, or made available, to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the accuracy or completeness
thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability or other

 



     

 

 



 

obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives or Affiliates or any
other Person resulting from Parents, Merger Subs or their Representatives
or Affiliates use of any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other material made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives
or Affiliates, including any information made available in the electronic data
room maintained by the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, teasers, marketing materials, consulting reports or
materials, confidential information memoranda, management presentations,
functional "break-out" discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf
of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives or in any other form
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless and
to the extent any such information is expressly included in a representation
or warranty contained in _Article IV_ (as qualified by the Company Disclosure
Schedule) or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
_Article V_ (as qualified by the Parent Disclosure Schedule) or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub makes any express or implied representation or warranty (and there
is, and has been, no reliance by the Company or any of its Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
investment bankers, advisors, Representatives or authorized agents on any such
representation or warranty) with respect to Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or with respect to any
other information provided, or made available, to the Company or its
Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the accuracy or completeness thereof. Without
limiting the foregoing, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability or other obligation to the Company or its
Representatives or Affiliates or any other Person resulting from the Companys
or its Representatives or Affiliates use of any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to the Company or its
Representatives or Affiliates, including teasers, marketing materials,
consulting reports or materials, confidential information memoranda,
management presentations, functional "break-out" discussions, responses to
questions submitted on behalf of the Company or its Representatives or in any
other form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
unless and to the extent any such information is expressly included in a
representation or warranty contained in _Article V_ (as qualified by the
Parent Disclosure Schedule).

 



 

(c) None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including
any rights arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements, shall survive the Effective Time, except for those
covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to
be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

 



 

9.2 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damages for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal
remedy and without any requirement for the posting of security, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. The Parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to
the Closing, each of the Parties shall be entitled to seek

 



     

 

 



 

specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and
to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement, including _Sections 6.4_ and
_6.12_ , by the other Parties and to cause the other Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.2_, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt, while Parent may concurrently seek (i)
specific performance, subject in all respects to this _Section 9.2_ and (ii)
payment of the Company Termination Payment, as the case may be, if, as and
when required pursuant to this Agreement, under no circumstances shall Parent
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to
cause the consummation of the Merger, on the one hand, and payment of the
Company Termination Payment. The pursuit of specific enforcement or other
equitable remedies by any party hereto will not be deemed an election of
remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether
at law or in equity) to which such party may be entitled at any time. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company Related Parties shall not be entitled to any
decree or order of specific performance or mandamus or injunction against the
Debt Financing Sources Related Parties with respect to the Financing.

 



 

9.3 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law
(including the DGCL), at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may
modify or amend this Agreement by written agreement, executed and delivered by
duly authorized officers of the respective Parties; _provided_ that after
receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, no amendment shall be made which by Law
requires the further approval of such stockholders without such further
approval having first been obtained; _provided further_ that any modification
or amendment of _Section 9.2_, this proviso of _Section 9.3_, _Section
9.8(e)_, _Section 9.10_ (solely to the extent that it relates to the Debt
Financing Sources Related Parties) or _Section 9.11_ (solely to the extent
that it relates to the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties) that is
materially adverse to the interests of the Debt Financing Sources Related
Parties, will not be effective against the Debt Financing Sources Related
Parties without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

9.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any Party hereto may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other Parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby and specifically
referencing this Agreement. The failure or delay of any Party to assert any
rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

 



 

9.5 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (x) when delivered
personally by hand (with written confirmation of receipt by other than
automatic means, whether electronic or otherwise), (y) when sent by e-mail (
_provided_ that no "error message" or other notification of non-delivery is
received) or (z) one (1) Business Day following the day sent by an

9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is found
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

9.7 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits
hereto and the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement
shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior
written consent of each of the other Parties, and any assignment without such
consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that (i) Parent (or one or more of
its Affiliates) shall have the right, without the prior written consent of the
Company, to assign all or any portion of its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement, from and after Closing to any parties providing the
Financing pursuant to the terms thereof for purposes of creating a security
interest herein or otherwise assign as collateral in respect of such Financing
and (ii) Merger Sub shall have the right to assign all or any portion of its
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent without such consent upon notice to the Company, and in
the case of each of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above, no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



     

 

 



 

 _provided further_ , that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted
to assign this Agreement to any Person to the extent such that, as a result of
such assignment, either (x) any additional consent or approval of, or filing,
declaration or registration with, any Governmental Authority would be required
under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or (y) any delay would occur with respect to any consent or approval
of, or filing, declaration or registration with, any Governmental Authority
that otherwise is required to be made under this Agreement or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

9.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and its successors and assigns, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a) at and after
the Effective Time, with respect to the provisions of _Section 6.11_ which
shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who
are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof, (b) at and after the
Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Shares to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (c) after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company
Options, Restricted Stock Units and/or PSUs to receive the Option
Consideration, the RSU Consideration or the PSU Consideration payments
contemplated by _Section 3.2_, as the case may be, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, (d) prior to the Effective Time, the
right of the Company, on behalf of the holders of Common Stock and the holders
of Company Equity Awards, as applicable, to pursue damages (including monetary
damages based on the loss of the economic benefits of the Merger, including
the loss of the premium offered to such holders), for Parents or Merger Subs
breach of this Agreement ( _provided_ that this _clause (d)_ is not intended
to, and under no circumstances shall it, create any right for the holders of
Common Stock or Company Equity Awards to bring any Action against Parent or
Merger Sub, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise), and (e) the Debt
Financing Sources Related Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_clause (e)_ , _Section 9.2_ (solely to the extent that it relates to the
Debt Financing Sources Related Parties), the proviso of _Section 9.3_ (solely
to the extent that it relates to the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties),
_Section 9.10_ (solely to the extent that it relates to the Debt Financing
Sources Related Parties) and _Section 9.11_ (solely to the extent that it
relates to the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties).

 



 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to
choice or conflict of law principles thereof that would result in the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction).

 



 

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably (i) consents to submit itself to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof,
(ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
courts of the State of Delaware, as described above and (iv) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 9.5_.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in _Section 9.5_ shall be effective service of process
for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions

 



     

 

 



 

contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 9.10_, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, that the suit, action or proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further
