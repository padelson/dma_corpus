THE MERGER; CLOSING  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ , and in accordance with the Applicable Laws, at the Effective Time, CDM shall be merged with and into Merger Sub. The Merger shall have the effects specified herein and in the TBOC and the DLLCA. As a result of the Merger, the separate partnership existence of CDM shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving entity of the Merger (the "Surviving Company"), and as an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Regency. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing._ The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Andrews Kurth LLP in Houston, Texas, at 8:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, or such other place and time as CDM and Regency shall agree, on January 31, 2008, or on such earlier date (but not before January 2, 2008) as may be determined by Regency upon not less than two Business Days notice to CDM, provided that, 

   ##### 

  

    

at the time of such notice, all of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_
have then been satisfied or waived (other than with respect to the delivery
of the certificates described in _Sections 6.2(c) _and _6.3(c)_ , which are
to be delivered at Closing). The date of the Closing is herein called the
"Closing Date". Immediately following the Closing, and on the Closing Date,
the Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by duly filing a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of each of the State of Texas and the State of Delaware in such form as
is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of,
Applicable Laws of the State of Texas and the State of Delaware (the date and
time of such filing being the "Effective Time") and as mutually agreed to by
CDM and Regency. . 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the Applicable Laws of the State of Texas and the State of Delaware. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the real estate, property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and other assets of CDM and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of CDM and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Company. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Governing Instruments; Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company._  

   

 (a) The certificate of formation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company until duly amended in accordance with its terms and Applicable Laws, except that in connection with the Merger the name of the Surviving Company may be changed to a name utilizing "CDM", including CDM Resource Management. 

   

 (b) The limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until duly amended in accordance with its terms and Applicable Laws, except that in connection with the Merger the name of the Surviving Company may be changed to a name utilizing "CDM", including CDM Resource Management. 

   

 (c) The directors and officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Company from the Effective Time until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed in accordance with the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company and Applicable Laws. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Conversion of Securities._  

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each member interest of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and continue as a member interest of the Surviving Company. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, CDM or the holders of any of the Partnership Interests, the issued and outstanding Partnership Interest held by a Partner immediately prior to the Effective 

   ##### 

  

    

Time shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) the
Per Partnership Interest Cash Consideration and (ii) the Per Partnership
Interest Unit Consideration issuable to the holder of such Partnership
Interest (and cash in lieu of fractional Class D Common Units in accordance
with _Section 1.7_) (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Partnership Interests
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Partnership Interests except for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Partnership Interests and
except as otherwise provided herein or by Applicable Laws. At the Effective
Time, the transfer books of CDM shall be closed and, thereafter, there shall
be no further registration of transfers of partnership interests of CDM on
the records of CDM. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Acquisition Price._  

   

 (a) The aggregate consideration to be received by the Partners in the Merger shall consist of the sum (the "Final Purchase Price") of (x) $655,000,000 less (y) the amount by which (i) the Payoff Amount exceeds (ii) the Allowed Debt Amount and less (z) the aggregate of all costs and expenses payable by CDM that are associated with the proposed initial public offering of units of CDM Resource Partners, L.P. and that were not paid as of November 1, 2007. Such aggregate consideration shall be payable in cash and Class D Common Units upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, each of the following terms has the meaning set forth below: 

   

 (i) "Aggregate Cash Consideration" means $450,000,000 less (x) the amount by which (i) the Payoff Amount exceeds (ii) the Allowed Debt Amount and less (y) the aggregate of all costs and expenses payable by CDM that are associated with the proposed initial public offering of units of CDM Resource Partners, L.P. and that were not paid as of November 1, 2007. 

   

 (ii) "Aggregate Unit Consideration" means the number of Class D Common Units, rounded down to the nearest whole number, resulting from the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $205,000,000 by (y) the Discounted Average Price. 

   

 (iii) "Allowed Debt Amount" means the aggregate principal amount of borrowings made after October 31, 2007 under CDMs revolving credit facility, existing as of the date of this Agreement (as same may be amended or modified prior to Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), to acquire inventory, compressor package components and compressor units (including packaging fees) or otherwise for CDMs working capital and general business purposes in the ordinary course of business, in each case consistent with past practice, and which borrowings remain outstanding as of the Closing Date, to the extent the aggregate principal amount of such borrowings does not exceed the 

   ##### 

  

    

sum of (A) $15,000,000 plus (B) for the month of December, the product equal
to (x) $483,871 multiplied by (y) the number of days from and after, but not
including, November 30, 2007 until, but not including, the Closing Date, or
if the Closing Date does not occur in December then until and including
December 31, 2007, plus (C) if the Closing has not occurred on or
before December 31, 2007 then for each calendar month during 2008 commencing
before Closing occurs, an amount equal to $5,000,000 plus an amount equal to
the product of (x) $416,667 multiplied by (y) the number of days in that
respective month from and after, but not including, the seventh day of such
month until, but not including, the Closing Date (or if the Closing Date does
not occur during that month, until and including the last day of such month).
For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the amount of such borrowings
shall not be deemed reduced to the extent that any repayment thereof is made
from cash contributed to CDM by either or both Partners after the date of
this Agreement. 

   

 (iv) "Class D Common Units" means the Class D Common Units to be issued pursuant to and having the rights, powers, privileges and preferences specified in Amendment No. 3 to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Regency, as amended (the "Regency Partnership Agreement"), the form of which Amendment is attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ (the "Partnership Agreement Amendment"). The Class D Common Units shall be convertible pursuant to their terms into units representing limited partner interests of Regency designated as Common Units ("Common Units") and having the rights, powers, privileges and preferences specified in the Regency Partnership Agreement. 

   

 (v) "Discounted Average Price" means the product of (A) the average of the closing sales prices, regular way, of a Common Unit, as such price is reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or such other source as CDM and Regency shall agree in writing, over the time period beginning on and including the tenth trading day immediately prior to the date of this Agreement and ending on and including the tenth trading day immediately after the date of this Agreement, multiplied by (B) 0.925, provided, that, if such product is less than $27.00, then the Discounted Average Price shall be deemed $27.00, and, if such product is greater than $33.00, then the Discounted Average Price shall be deemed $33.00. 

   

 (vi) "Per Partnership Interest Cash Consideration" means the product of the Aggregate Cash Consideration multiplied by the sharing ratio of the particular Partner held in accordance with the CDM Partnership Agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time; as such sharing ratio is identified in _Exhibit A_ hereto. 

   

 (vii) "Per Partnership Interest Unit Consideration" means the product of the Aggregate Unit Consideration multiplied by the sharing ratio attributable to the Partnership Interest of the particular Partner held in accordance 

   ##### 

  

    

with the CDM Partnership Agreement immediately prior to the Effective Time; as
such sharing ratio is identified in _Exhibit A_ hereto. 

   

 (c) The Final Purchase Price plus any liabilities to which CDM is subject that are not otherwise included in the definition of Final Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets of CDM as of the Closing in accordance with a schedule to be prepared by the Parties as soon as practicable using the allocation method provided by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder. The Parties shall report the transactions contemplated hereby on all Tax Returns (including information returns and supplements thereto required to be filed by the Parties under Section 1060 of the Code) in a manner consistent with such agreed upon allocation (as may be adjusted consistent with such schedule and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder). 

  

 Section 1.7 _Fractional Interests_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional interests of Class D Common Units shall be issued in the Merger and, except as provided in this _Section 1.7_ , no dividend or other distribution, unit split or interest shall relate to any such fractional unit, and such fractional unit shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a unitholder of Regency. In lieu of any fractional interest of Class D Common Units to which a holder of Partnership Interests would otherwise be entitled, such holder shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the Discounted Average Price by (ii) the fraction of an interest of Class D Common Units to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, in which case the Merger Consideration payable by Regency to such holder in lieu of the fractional Class D Common Unit shall be such amount of cash. The Parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional interests of Class D Common Units was not separately bargained for consideration but represents merely a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional interests of Class D Common Units. 

  

 Section 1.8 _Withholding Taxes._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Regency, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Partnership Interests pursuant to this Agreement any amount that may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by Regency, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company, as the case may be, and are paid over to the appropriate Governmental Agency in accordance with Applicable Laws, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Partnership Interests in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Regency, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 1.9 _Escrow Arrangement_. At Closing, $118,250,000 worth of the Aggregate Unit Consideration (for this purpose, such number of Class D Common Units being equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $118,250,000 by the Discounted Average Price, as rounded up, hereafter the "Escrowed Units") shall be deposited by Regency with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to an escrow agreement to be dated the Closing Date and substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "Escrow Agreement"). Such Class D Common Units, together with any securities or other property, including cash, as may be issued 

   ##### 

  

    

in connection therewith, and any earnings and interest thereon, are referred
to herein as the "Escrow Fund". The Partners shall be entitled to vote all
Class D Common Units while held in the Escrow Fund pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement on any matter submitted for a vote by the holders of Class D
Common Units or Common Units. Any distributions of Operating Surplus (as
defined in the Regency Partnership Agreement) made by Regency on the Escrowed
Units shall be distributed directly by Regency to the Partners and shall not
be deposited into the Escrow Fund. For federal income tax purposes, the
Partners shall be treated as the owners of the Escrow Fund and shall be taxed
on the interest and earnings thereon. The Parties agree that the Class D
Common Units shall not be subject to Section 483 of the Code. The Parties
agree to treat the issuance of all Class D Common Units to the
Partners hereunder in accordance with Section 721 of the Code. Regency shall
be entitled, at any time and from time to time on or prior to the day that is
one year following the Closing Date, to submit to the Escrow Agent a claim (a
"Claim Notice") for Damages claimed pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or for any
other amounts owing to Regency under this Agreement, including under _Article
9_ (such Damages and such amounts, each a "Claim"). Any such Claim Notice
submitted by Regency to the Escrow Agent shall also be provided (and Regency
shall certify in the Claim Notice that a copy is being provided) in writing
to the Partners, and such notice shall state with particularity the nature
and amount of the Claim and the basis for which Regency is entitled to
compensation for such Claim under this Agreement. A Claim Notice may instruct
the Escrow Agent to deliver to Regency, or its designee, such number of Class
D Common Units (or Common Units if such Class D Common Units have been
converted into Common Units), and such other portion of the Escrow Fund, as
shall satisfy the amount of such Claims by Regency ( _provided, however_ that
the determination of the number of Class D Common Units or Common Units to be
delivered to Regency or its designee shall be made in accordance with the
then applicable Market Price of the Common Units into which the Class D
Common Units are convertible or the then applicable Market Price of the
Common Units if such Class D Common Units have been converted into Common
Units), upon the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The Partners may
within 15 Business Days after receiving a Claim Notice give notice to Regency
and the Escrow Agent of any objection thereto (the "Objection Notice"). If the
Partners fail to deliver timely an Objection Notice, then the Escrow Agent
shall distribute to Regency such assets and property from the Escrow Fund as
shall satisfy such Claim described in such Claim Notice, all in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement. If the Partners timely deliver an
Objection Notice, then Regency and the Partners shall promptly, and in any
event within 10 days after delivery of the Objection Notice, meet to attempt
to resolve any disputes with respect thereto. Any unresolved disputes shall
be resolved in the manner referred to in the Escrow Agreement. For purposes
of the foregoing, "Market Price" means, with respect to each
distribution from the Escrow Fund, the average of the closing sales prices,
regular way, of a Common Unit, as such price is reported on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market (or the principal securities exchange on which the Common Units
are then traded) by Bloomberg Financial Markets, over the 10 trading
days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding, as applicable,
(x) the date of resolution of any dispute regarding a Claim Notice as
contemplated above, (y) if there is no such dispute, the date that the
applicable Objection Notice period has lapsed or (z) the date that is one year
after the Closing Date, for purposes of the third to last sentence of this
_Section 1.9_. If, at any time Escrowed Units are to be distributed out of
the Escrow Fund to Regency in satisfaction of a Claim in accordance with the
foregoing, Escrowed Units consist of both Class D Common Units and Common
Units, then disbursement shall first be made out of Class D Common Units and
then Common Units. 

   ##### 

  

    

Promptly after the end of the one-year period after the Closing Date, the
Escrow Agent shall disburse to the Partners all of the then-remaining Escrow
Fund other than that portion thereof having a Market Price as of the date
specified in clause (z) of the second preceding sentence equal to 125% times
the aggregate amount of any outstanding Claims that have been set forth in
Claim Notices theretofore delivered to the Exchange Agent. Regency, on the one
hand, and the Partners, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for 50%
of the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent. Regency agrees that it shall
submit Claim Notices against the Escrow Fund as contemplated by this _Section
1.9_ prior to seeking any other remedies Regency may have after Closing for
such Damages or other amounts owing to Regency under this Agreement, so long
as the amount of the then available Escrow Fund is sufficient to cover the
Claims under such Claim Notices. 

  

 Section 1.10 _Regency Deliveries_. At the Closing, Regency shall deliver or cause to be delivered: 

   

 (a) to each Partner an amount equal to the respective Per Partnership Interest Cash Consideration as provided in _Section 1.5_, plus any cash in lieu of fractional Class D Common Units as provided in _Section 1.7_, all payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by each such Partner at least one Business Day in advance of the Closing Date;

 (g) two registration rights agreements, substantially in the form attached hereto as (and as contemplated by) _Exhibit H_, dated the Closing Date and duly executed on behalf of Regency (the "Registration Rights Agreements"); 

   

 (h) such other agreements, consents, documents and instruments as are reasonably required to be delivered by Regency pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonably required in connection herewith, including all such other
instruments as the Partners or their counsel may reasonably request in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 1.11 _Deliveries of the Partners_. At the Closing, CDM and the Partners shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Regency: 

   

 (a) a certificate from the Secretary of State of the State of Texas dated within five Business Days of the Closing Date confirming the due formation and good standing of CDM;

ARTICLE 2 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTNERS 

   

 Each Partner, severally and not jointly with any other Partner, represents and warrants as to itself to Regency and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 Section 2.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Authority of the Partners_. 

   

 (a) Such Partner is a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation, and has all requisite limited liability company power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. 

   

 (b) Such Partner has the requisite limited liability company power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and such other Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by all requisite limited liability company action on the part of such Partner. This Agreement and such other Transaction Documents have been or will be duly executed and delivered by such Partner, and (assuming each of the applicable Transaction Documents constitutes the valid and legally binding obligations of the other parties hereto and thereto) such Transaction Documents constitute or, if not yet executed, will at Closing constitute valid and legally binding obligations of such Partner, enforceable against such Partner in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Title to Interests_. Such Partner has good and valid record and beneficial title to the Partnership Interest as set forth opposite such Partners name on _Exhibit A_ hereto, which Partnership Interest entitles such Partners to the sharing ratio specified on _Exhibit A_ , and each of the Partnership Interests and specified sharing ratio is free and clear of any and all mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security interests, pledges, conditional sale contracts, charges, easements, rights of way, reservations, options, rights of first refusal and other similar encumbrances (collectively, "Liens") other than Liens relating to Indebtedness described in  _Section 5.12(d)_. The Partnership Interest set forth opposite such Partners name on  _Exhibit A_ hereto constitutes all of the partnership interests of CDM held of record or beneficially by such Partner. CDMR Holdings owns all of the membership interests of CDM OLP GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and one of the Partners. Neither such Partner nor, to the knowledge of such Partner, any other Person is a party to (i) any option, warrant, call, subscription, convertible security or other right, agreement or commitment (other than this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement) that could require CDM or any such Person to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any interest of CDM or, after the Closing, the Surviving
Company or any of its Affiliates to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any interest of the Surviving Company or (ii) any voting trust, proxy or
other agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of any partnership
interest of CDM. 

  

 Section 2.3 _No Conflicts_. Except as to Liens and agreements specifically relating to Indebtedness described in _Section 5.12(d)_, neither the execution and delivery by such Partner of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document to which it is or will be at Closing a party or any instrument required hereby or thereby to be executed and delivered by it at Closing nor the performance by such Partner of its obligations hereunder or thereunder will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement of such Partner, (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon the Partners Partnership Interest under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, concession, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which the Partner is a party, or by which it or any of its properties may be bound or subject, or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in _Section 3.6(b)_, contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any Applicable Laws or any judgment or decree binding upon or applicable to the Partner. 

  

 Section 2.4 _Investor Status_. 

   

 (a) The Class D Common Units are being acquired by such Partner for investment purposes only, for such Partners own account and not as nominee or agent for any other Person, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. Such Partner is not a party to or bound by, and does not presently intend or have any plans to enter into, any agreement, contract, commitment, arrangement, promise or undertaking with any Person to sell, transfer or pledge any part of the Class D Common Units, other than a distribution, without consideration, of such Class D Common Units to one or more of such Partners ultimate beneficial owners. 

   

 (b) Such Partner has such expertise, knowledge and sophistication in financial and business matters generally that it is capable of evaluating, and has evaluated, the merits and economic risks of its investment in Regency and the suitability of the Class D Common Units as an investment. 

   

 (c) In connection with the acquisition of the Class D Common Units hereunder, such Partner has had the opportunity to examine all aspects of Regency, its operations, and its financial condition that such Partner has deemed relevant, and has had access to all information with respect to Regency and its business in order to make an evaluation thereof. In connection with the acquisition of the Class D Common Units hereunder, such Partner has had the opportunity to ask such questions of and receive 

   ##### 

  

    

answers from officers, employees and representatives of Regency or Affiliates
of Regency concerning Regency and to obtain such additional information about
Regency as such Partner deems necessary for an evaluation thereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall any such examination, investigation
or information be deemed to modify, amend, change or otherwise qualify in any
respect the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Regency
or Merger Sub in this Agreement. In evaluating the suitability of an
investment in Regency, such Partner has not been furnished and has not relied
upon any representations other than as contained in the representations and
warranties of Regency in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the representations and warranties in _Section 4.6_ regarding the
Regency Reports). 

   

 (d) Such Partner acknowledges that copies have been made available to it, sufficiently in advance of this Agreement as such Partner deems necessary to evaluate an investment in the Class D Common Units, of each of the Regency Reports. 

   

 (e) Such Partner (i) is an "Accredited Investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act and (ii) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in Regency. 

   

 (f) Such Partner acknowledges that the Class D Common Units have not been offered or sold by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising or by means of publicly disseminated advertisements or sales literature. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Status of Class D Common Units; Disposition_. 

   

 (a) Such Partner acknowledges that no registration statement relating to the Class D Common Units has been filed under the Securities Act or any state securities law and that, consequently, the Class D Common Units (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) will constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, may not be sold, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred (and, therefore, must be held by such Partner) unless the Class D Common Units (or the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof, as applicable) subsequently are registered under the Securities Act and such state laws or until an exemption from such registration requirements is available. 

   

 (b) Neither such Partner nor anyone acting on such Partners behalf has offered or sold or will offer or sell any of the Class D Common Units (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising or has taken or will take any action that would constitute a distribution of the Class D Common Units (or the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) under the Securities Act, would render the disposition of the Class D Common Units (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act or any state or other applicable securities law, or would require registration or qualification pursuant thereto. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) Neither the Partners representations under this _Section 2.5_ nor  _Section 2.4_ above shall modify or impair Regencys obligations under the Registration Rights Agreements. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against such Partner or, to its knowledge, threatened against such Partner, at law or in equity or in any arbitration or similar proceedings, before or by any court, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality or any arbitral or other dispute resolution body, that (i) challenge or seek or the effect of which would reasonably be expected to restrain, delay or prohibit any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) prevent or would reasonably be expected to prevent such Partner from performing in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.7 _No Brokers_. Such Partner has not entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person that may result in the obligation of Regency, CDM or the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to pay any finders fees, brokerage or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

ARTICLE 3 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING CDM  

  

 Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Regency by CDM at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "CDM Disclosure Letter") and making reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken ( _provided_ that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the CDM Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent), CDM and each of the Partners, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Regency and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 Section 3.1 _Existence; Partnership Authority_. CDM is a limited partnership duly formed and validly existing under the laws of the State of Texas. CDM is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a CDM Material Adverse Effect. CDM has all requisite partnership power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. CDM has the requisite partnership power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation by CDM of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite partnership action on behalf of CDM. CDM has duly 

   ##### 

  

    

executed and delivered this Agreement. Assuming this Agreement constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of Regency and Merger Sub, this
Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
CDM, enforceable against CDM in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Partners constitutes
the only approval by the partners of CDM necessary to authorize the
consummation of the Merger as contemplated herein. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Capitalization_. The authorized partnership interests of CDM consist of limited partner interests and general partner interests. Each holder of such an interest, along with the amount and nature of such interests owned, is set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "Partnership Interests"). The Partnership Interests set forth on _Exhibit A_ are the only partner interests of CDM issued or outstanding. All such issued and outstanding partnership interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable (except as non-assessability may be affected by Sections 153.102 and 153.112 of the TBOC) and free of preemptive rights. There are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible securities or other rights, agreements or commitments that obligate CDM to issue, transfer, sell or register any partnership interests or membership interests or other equity interests or other voting securities of CDM. CDM has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the partners of CDM on any matter. There are no certificates representing any of the Partnership Interests, and no such certificates are required by the CDM Partnership Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 Section 3.4 _Subsidiaries and Affiliates_. CDM has no Subsidiaries nor does CDM otherwise own any equity interest in any Person. The only previous Subsidiary of CDM was CDM MAX, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, all of the membership interests of which were properly, lawfully and duly distributed by CDM to the Partners prior to the execution of this Agreement. CDMR Holdings, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company ("CDMR Holdings"). C/R CDM Holdings II, L.P. and C/R CDM Investment Partnership III, L.P. are Delaware limited partnerships that collectively own membership interests having a 67% sharing percentage in CDMR Holdings. CDM Compression, LLC is a Texas limited liability company, and CDM Investments, Ltd. is a Texas limited partnership, that collectively own membership interests having a 33% sharing percentage in CDMR Holdings. 

  

 Section 3.5 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a CDM Material Adverse Effect and except for (i) matters related to Taxes, which are treated exclusively in _Section 3.10_, and (ii) matters arising under Environmental Laws (as defined herein), which are treated exclusively in  _Section 3.13_: 

   

 (a) CDM is not in violation of any applicable law (including the Jones Act and other federal "maritime law"), rule, regulation, code, ordinance, governmental determination, order, treaty, convention or governmental certification requirement as in effect on the date of this Agreement (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), and no claim is pending or, to the knowledge of CDM, threatened against CDM with respect to any such matters. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) CDM holds all permits, licenses, certifications, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of each governmental or regulatory authority, commission, board or other regulatory body, administrative agency or tribunal ("Governmental Agency") necessary for the lawful conduct of its business (the "CDM Permits"). All CDM Permits are in full force and effect, there exists no defaults thereunder or breaches thereof, and CDM has no notice or actual knowledge that such CDM Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course. No Governmental Agency has given, or to the knowledge of CDM threatened to give, any written notice regarding any action to terminate, cancel or reform any CDM Permit. 

   

 (c) CDM possesses all permits, licenses, operating authorities, orders, exemptions, franchises, variances, consents, approvals or other authorizations required for the present operation of all real property leased by CDM ("CDM Real Property"). _Section 3.5_ of the CDM Disclosure Letter sets forth a listing of all the CDM Real Property. There exists no default or breach with respect to, and no party or Governmental Agency has taken or, to the knowledge of CDM, threatened to take, any action to terminate, cancel or limit any such permit, license, operating authority, order, exemption, franchise, variance, consent, approval or other authorization pertaining to the CDM Real Property. 

  

 Section 3.6 _No Conflict._  

   

 (a) Except under the agreements specifically relating to Indebtedness described in  _Section 5.12(d)_ (with respect to which _Section 3.6_ of the CDM Disclosure Letter identifies the effects thereunder that will occur upon consummation of the Closing), neither the execution and delivery by CDM of this Agreement nor the consummation by CDM of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the certificate or agreement of limited partnership of CDM, as amended and in effect on the date hereof (the "CDM Partnership Agreement"), true, complete and correct copies of which have been provided to Regency, (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of CDM under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to CDM under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, concession, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which CDM is a party, or by which CDM or any of its properties may be bound or subject, other than, with respect to all of the foregoing, any violation, conflict, breach, default, termination, right of termination or cancellation, right of purchase, acceleration or Lien arising under any prohibition on assignment included under any document referred to above in this clause (ii) resulting solely from the fact that the surviving entity in the Merger is the Surviving Company instead of CDM (and, for purposes of clarity, this clause shall in no way limit the other provisions of this clause (a) relating to a change of control of CDM), or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters 

   ##### 

  

    

referred to in _Section 3.6(b)_, contravene or conflict with or constitute a
violation of any provision of any Applicable Laws or judgment or decree
binding upon or applicable to CDM, except as, in the case of
matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), individually or in the aggregate,
that have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a CDM Material
Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery by CDM of this Agreement nor the consummation by CDM of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval, qualification or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any court or Governmental Agency, other than (i) filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), the Securities Act or applicable state securities and "Blue Sky" laws (collectively, the "Regulatory Filings") and (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of each of the States of Texas and Delaware, except for any consent, approval, qualification or authorization the failure to obtain which, and for any filing or registration the failure to make which, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a CDM Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (c) This Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby do not, and will not, upon consummation of such transactions in accordance with their terms, result in any "change of control" or similar event or circumstance under (i) the terms of any CDM Material Contract or (ii) any contract or plan under which any employees, officers or directors of CDM are entitled to payments or benefits, which, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), gives rise to rights or benefits not otherwise available absent such change of control or similar event and requires either a cash payment or an accounting charge in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect on the date of this Agreement, as recognized by the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board ("GAAP"), or (iii) any material CDM Permit. 

  

 Section 3.7 _Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities; Controls and Procedures._  

   

 (a) _Section 3.7_ of the CDM Disclosure Letter contains a copy of the (i) audited balance sheets and statements of operations, partners equity and cash flows of CDM (on a stand-alone basis, without inclusion of CDM MAX, LLC as a subsidiary of CDM) as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and (ii) the unaudited balance sheets of CDM as of each of March 31, 2007, June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2007 (the balance sheet at September 30, 2007 being referred to as the "Most Recent Balance Sheet"), and the related statements of operations, partners equity and cash flows for the periods then ending (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the "Financial Statements").

 (b) CDM does not have any liability or obligation of any nature (whether or not absolute, accrued, fixed, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected in, reserved against or otherwise described on a balance sheet of CDM or in the notes thereto in accordance with GAAP, except: (w) those set forth or reflected in the Financial Statements, (x) those incurred since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, (y) liabilities and obligations relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (z) as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a CDM Material Adverse Effect.

To CDMs knowledge, the conduct of CDMs business as currently conducted does not materially conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of others. To CDMs knowledge, there is no material infringement of any proprietary right owned by or licensed by or to CDM. 

  

 Section 3.15 _Decrees, Etc_.

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) No event relating specifically to CDM has occurred that could reasonably be expected, after the date of this Agreement, to result in a material upward adjustment in premiums under any insurance policies maintained by CDM. Excluding insurance policies that have expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of business, no excess liability or protection and indemnity insurance policy has been canceled by the insurer within one year prior to the date of this Agreement, and no threat in writing has been received by CDM to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any such insurance policy of CDM during the period of one year prior to the date of this Agreement. Prior to the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred, including the failure by CDM to give any notice or information or by giving any inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, that materially limits or impairs the rights of CDM under any such excess liability or protection and indemnity insurance policies. Since January 1, 2006, CDM has given notice or has otherwise presented every material claim known to CDM to be covered by insurance under its insurance policies in a timely fashion, or if not timely then in a manner such as had not had and will not have material prejudice, and _Section 3.16_ of the CDM Disclosure Schedule sets forth a listing of all such notices and presentations (other than health insurance claims). No such claim under any such insurance policy has been denied or disputed by the underwriters or issuers thereof. 

  

 Section 3.17 _No Brokers_. CDM has not entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person that may result in the obligation of CDM, Regency or the Surviving Company to pay any finders fees, brokerage or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 3.18 _Certain Contracts._  

   

 (a) Except as entered into after the date hereof in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 5.1_, there are no outstanding commitments, contracts, agreements or understandings to which CDM is a party or by which CDM is bound that: (i) involve commitments by CDM for terms of 12 months or longer that involve annualized payments by CDM of more than $500,000, (ii) involve payment or receipt by CDM of more than $1,000,000 in the aggregate (and in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), are not terminable by their terms, without penalty, on 30 days or less notice), (iii) contain a covenant not to compete restricting CDM or any of its Affiliates from competing or engaging in any line of business; (iv) under which CDM has (A) created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed (or may create, incur, assume or guarantee) any indebtedness for borrowed money, any obligations evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments, any obligations to pay the deferred purchase price of property or services, except trade accounts payable and other current liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business, any obligations under capitalized leases, any obligations, contingent or otherwise, or under acceptance credit, letters of credit or similar facilities(collectively, "Indebtedness"), (B) granted a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on its assets, whether tangible or intangible, to secure such Indebtedness, or agreed to any restriction or limitation on distributions, dividends or return on equity, or extended credit to any Person in an amount, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of $100,000 of committed credit (excluding trade receivables in the ordinary course of business) or (C) any indemnity, any 

   ##### 

  

   

guaranty of performance or any agreement to provide credit support or
otherwise make capital contributions, loans or advances with respect to the
obligations of any third party; (v) relate to the purchase or sale of any
business, corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
organization; (vi) involve hedges, swaps, fixed priced commitments or
other derivatives; (vii) are with an Affiliate of CDM or with a director,
officer, member, partner of CDM or any of its Affiliates; (viii) are between
CDM and CDM MAX, LLC; (ix) are otherwise material to CDM and were not entered
into in the ordinary course of business or the loss of which would reasonably
be expected to have a CDM Material Adverse Effect; (x) relate to any CDM Real
Property; (xi) constitute Compression Operating Leases; or (xii) any
amendment, supplement, restatement or other modification relating to any of
the foregoing (collectively, the "CDM Material Contracts"). 

   

 (b) As of the date of this Agreement, each CDM Material Contract is in full force and effect, and CDM has in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each CDM Material Contract to which it is party. CDM (x) does not know of, nor has it received written notice of, any material breach of or violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of CDM, does there exist any condition that with the passage of contractual grace or cure periods or the giving of notice or both would result in such a violation or default by CDM or any other party under) any CDM Material Contract and (y) has not received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any such CDM Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or to exercise remedies thereunder. Each CDM Material Contract is enforceable against CDM and, to CDMs knowledge, against each other party thereto, in each case in accordance with the terms of such CDM Material Contract, subject in all instances to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity, except where such unenforceability does not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a CDM Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 3.19 _Capital Expenditure Program_. As of the date of this Agreement, _Section 3.19_ of the CDM Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth in all material respects the capital expenditures (including expenditures for inventory, equipment and components) that are forecast to be incurred by CDM in the fourth quarter of 2007 and during all of 2008 on a quarterly basis. Regency acknowledges that forecasts are by their nature speculative and are subject to a number of factors beyond CDMs control, and that therefore the capital expenditures described therein may not be achieved. 

  

 Section 3.20 _Improper Payments_. No bribes, kickbacks or other similar payments have been made in violation of Applicable Laws by CDM or, to CDMs knowledge, any agent of CDM in connection with the conduct of CDMs business or the operation of CDMs assets, and neither CDM nor, to CDMs knowledge, any agent of CDM has received any such payments from vendors, suppliers or other Persons in violation of Applicable Laws. 

  

 Section 3.21 _Title, Ownership and Related Matters._  

   

 (a) CDM has a valid leasehold interest in all CDM Real Property, free and clear of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens and Liens and agreements specifically 

   ##### 

  

   

relating to Indebtedness described in _Section 5.12(d)_. CDM does not own
any real property other than its leasehold interests in the CDM Real
Property. 

   

 (b) CDM has, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens and Liens and agreements specifically relating to Indebtedness described in _Section 5.12(d)_, valid title to its inventory, equipment and other tangible and intangible property, including the natural gas compression equipment owned and/or operated by CDM and related spare parts as may be reduced by the consumption thereof, or increased through the replacement thereof or addition thereto, in the ordinary course of maintenance and operation of its business, in each case as necessary to permit CDM to conduct its business as currently conducted. To CDMs knowledge, all major items of equipment and other personal property are, in the aggregate, in a state of repair so as to be adequate in all material respects for reasonably prudent operations in the areas in which they are used or operated, or are to be used or operated, recognizing that at any given time one or more compressors may be out of service for routine maintenance (which includes periodic overhauling) in the ordinary course of business. As used in this Agreement, the term "Permitted Liens" shall mean Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings in which collection or enforcement is stayed; statutory Liens of lessors; Liens of carriers, warehousemen, repairmen, mechanics and materialmen arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of business, but only to the extent the underlying obligations are not more than 60 days past due or are being contested in good faith; and Liens incurred or deposits made in the ordinary course of business in connection with workers compensation, unemployment insurance and other types of social security; Liens that are immaterial in character, amount and extent and that do not detract from the value or interfere with the present use of the properties they affect; or Liens created by or on behalf of Regency or Merger Sub. 

  

 Section 3.22 _Amount of Indebtedness and Certain Expenses_. _Section 3.22_ of the CDM Disclosure Letter sets forth (i) as of October 31, 2007 and as of the date of this Agreement, an itemized list (including lender and amount outstanding) of all Indebtedness of CDM and of the amounts required to be paid to the applicable lessors under the Compression Operating Leases in order to exercise any purchase option and acquire all equipment covered thereby and (ii) as of the date of this Agreement, the estimated amount of fees and expenses that have been incurred by CDM, or by which CDM will otherwise become liable for, in connection with the proposed initial public offering of units of CDM Resource Partners, L.P. Such listing also sets forth the estimated amount of such fees and expenses that remains unpaid.

 Section 4.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Regency is a limited partnership duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Merger Sub is a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Regency is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Regency Material Adverse Effect. Each of Regency and Merger Sub has all requisite partnership or company power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of the certificate of limited partnership or formation, and the partnership agreement or limited liability agreement, of Regency and Merger Sub previously made available to CDM are true, complete and correct and contain all amendments as of the date of this Agreement.

Regency has the requisite partnership power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such other Transaction Documents. Merger Sub has the requisite company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such other Transaction Documents. The execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, respectively, and the consummation by Regency and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite partnership action on behalf of Regency and all requisite company action on behalf of Merger Sub. Each of Regency and Merger Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement. The other Transaction Documents to which Regency or Merger Sub is to be a party have been or will be duly executed and delivered by Regency and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and (assuming each of the Transaction Documents constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the parties hereto and thereto, other than Regency and Merger Sub), such Transaction Documents constitute or, if not yet executed, will at Closing constitute, valid and legally binding obligations of Regency and Merger Sub, as the case may be, enforceable against Regency and Merger Sub, as the case may be, in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity. 

  

 Section 4.3 _Regency Gas Services, LP and Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding membership interests of Merger Sub are owned by Regency Gas Services LP, a wholly owned Subsidiary of Regency. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and, as of the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any activities other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For federal income tax purposes, both Regency Gas Services LP and Merger Sub have always been treated and properly classified for federal tax purposes as disregarded entities and will be so treated and classified as of the Closing Date.

 Section 4.4 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Regency Material Adverse Effect: 

   

 (a) Neither Regency nor any Subsidiary of Regency is in violation of any Applicable Laws, and no claim is pending or, to the knowledge of Regency, threatened with respect to any such matters.

No Governmental Agency has given, or to the knowledge of Regency threatened to give, any written notice regarding any action to terminate, cancel or reform any Regency Permit. 

   

 (c) Regency and each Subsidiary of Regency possess all permits, licenses, operating authorities, orders, exemptions, franchises, variances, consents, approvals or other authorizations required for the present ownership and operation of all of its owned or leased real property ("Regency Real Property").

 Section 4.5 _No Conflict._  

   

 (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Regency and Merger Sub of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document to which it is or will be at Closing a party or any instrument required hereby or thereby to be executed and delivered by either of them at Closing nor the performance by either of them of their obligations hereunder or thereunder will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the certificate of limited partnership or formation, or the partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement of Regency or Merger Sub, as the case may be; (ii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of Regency or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to Regency or

any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of,

properties may be bound or subject; or (iii) subject to the filings and other
matters referred to in _Section 4.5(b)_, contravene or conflict with or
constitute a violation of any provision of any Applicable Laws or judgment or
decree, except as, in the case of matters described in clause (ii) or (iii),
individually or in the aggregate, that have not had and are not reasonably
likely to have a Regency Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Regency or Merger Sub of this Agreement nor the consummation by either of them of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval, qualification or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any court or Governmental Agency, other than (i) the Regulatory Filings, (ii) the filing of a listing application with the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC pursuant to _Section 5.5_, and (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of each of the States of Delaware and Texas, except for any consent, approval, qualification or authorization the failure to obtain which, and for any filing or registration the failure to make which, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Regency Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 4.6 _SEC Documents_.

As of its respective date, each Regency Report (i) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for any statements in any Regency Report that have been modified by one or more subsequent Regency Reports that were filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof. 

   

 (b) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Regency Reports (including related notes and schedules) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Regency and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Regency Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders equity, as the case may be, of Regency and its Subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may be 

   ##### 

  

   

permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y) normal, recurring year-end audit
adjustments that are not material in the aggregate), in each case in
accordance with the books and records of Regency and GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.
Neither Regency nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation
of any nature (whether or not absolute, accrued, fixed, contingent or

Upon issuance at Closing, the Class D Common Units issued to the Partners will be free of any Liens other than those created by the Partners, arising under applicable securities laws, arising under the Partnership Agreement, or arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and will not be issued in violation of any preemptive rights.

 Section 4.9 _Investment Intent_. Regency will, pursuant to the Merger, acquire the Partnership Interests for Regencys own account with the present intention of owning the Surviving Company after the Closing for investment purposes and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any public distribution in violation of any federal or state securities laws. In connection with the Merger, Regency and Merger Sub have had the opportunity to examine all 

   ##### 

  

    

aspects of CDM, its operations, and its financial condition that Regency and
Merger Sub deemed relevant, and have had access to all information with
respect to CDM and its business in order to make an evaluation thereof. In
connection with the Merger, Regency and Merger Sub have had the opportunity to
ask such questions of and receive answers from officers, employees and
representatives of CDM concerning CDM and to obtain such additional
information about CDM as Regency and Merger Sub have deemed necessary for an
evaluation thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any
such examination, investigation or information be deemed to modify, amend,
change or otherwise qualify in any respect the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of CDM or either of the Partners in this Agreement.
In evaluating the acquisition of the Partnership Interests, Regency has not
been furnished and has not relied upon any representations or warranties other
than as contained in the representations and warranties of CDM and the
Partners in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.10 _Litigation_. Except as described in the Regency Reports, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against Regency or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Regencys knowledge, threatened against Regency or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity or in any arbitration or similar proceedings, before or by any court, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality or any arbitral or other dispute resolution body, that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or are reasonably likely to have a Regency Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 4.11 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since September 30, 2007 to the date of this Agreement, there has not been (i) a Regency Material Adverse Effect or (ii) except as described in the Regency Reports filed with the SEC or as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, (A) any material change by Regency or any of its Subsidiaries in any of its accounting methods, principles or practices or any of its tax methods, practices or elections applicable to Regencys consolidated financial statements; (B) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution in respect of any partnership interest of Regency or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition of any of its partnership interests; (C) any split, combination or reclassification of any partnership interest of Regency or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for its partnership interests; (D) any damage to or any destruction or loss of physical properties owned or used by Regency or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance, that individually or in the aggregate constitutes a Regency Material Adverse Effect; or (E) any reevaluations by Regency or any of its Subsidiaries of any of their assets that, in accordance with GAAP, Regency will reflect in its consolidated financial statements, including any impairment of assets, and which in the aggregate are material to them. Since September 30, 2007 through the date of this Agreement, the business of Regency has been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, except as may have otherwise been disclosed in the Regency Reports. 

  

 Section 4.12 _Taxes_. In each tax year since its formation up to and including the current tax year, at least 90% of Regencys gross income has been income that is "qualifying income" within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code. From and at all times since its formation, Regency has qualified and has been properly treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(c) of the Code, and all Tax Returns have been prepared consistently therewith. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 4.13 _Financial Ability_. At the Closing, Regency will have cash on hand or available financing to provide, in the aggregate, funds sufficient to consummate the Merger, to pay the Aggregate Cash Consideration and to pay the Payoff Amount. There is no default existing, or which with notice or the passage of time may exist, under Regencys existing credit or other financing agreements with respect to its existing lines of credit and other borrowed money financings that could reasonably be expected to prevent Regency from having such financing available by the time of Closing. 

  

 Section 4.14 _No Brokers_. Neither Regency nor Merger Sub has entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person that may result in the obligation of the Partners to pay any finders fees, brokerage or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Regency has retained UBS Securities LLC as Regencys financial advisor, whose fees and expenses shall be paid by Regency.

 (iv) to the extent practicable, not participate or agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Agency in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Agency, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion; 

   

 (v) furnish the other Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications between it and its Affiliates and representatives on the one hand, and any Government Agency or members of any such Governmental Agencys staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (A) a Partys HSR filings need not be disclosed to the other Parties and (B) disclosure need not be made to the extent that such disclosure would reasonably be expected to jeopardize applicable attorney/client privilege or would violate contractual obligations; 

   #####

the Parties to disclose to the other Parties confidential information
about third parties in connection with seeking approvals from Governmental
Agencies to the extent that such disclosures would constitute violations of
contractual obligations or legal duties, provided that this sentence shall
not permit any Party to fail to disclose any information required to be filed

 Section 5.3 _Inspection_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement, CDM shall allow all officers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives designated by Regency reasonable access, at all reasonable times during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to (i) the personnel, records and files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs of CDM, including inspection of such properties and (ii) the (A) personnel, records and files, correspondence, audits and properties of CDM MAX, LLC that reasonably relate to the business and affairs of CDM MAX, LLC when it was a Subsidiary of CDM that are also reasonably necessary in order for Regency to assess the risks and consequences of CDM or the Surviving Company becoming subject to the actual or potential liabilities or obligations of CDM MAX, LLC (it being understood that Regency shall not be afforded access for such purpose to the proprietary Daily Resource Management Service Model or engineering data of CDM MAX, LLC), or (B) financial information that is reasonably necessary in order for Regency properly to prepare filings with the SEC regarding financial statements of CDM in accordance with Section 3-05 of Regulation S-X; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall affect any representation or warranty given by any Party hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CDM shall not be required to provide any information that (x) it reasonably believes it may not provide to Regency by reason of Applicable Laws, (y) the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to jeopardize applicable attorney/client privilege or work product protections, or (z) it is required to keep confidential by reason of contract or agreement with third parties. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. All data, reports, interpretations, forecasts, ideas, records and other information obtained pursuant to this  _Section 5.3_ relating to CDM shall be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement dated October 1, 2007 between Regency and Riverstone Holdings, LLC (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). All information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ regarding CDM MAX, LLC shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated the date of this Agreement between Regency and CDM MAX, LLC. All requests for site visits and related discussions or questions regarding procedures shall be coordinated with an executive officer of CDM, unless any such individual directs otherwise, and in no event shall Regency or anyone on Regencys behalf communicate with any supplier, customer, creditor, bank or employee (other than those employees listed in _Section 5.3_ of the CDM Disclosure Letter) of CDM concerning or related to the Merger, unless CDM consents in advance to such communication and is consulted as to the manner in which such communication is made. Any site inspection (including any environmental inspection or review) of any compressor in the field shall require the consent of the operator of the field and the owner of any surface estate that must be crossed to access such 

   ##### 

  

    

compressor, and any site inspection of any CDM Real Property shall require
the consent of the applicable lessor. Regency shall promptly discharge any
Liens that arise against the CDM Real Property as a result of such due
diligence. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "inspection" herein shall not
encompass, and neither Regency nor its representatives shall be entitled
to conduct (except as may be consented to in writing by CDM), any invasive,
surface or subsurface testing or sampling, whether contemplated by any on-
site investigation conducted in accordance with the current ASTM standards
for the conduct of a Phase II on-site investigation or otherwise, including
any soil borings, hand borings, geoprobes, test pits, or monitoring wells. In
connection with any environmental due diligence by Regency, Regency agrees to
return CDM Real Property to substantially the same condition as existed prior
to such environmental due diligence. REGENCY SHALL PROTECT, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY
AND HOLD CDM AND THE PARTNER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST
ANY AND ALL DAMAGES (AS DEFINED IN _SECTION 8.2(a)(i)_ ) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE DUE DILIGENCE CONDUCTED BY REGENCY, REGENCYS AFFILIATES OR
ANY PERSON ACTING ON REGENCYS OR ITS AFFILIATES BEHALF (COLLECTIVELY,
"REGENCY REPRESENTATIVES"), IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DUE DILIGENCE CONDUCTED
PURSUANT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY SITE VISITS, SITE INSPECTIONS
AND ANY SAMPLING OF ANY ENVIRONMENTAL MEDIA; REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH
DAMAGES ARE CAUSED BY (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF CDM OR ANY
PARTNER INDEMNIFIED PARTY EXCEPTING ONLY THOSE DAMAGES ACTUALLY CAUSED BY THE
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF CDM OR ANY PARTNER INDEMNIFIED
PARTY. Without limiting the foregoing, for purposes of this _Section 5.3_,
"Damages" includes demands, claims, lawsuits, causes of action, losses,
investigations and other proceedings, and other elements of "Damages" related
thereto, brought by or asserted by CDMs customers and the owners of any
affected surfaces estates. Regency shall, and shall cause the Regency
Representatives to, comply fully with all rules, regulations, policies and
instructions reasonably issued by CDM and provided to Regency regarding such
Persons actions while upon, entering or leaving any property. Regency shall
not, and shall cause the Regency Representatives not to, unreasonably
interfere with the day-to-day operations of the business of CDM in conducting
any due diligence activities. 

  

 Section 5.4 _Publicity_. The Parties acknowledge that they intend for there to be a public announcement regarding this Agreement that is to be mutually agreed upon and that is to be issued before the opening of trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the next trading day after execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each of Regency and CDM shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or similar public announcement pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except as may be required by Applicable Laws or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the Party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other Party before issuing any such press releases or making any such public announcements. Each of the Partners agrees that it shall not issue or allow to be issued (except 

   ##### 

  

 

by CDM in accordance with this _Section 5.4_) any press release or similar
public announcement pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of Regency. 

   

 Section 5.5 _Listing Application_. Regency shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and submit promptly to The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC a listing application covering the Common Units issuable upon conversion of the Class D Common Units issuable in connection with the Merger and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Common Units, subject to official notice of issuance.

Regency or one or more of its Affiliates shall pay all the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and all documents and instruments executed pursuant hereto and any other costs and expenses whatsoever and howsoever incurred by Regency and any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Regency shall be solely responsible for the statutory filing fees under the HSR Act. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Notification_. Each Party shall give to the others prompt notice of (i) any representation or warranty made by it or contained in this Agreement that, to such Partys knowledge, has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement and (iii) any notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the Merger; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. If, at Closing, CDM and the Partners cannot in good faith deliver the certificates contemplated by _Section 6.3(c)_ without one or more exceptions identified therein and as a result Regency is not required to consummate the Closing, and Regency elects to consummate the Closing notwithstanding such exception or exceptions, then the obligations of the Partners to indemnify Regency pursuant to _Sections 8.2(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ shall be determined as if such exception or exceptions constituted part of the CDM Disclosure Letter if CDM and the Partners notify Regency in writing of such exception(s) before Closing, provided that Regency shall have the unilateral right to extend Closing by not more than five Business Days after the date on which Regency receives such notification of such exception(s), and, if such extension would cause Closing to occur after the Termination Date, to extend the Termination Date to not later than such fifth Business Day. If, at Closing, Regency cannot in good faith deliver the certificate contemplated by _Section 6.2(c)_ without one or more exceptions identified therein and as a result CDM and the Partners are not required to consummate the Closing, and the Partners elect to consummate the Closing notwithstanding such exception or exceptions, then the obligations of Regency to indemnify the Partners pursuant to _Sections 8.3(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ shall be determined as if such exception or exceptions constituted part of the Regency Disclosure Letter if Regency notifies the Partners in writing of such exception(s) before 

   ##### 

  

 

Closing, provided that the Partners shall have the unilateral right to extend
Closing by not more than five Business Days after the date on which they
receive such notification of such exception(s), and, if such extension would
cause Closing to occur after the Termination Date, to extend the Termination
Date to not later than such fifth Business Day. From and after the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, Regency shall promptly notify CDM if
Regency acquires knowledge of any material adverse change in its financial
condition, results of operations or business. 

   

 Section 5.8 _Employee Matters._  

   

 (a) To the extent Regency or one of Regencys Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company ) continues to employ any employees of CDM immediately after the Closing, the period of employment with CDM of each employee of CDM shall be deemed to be employment and service with Regency and Regencys Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company), as applicable, for benefit plan eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit computations) under all of Regencys employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements to the extent service with Regency is recognized under any such plan, program, policy or arrangement. 

   

 (b) In connection with the continued employment of such employees of CDM, Regency shall use its reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, evidence of insurability, exclusions, waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each employee under any employee health plans established by Regency in which such employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date and (ii) provide each employee with credit for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable co-payment, deductible and out-of-pocket expense requirements under such employee health plans in which such employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) Regency may conduct discussions and negotiations with the employees of CDM with regard to the terms of their employment by Regency or one of Regencys Affiliates.

No employee of Regency, CDM or any of their respective Subsidiaries is intended to be a beneficiary of the provisions of this _Section 5.8_.

 Section 5.9 _Class D Common Units_. 

   

 (a) Each Partner agrees that the Class D Common Units issuable to it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) shall not be offered for sale, sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, transferred, exchanged or otherwise disposed of (a "transfer") unless the offer and sale is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available and complied with, and that, if any such transfer or offer thereof is proposed to be effected pursuant to any such exemption, then the holder of the Class D Common Units (or the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) must, prior to such transfer, furnish to Regency and its transfer agent such certifications, legal opinions or other information as they may reasonably require to confirm that such transfer is being made pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities law. 

   

 (b) The Partners acknowledge the following: 

   

 (i) The following legend may be placed on the certificates representing the Class D Common Units (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof). 

   

THE UNITS (THE "UNITS") EVIDENCED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND, ACCORDINGLY,
MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE. BY
ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, THE HOLDER AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT DISTRIBUTE, OFFER,
RESELL, PLEDGE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER (INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY, A
"TRANSFER") THE UNITS EVIDENCED HEREBY, EXCEPT (A) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (B) PURSUANT TO AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT SUCH AS THE EXEMPTION
SET FORTH IN RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (IF AVAILABLE). IF
THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS TO BE MADE OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (A) ABOVE,
THE HOLDER MUST, PRIOR TO SUCH TRANSFER, FURNISH TO THE ISSUER AND THE
TRANSFER AGENT SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL OPINIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS
THEY MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS BEING MADE
PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF 

   ##### 

  

    

THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY STATE OR FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS. 

 

The legend set forth in the paragraph above shall be removed when the Class D
Common Units (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof)
represented by such certificate are disposed of pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, the certification, opinion
of counsel or other information referred to above has been provided to
Regency, or, in the opinion of counsel to Regency, the same are no longer
required under the applicable requirements of such securities laws. The unit
certificates shall also bear any additional legends required by the Regency
Partnership Agreement or by applicable federal, state or foreign securities
laws, which legends may be removed when, in the opinion of counsel to
Regency, the same are no longer required under the Regency Partnership
Agreement or by the applicable requirements of such securities laws, as the
case may be. 

    

 (ii) Stop transfer instructions have been or will be placed with respect to the Class D Common Units (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) so as to restrict the distribution, resale, pledge, hypothecation or other transfer thereof in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (iii) The legend and stop transfer instructions described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above will be replaced with respect to any new certificate issued upon presentment by the undersigned of a certificate for transfer. 

   

 (c) The Partners are aware that Regency has relied on the representations and warranties of the Partners set forth in _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.5_ and on the covenants of the Partners set forth in this _Section 5.9_ in determining that an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, applicable state securities laws and the rules promulgated thereunder is available for the issuance of the Class D Common Units (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) by Regency to the Partners, and that, but for such representations, no issuance of the Class D Common Units (and the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof) would be made by Regency to the Partners pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.10 _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement until the first to occur of the Closing and any termination hereof, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, CDM and the Partners agree that they will not, and it will cause their respective managers, directors, officers, employees, consultants, Affiliates and other agents and representatives (including any investment banking, legal or accounting firm retained by either Partner or CDM or any of their Agents and any individual member or employee of the foregoing) (each, an "Agent") not to: (a) initiate, solicit or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, acquisition, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, equity investment or similar transaction involving, or any purchase or sale of all or any substantial portion of the assets or any partnership interest, membership interest or equity securities of, the Partners or CDM (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as a "Proposal"); (b) engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any substantive discussions with, any Person relating to a Proposal; (c) otherwise cooperate in any effort or attempt to make, 

   ##### 

  

 

implement or accept a Proposal; or (d) enter into a contract, arrangement or
agreement with any Person relating to a Proposal. The Partners and CDM
immediately shall cease, and cause to be terminated, all activities,
discussions and negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with
respect to any Proposal and, to the extent permitted by the applicable
confidentiality or similar agreement governing such activities, discussions
or negotiations, require all third parties (other than Regency) to such
activities, discussions or negotiations to return to CDM or to destroy
all confidential information of CDM or of either Partner as it relates to
CDM. Each of the Partners and CDM shall cause each of their respective Agents
to comply with the provisions of this  _Section 5.10_, and any violation of
this _Section 5.10_ by any such Agent shall be deemed a breach of this
_Section 5.10_ by the Partners and CDM. The Partners shall not otherwise
sell, transfer, pledge, assign, convey, gift, hypothecate or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, any of their Partnership Interests or grant any
proxy, or enter into any voting arrangement, with respect thereto.

CDM shall also deliver to Regency, simultaneously with such certificate, payoff letters executed by each of the lenders or other financing sources with respect to such Closing Indebtedness and the lessors under each Compression Operating Lease, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Regency (the "Payoff Letters"). Each Payoff Letter shall contain (x) the payoff amount, including principal, accrued but unpaid interest, fees, prepayment costs or penalties, make-whole premiums or similar costs (including a per 

   ##### 

  

    

diem amount or calculation through the Closing Date) of the Closing
Indebtedness to which it relates and that will be due and payable in order to
extinguish the Closing Indebtedness immediately after the Closing, and shall
authorize CDM, the Surviving Company and Regency, following the payment in

to acquire such equipment under the Compression Operating Leases as of the
Closing Date as set forth in the Payoff Letters is referred to herein as the
"Payoff Amount". Immediately after the Closing, Regency shall cause the
Payoff Amount to be paid as contemplated by the Payoff Letters. 

  

 Section 5.13 _Financing Cooperation_. CDM hereby consents to Regencys inclusion of any audited or unaudited financial statements relating to and prepared by CDM, as reasonably requested by Regency, in any financing or in any filings that Regency desires to make with the SEC.

 Section 5.15 _Post-Closing Access to Records_. Regency shall preserve and keep, or shall cause the Surviving Company to preserve and keep, a copy of the books and records of CDM in existence as of the Closing Date for a period of at least seven years after the Closing Date.

Regency or the Surviving Company shall provide to the Partners, at no cost or expense to Regency or the Surviving Company, reasonable access to such books and records during normal business hours upon written request that states an appropriate business reason to access such books and records as remain in Regencys or the Surviving Companys possession in connection with matters relating to the business or operations of CDM conducted on or before the Closing Date. All costs and expenses incurred by any Partner in connection with such access shall be paid by such Partner, and all such information obtained by any Partner in connection with such access shall be held in confidence, except as required by Applicable Laws, and then only after giving the disclosing person an opportunity to seek an appropriate remedy to the extent reasonably practicable. During such seven-year period, the Partners shall provide to Regency 

   ##### 

  

 

and the Surviving Company, at no charge to the Partners, reasonable access to
the books and records of the Partners during normal business hours upon
written request that states an appropriate business reason to access such
books and records, that relate to the business or operations of CDM conducted
on or before the Closing Date. For the period beginning on and including the
Closing Date until the completion of the annual audit for Regencys
financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2008, the Partners
shall cause CDM MAX, LLC to provide to Regency and the Surviving Company, at
no charge to CDM MAX, LLC, reasonable access to the financial information of
CDM MAX, LLC relating to periods ended on or prior to the date of
this Agreement during normal business hours upon written request that are
reasonably necessary in order for Regency properly to prepare all filings
with the SEC regarding financial statements of CDM in accordance with Section
3-05 of Regulation S-X. All costs and expenses incurred by Regency
in connection with the access referred to above shall be paid by Regency, and
all such information obtained by Regency in connection with such access shall
be held in confidence, except as required by Applicable Laws, and then only
after giving the disclosing person an opportunity to seek an appropriate
remedy to the extent reasonably practicable. 

   

 Section 5.16 _Insurance, Etc_. Effective as of the Closing, so-called tail coverage shall be purchased under CDMs directors and officers insurance policy existing as of the date of this Agreement to extend coverage for the Persons theretofore covered thereby for a period of at least six years after Closing as to all claims based upon occurrences prior to Closing, and all premiums and other expenses associated with such tail coverage shall be at Regencys or the Surviving Companys expense. In addition, notwithstanding the Merger, any indemnification, contribution, exculpation and reimbursement rights of any such Persons accrued through the Closing Date, whether under the CDM Partnership Agreement or under any contract identified in _Section 5.16_ of the CDM Disclosure Schedule, shall not be terminated and no rights thereunder impaired as a result of the Merger, but those rights shall survive the Closing and continue in effect thereafter in accordance with their terms with respect to events and conditions in existence at or prior to the Closing. The provisions of this _Section 5.16_ are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, any current or former officer or director (or person exercising equivalent functions) of CDM and his or her heirs, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have had by contract or otherwise. 

  

 Section 5.17 _Certain Post-Closing Sales_. Regency agrees that if, on or prior to the earlier of the two year anniversary of the Closing Date and the date that all of the Class D Common Units received by the Partners pursuant to the Merger have been sold in a transaction resulting in a basis adjustment under Section 743 of the Code for the benefit of the transferee(s), Regency and its Affiliates either (i) dispose of any equity interests of the Surviving Company or (ii) dispose of any assets acquired by Regency pursuant to the Merger and such disposition accelerates any "built-in gain" (as defined in Treasury Regulation 1.704-3(a)(3)(ii)) in any such asset with respect to the Class D Common Units received by the Partners in the Merger in excess of an aggregate of $10.0 million (it being the intent of the Parties that Regency shall not be obligated to make any payment or take any of the following actions contemplated in this _Section 5.17_ except to the extent of the excess of any accelerated built-in gain over an aggregate of $10.0 million, and the Partners shall be liable for all applicable Taxes in respect of such $10.0 million of accelerated built-in gain recognized without any obligations on Regency to take the following 

   ##### 

  

 

actions as contemplated by this _Section 5.17_), then Regency shall take the
following actions: (i) promptly take all actions necessary or appropriate
under the Partnership Agreement Amendment to convert the Required Units into
Common Units; (ii) promptly take the actions contemplated by, and in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of, the Registration
Rights Agreements as they relate to the Common Units so converted so that the
applicable Holders (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreements)
allocated such accelerated built-in gains may sell such Common Units under an
effective registration statement as contemplated therein as soon as
reasonably practicable, and in taking such actions, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared
effective so that the Holders may receive proceeds from sales of Common Units
prior to the next estimated tax payment date after the disposition that
results in recognition of such accelerated built-in gain, provided that if
such disposition is within 15 days of such tax payment date, then the next
estimated tax payment date; (iii) waive any restrictions contained in
the Lock-up Agreements with respect to the sale of such Required Units or
Common Units; and (iv) to the extent rates other than long-term federal
capital gains rates apply to the accelerated built-in gain allocable to the
Partners as a result of such disposition, promptly indemnify the Partners
for an amount equal to the product of (x) the amount of such accelerated
built-in gain treated as other than long-term capital gain because such
assets had a holding period of one year or less at the time of disposition,
times (y) the excess, if any, of the sum of (1) the highest marginal
federal income tax rate applicable to individuals plus (2) 67% of the highest
marginal state and city income tax rate applicable to individuals in the city
of New York, over the sum of (3) the maximum federal income tax rate for net
capital gains of an individual for the year such built-in gain is recognized
plus (4) 67% of the maximum New York state and city income tax rate for net
capital gains of an individual for the year such built-in gain is recognized.
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions in this _Section 5.17_, in no
event shall the provisions of this _Section 5.17_ apply to any of the Class D
Common Units (or Common Units) constituting part of the Escrow Fund. For
purposes of this _Section 5.17_, the term "Required Units" means that number
of Class D Common Units as is reasonably expected to be required to be
converted into Common Units so that a holder thereof may, upon a prompt sale
of such Common Units, realize sufficient net proceeds therefrom, on an after-
tax basis, in an amount equal to the federal income tax resulting from
the recognition of such built-in gain as a result of any actions by Regency
or its Affiliates described in clause (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of
this _Section 5.17_. Regency shall provide the Partners with prompt notice
of each sale of interests in the Surviving Company or assets of the Surviving
Company that is reasonably likely to accelerate any built-in gain in any such
asset of the Surviving Company with respect to the Class D Common
Units received by the Partners in the Merger, and such notice shall describe
such sale in reasonable detail, but in no event shall the failure to provide
such prompt notice be construed to affect any rights of Regency under this
Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.18 _Use of Name_. After the Closing, notwithstanding that each of the Surviving Company and CDM MAX, LLC may continue to use "CDM" in its respective name, the other such company shall be entitled to use "CDM" in its name and in its business (including, in the case of the Surviving Company, "CDM Resource Management"), and each such company may continue to use its logo consistent with past practice. Each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates, including, in the case of the Partners, CDM MAX, LLC, to take such actions as may be reasonably requested by any Party in order to carry out this _Section 5.18_.

CONDITIONS

 (d) At any time after the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred and be continuing as of the Closing Date any change, event, occurrence, state of facts or development that individually or in the aggregate has had or is reasonably likely to have a Regency Material Adverse Effect. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.3 _Conditions to Obligation of Regency and Merger Sub to Effect the Merger_. The obligations of Regency and Merger Sub to effect the Merger and otherwise to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the fulfillment or waiver by Regency at or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions: 

   

 (a) CDM and each of the Partners shall have performed, in all material respects, its covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date; 

   

 (b) the representations and warranties of CDM and each of the Partners contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such representation or warranty of CDM or any Partner that is qualified by a materiality standard or a Material Adverse Effect qualification shall not be further qualified by materiality for purposes of this _Section 6.3(b))_ on and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of such date, except to the extent that any such representation or warranty is made as of a specified date, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such specified date;

 (d) At any time after the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred and be continuing as of the Closing Date any change, event, occurrence, state of facts or development that individually or in the aggregate has had or is reasonably likely to have a CDM Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 Section 6.4 _Breakage Fee_. If the Merger and the Closing hereunder fail to occur on or before the date that is 35 days after the date of this Agreement, then Regency shall be responsible for the payment of the Breakage Fee as contemplated in the remaining provisions of this _Section 6.4_ , on the terms and conditions set forth herein. If the Merger and the Closing hereunder fail to occur solely as a result of a breach by Regency or Merger Sub of one or more of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in this Agreement, including  _Section 4.13_, then, upon termination of this Agreement by CDM as permitted under  _Section 7.3_, and so long as each of the conditions to Closing in _Section 6.1(a)_ and  _(b)_ have then been satisfied and CDM is prepared and able to satisfy in good faith the conditions in _Section 6.3_, Regency shall pay to CDM, as compensation for such breach, the sum of $15,000,000 (the "Breakage Fee"). In furtherance of the foregoing, if the Merger and the Closing hereunder fail to occur on or before the date that is 35 days after the date of this Agreement and this Agreement has not been terminated, Regency shall deposit, within two Business Days after such date, $15,000,000 in cash with the Escrow Agent to be held subject to an escrow agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit K_ (the "Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement"). Once the Breakage Fee 

   ##### 

  

 

has been deposited under the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement, claims by CDM
under the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement as contemplated hereby shall be the
sole remedy by CDM and the Partners against Regency and Merger Sub for all
breaches under this Agreement, subject to the last sentence of this _Section
6.4_. The Parties agree to take commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
escrow agreement to be entered into by the Escrow Agent and the Parties as
soon as practicable and, in any event, on or prior to the date that is
10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement. Upon such termination of
this Agreement by CDM pursuant to _Section 7.3_, CDM shall be entitled to
instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to CDM such escrowed Breakage Fee, upon
the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement (a "Partner Claim Notice"),
stating with particularity the nature of its claim for the Breakage Fee and
the factual basis for which CDM is entitled to the Breakage Fee under this
Agreement. Regency may within seven Business Days after receiving a Partner
Claim Notice give notice to CDM and the Escrow Agent of any objection thereto
(the "Regency Objection Notice"). If Regency fails to deliver timely a
Regency Objection Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute to CDM the
escrowed Breakage Fee, along with the earned interest thereon, all in
accordance with the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement. If Regency timely delivers
a Regency Objection Notice, then Regency and CDM shall promptly, and in
any event within 10 days after delivery of the Regency Objection Notice, meet
to attempt to resolve any disputes with respect thereto. Any unresolved
disputes shall be resolved in the manner referred to in the Escrow Agreement.
If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than in accordance with
_Section 7.3_ or if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.3_
but CDM fails to make a Partner Claim Notice within five Business Days after
such termination or the Partners and Regency agree that a breach by Regency
or Merger Sub was not the sole reason Closing did not occur on or before
January 31, 2008, then the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Regency
the escrowed Breakage Fee, along with the earned interest thereon. Regency,
on the one hand, and the Partners, on the other hand, shall each be
responsible for 50% of the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent. Payment of
the Breakage Fee to CDM is intended as liquidated damages, and not as a
penalty, which the Parties agree to be a reasonable amount for liquidated
damages under this Agreement, given that it would be impractical and
extremely difficult to determine actual damages under such circumstances. If
the Breakage Fee is due and payable in accordance with this _Section 6.4_
and CDM receives the Breakage Fee by either (x) delivery thereof from the
Escrow Agent under the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement or (y) a direct payment
from CDM, then the Breakage Fee shall eliminate any other remedy available to
CDM and the Partners against Regency and Merger Sub for all breaches under
this Agreement by Regency and Merger Sub. Upon any such payment of the
Breakage Fee by Regency to CDM, CDM and Regency shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to distribute to Regency all amounts held by the Escrow Agent under the
Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement. If the Breakage Fee is distributed by
the Escrow Agent to Regency pursuant to the terms of the Breakage Fee Escrow
Agreement, CDM and the Partners shall have all rights and remedies against
Regency and Merger Sub for any liability for any material breach by Regency
or Merger Sub as contemplated by _Section 7.5;_ _provided, however,_ that in
the event the Breakage Fee is so distributed by Escrow Agent to Regency
solely because CDM fails to timely deliver a Partner Claim Notice, then
Regency and Merger Sub, together, shall not be liable under this Agreement
for an aggregate dollar amount in excess of the dollar amount of the Breakage
Fee.

TERMINATION  

  

 Section 7.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written consent of CDM and Regency. 

  

 Section 7.2 _Termination by Regency or CDM_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of Regency or CDM if: 

   

 (a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by January 31, 2008, as such date may be extended in accordance with _Section 5.7_ (the "Termination Date"); _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (a) shall not be available to Regency if either Regency or Merger Sub shall have failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement in any manner and such failure shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date; and _provided, further however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (a) shall not be available to CDM if CDM or either Partner shall have failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement in any manner and such failure shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date; 

   

 (b) a court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Agency shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;  _provided, however,_ that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b) (which, if such Party is CDM, shall be deemed also to include each Partner for satisfying the remainder of this clause) shall have complied with _Section 5.2_ and, with respect to other matters not covered by _Section 5.2_, shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to remove such injunction, order or decree. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Termination by CDM_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the general partner of CDM if Regency or Merger Sub shall have breached any representation or warranty or failed to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or any representation or warranty of Regency or Merger Sub shall have become untrue, in any case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ would not be satisfied (assuming for purposes of this _Section 7.3_ that the references in _Section 6.2_ to "Closing Date" mean the date of termination pursuant to this _Section 7.3_), and such breach shall not be curable, or, if curable, shall not have been cured within 10 Business Days after written notice of such breach is given to Regency by CDM (but in no event after the Termination Date); _provided, however,_ that CDM may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.3_ if it or either Partner is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement such that Regency would then be entitled to terminate this Agreement under _Section 7.4_ (without giving effect to the proviso in _Section 7.4_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Regency is required to deposit the $15,000,000 with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of

 Section 7.5 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _Article 7_, all obligations of the Parties shall terminate, except the obligations of the Parties pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Regency Letter Agreement, this  _Section 7.5_, the fourth, ninth and tenth sentence of _Section 5.3_, _Section 5.6_ and _Section 6.4_ and except for the provisions of _Sections 10.1_,  _10.2_ , _10.3_ , _10.5_ , _10.7_ , _10.8_ , _10.9_ , _10.11_ ,  _10.12_ , _10.14_ and _10.15_ , _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any liability for any material breach by such Party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies of the nonbreaching Parties under this Agreement, at law or in equity, shall be preserved, subject, however, to the terms of _Section 6.4_.

 (vi) The aggregate amount of Damages and other monetary liabilities and obligations for which the Partners are liable under this Agreement shall not exceed the Final Purchase Price. 

   

 (c) After Closing, except as expressly otherwise provided in _Article 9_ of this Agreement or in another agreement in writing, the indemnity provided in this _Section 8.2_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Regency Indemnified Parties against the Partners at law or in equity under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than for fraud; provided, however, that the foregoing exclusion for fraud shall not be deemed a waiver of any defenses that may be available in respect of actions or claims for fraud, including defenses of statutes of limitations or limitations of damages. The Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. 

   

 (d) The Regency Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under _Section 8.2_ (the "Regency Party") shall give the Partners prompt written notice of any third party claim that may give rise to any indemnity obligation under this Section, together with the estimated amount of such claim, and the Partners shall have the right to assume the defense of any such claim through counsel of their own choosing, by so notifying the Regency Party within 30 days of receipt of the Regency Partys written notice. Failure of the Regency Party to give prompt notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent of actual prejudice. If the Regency Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense assumed by the Partners, it may do so at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ that the Regency Party may have one counsel paid for by the Partners if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Regency Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Partners and the Regency Party that would make such representation advisable. If the Partners fail to assume any such defense, they shall be liable to the extent provided under _Section 8.2(a)_ for all reasonable costs and expenses of defending such claim incurred by the Regency Party, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel if it is ultimately determined that the Partners are liable for such claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. No Partner shall, without the prior written consent of the Regency Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand on a basis that would result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Regency

Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof or if such settlement or
compromise does not include an unconditional release of the Regency Party for
any liability arising out of such claim or demand or any related claim or
demand. The Regency Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
each of the Partners, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any such claim or demand on a basis that would result in the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the
future activity or conduct of such Partner or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof or if such settlement or compromise does not include an
unconditional release of such Partner for any liability arising out of such
claim or demand or any related claim or demand. 

   

 (e) The Partners shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such third-party claim if: 

   

 (i) the third-party claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief (except where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary damages); 

   

 (ii) the third-party claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; or 

   

 (iii) the third-party claim would reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that are more than twice the amount then indemnifiable by the Partners pursuant to this _Article 8_; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.2(d)_, if such expected amount of Damages exceeds the amount then so indemnifiable by the Partners but is less than twice the amount then so indemnifiable, then, subject to a customary joint defense agreement that each of the Partners and the relevant Regency Indemnified Party shall in good faith negotiate and enter into together, the Partners and the relevant Regency Indemnified Party shall equally and mutually control the defense of such third party claim, provided, that if such joint defense is prohibited by Applicable Laws, then, with respect to such third-party claim, whoever has the greater exposure, as reasonably determined, as between the indemnification obligations under _Section 8.2_ as it relates to the Partners, on the one hand, and the potential for Damages that are not subject to indemnification under _Section 8.2_ as it relates to the Regency Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall be entitled to control the defense of such third party claim. 

   

If the Partners are not entitled to assume or share such defense, they may
nonetheless participate in such defense at their sole cost and expense. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Regency_. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in _Article 9_ below with respect to tax matters and subject to the further provisions hereof, Regency and Merger Sub shall jointly and severally defend, indemnify and hold the Partners and their respective Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns, and their respective officers, directors, 

   ##### 

  

    

managers, employees, agents, and representatives, and each of their heirs,
executors, successors and assigns (the "Partner Indemnified Parties"),
harmless from and against and in respect of: 

   

 (i) Damages that arise out of any breach of any of the covenants or other agreements of Regency or Merger Sub in this Agreement (other than the covenants, agreements and indemnities in _Article 9_, which shall be subject to  _Article 9_); and 

   

 (ii) Damages that arise out of any breach of any of the representations and warranties of Regency and Merger Sub in this Agreement (other than the Regency Tax Representations, which shall be subject to _Article 9_). 

   

 (b) The foregoing obligation to indemnify the Partner Indemnified Parties shall be subject to each of the following qualifications and limitations: 

   

 (i) The indemnification obligations of Regency and Merger Sub under _Section 8.3(a)_ shall terminate upon expiration of the applicable Survival Period. 

   

 (ii) No reimbursement or payment for any Damages asserted against Regency under  _Section 8.3(a)_ above (other than in connection with the Regency Specified Representations, which shall not be subject to any of the limits in this clause (ii), and other than the Regency Tax Representations, which shall be subject to  _Section 9.1(c)_) shall be required unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of such Damages equals or exceeds $3,250,000 (the "Regency Threshold"), in which case the Partner Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification and then only to the extent the cumulative aggregate amount of Damages, as finally determined, exceeds $3,250,000; _provided_ that any Damages that individually (which, for this purpose, shall be combined with all Damages based upon the same or substantially related set of facts) total less than $50,000 ("De Minimis Partner Losses") shall be excluded in their entirety and Regency in no event shall have any liability hereunder to any Partner Indemnified Parties for any such De Minimis Partner Losses. The limitations described in the _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ shall not apply to Regencys indemnity obligations under _Section 5.3_. 

   

 (iii) For all determinations made after the Closing regarding the existence of a breach of any of Regencys or Merger Subs representations and warranties in  _Article 4_ (other the Regency Tax Representations), for the purposes of  _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ or the amount of any Damages with respect thereto (other than in each such instance the representations and warranties in _Section 4.6(a)_ , which shall not be subject to the deemed modifications contemplated in this subparagraph (iii)), all such representations and warranties that are qualified by materiality or by reference to Regency Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be not so qualified. 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the aggregate amount required to be paid by Regency and Merger 

   ##### 

  

    

Sub to the Partner Indemnified Parties for all Damages asserted against
Regency and Merger Sub under  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (but solely as it relates
to covenants and agreements that by their terms do not contemplate
performance after the Closing; all other covenants and agreements shall be
subject only to the limit specified in clause (v)) and  _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_
(other than in connection with any of the Regency Specified Representations,
which shall be subject only to the limit specified in clause (v)) shall not
exceed $118,250,000. 

   

 (v) The aggregate amount of Damages and other monetary liabilities and obligations for which Regency and Merger Sub are liable under this Agreement shall not exceed the Final Purchase Price. 

   

 (c) After Closing, except as expressly otherwise provided in _Article 9_ of this Agreement or in another agreement in writing, the indemnity provided in this _Section 8.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Partner Indemnified Parties against Regency at law or in equity under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than for fraud; provided, however, that the foregoing exclusion for fraud shall not be deemed a waiver of any defenses that may be available in respect of actions or claims for fraud, including defenses of statutes of limitations or limitations of damages. The Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. 

   

 (d) The Partner Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under _Section 8.3_ (the "Partner Party") shall give Regency prompt written notice of any third party claim that may give rise to any indemnity obligation under this Section, together with the estimated amount of such claim, and Regency shall have the right to assume the defense of any such claim through counsel of its own choosing, by so notifying the Partner Party within 30 days of receipt of the Partner Partys written notice. Failure of the Partner Party to give prompt notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent of actual prejudice. If the Partner Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense assumed by Regency it may do so at its sole cost and expense,  _provided_ that the Partner Party may have one counsel paid for by Regency if, in the reasonable opinion to the Partner Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Partner Party and Regency that would make such representation advisable If Regency fails to assume any such defense, it shall be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses of defending such claim incurred by the Partner Party, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel if it is ultimately determined that Regency is liable for such claims pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Neither Regency nor the Surviving Company shall, without the prior written consent of the Partner Party, which consent shall not be 

   ##### 

  

    

unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, settle, compromise or offer to
settle or compromise any such claim or demand on a basis that would result in
the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict
the future activity or conduct of the Partner Party or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof or if such settlement or compromise does not include an
unconditional release of the Partner Party for any liability arising out of
such claim or demand or any related claim or demand. The Partner Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of Regency, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, settle, compromise or offer
to settle or compromise any such claim or demand on a basis that would result
in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would
restrict the future activity or conduct of Regency or the Surviving Company
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof or if such settlement or
compromise does not include an unconditional release of Regency and the
Surviving Company for any liability arising out of such claim or demand or
any related claim or demand. 

   

 (e) Regency shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such third-party claim if: 

   

 (i) the third-party claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief (except where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary damages); 

   

 (ii) the third-party claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; or 

   

 (iii) the third-party claim would reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that are more than twice the amount then indemnifiable by Regency pursuant to this _Article 8_; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.3(d)_, if such expected amount of Damages exceeds the amount then so indemnifiable by Regency but is less than twice the amount then so indemnifiable, then, subject to a customary joint defense agreement that Regency and the relevant Partner Party shall in good faith negotiate and enter into together, Regency and the relevant Partner Party shall equally and mutually control the defense of such third party claim; provided, that if such joint defense is prohibited by Applicable Laws, then, with respect to such third-party claim, whoever has the greater exposure, as reasonably determined, as between the indemnification obligations under _Section 8.3_ as it relates to Regency and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the potential for Damages that are not subject to indemnification under _Section 8.3_ as it relates to the Partner Party, on the other hand, shall be entitled to control the defense of such third party claim. 

   

If Regency is not entitled to assume or share such defense, it may nonetheless
participate in such defense at its sole cost and expense. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Other Indemnification Matters_. 

   

 (a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this  _Article 8_ shall be computed net of any insurance or other proceeds actually received by the indemnified Person in connection with such Damages. Each of the Regency Indemnified Persons and each of the Partner Indemnified Persons shall pursue in good faith claims under any applicable insurance policies and against other third parties who may reasonably be expected to be responsible for such Damages. A Party subject to indemnifying another Person under this Agreement may defer such payment obligation pending resolution of any claims that are still being pursued by such indemnified party as 

   ##### 

  

    

contemplated in the immediately preceding sentence; however, if any such claim
is still being pursued one year after the date of the Closing, such
indemnifying Party shall nonetheless make, or cause to be made, such
indemnification payment, which payment shall be subject to prompt
reimbursement to the extent of the amount, if any, ultimately collected by
such indemnified person prior to December 31, 2011. 

   

 (b) Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing, the rights of Regency under  _Section 1.9_ as it relates to the Escrow Fund, the indemnification provisions in this  _Article 8_, and the provisions in _Article 9_ shall represent the exclusive remedies of the Parties under this Agreement after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as specified in the immediately preceding sentence (including as may otherwise be agreed in writing) or for fraud, after Closing, no Party shall have any liability, and no Party shall make any claim, for any Damages or other matter (and Regency, Merger Sub, CDM and the Partners hereby waive any right of contribution against the other), under or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger. EXCEPT AS MAY OTHERWISE BE AGREED EXPRESSLY IN WRITING, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING THAT MAY BE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN OR UNDER ANY LEGAL CONSTRUCT, NO RECOURSE UNDER OR BY REASON OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE HAD AGAINST ANY FORMER, CURRENT OR FUTURE OWNER, PARTNER, MEMBER, MANAGER, AFFILIATE (OTHER THAN CDM) OR ASSIGNEE OF THE PARTNERS OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON RELATED TO OR ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THE FOREGOING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WHETHER BY THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY ASSESSMENT OR BY ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE PROCEEDING, OR BY VIRTUE OF ANY STATUTE, REGULATION OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS, IT BEING EXPRESSLY AGREED AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT NO PERSONAL LIABILITY WHATSOEVER SHALL ATTACH TO, BE IMPOSED ON OR OTHERWISE BE INCURRED BY ANY FORMER, CURRENT OR FUTURE OWNER, PARTNER, MEMBER, MANAGER, AFFILIATE (OTHER THAN CDM) OR ASSIGNEE OF THE PARTNERS OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PERSON RELATED TO OR ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THE FOREGOING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AS SUCH, FOR ANY OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTNERS HEREUNDER.

LIMIT A PARTYS RIGHT TO RECOVERY UNDER _ARTICLE 8_  FOR ANY DAMAGES TO THE
EXTENT THAT THEY RELATE TO A BREACH OF _SECTION 3.7(a)_ or  _(b)_ OR _SECTION
4.6(b)_ , PROVIDED THAT ANY SUCH DAMAGES SHALL BE CALCULATED, (A) WITH
RESPECT TO ANY SUCH BREACH BY CDM AND THE PARTNERS, TO EQUAL THE DIFFERENCE
IN VALUE THAT REGENCY PAID FOR THE PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS ASSUMING NO SUCH
BREACH AND THE VALUE THAT A REASONABLY PRUDENT PERSON WOULD HAVE ATTRIBUTED
TO THE PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SUCH BREACH, ASSUMING

OF REGENCY AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2007.

ARTICLE 9 

   

TAX MATTERS  

  

 Section 9.1 _Tax Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) The Partners shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold Regency and its Affiliates harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of CDM and its Subsidiaries (and any Taxes of the Partners or any other Person for which either CDM or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable by contract, operation of law, or otherwise) with regard to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Period") and the portion ending on the Closing Date of any taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") and (ii) all Taxes that are the subject of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.10_ of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) With respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of Taxes attributable to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be calculated as though the tax year terminated as of the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of a Tax not based on income, receipts, proceeds, profits or similar items, such Taxes shall be equal to the amount of Tax for the taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the beginning of the taxable period through the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the taxable period. 

   

 (c) Regency shall indemnify and hold the Partners and their Affiliates harmless from and against (i) any and all Taxes of, or pertaining or attributable to, CDM and/or the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period or portion of a Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date and (ii) all Taxes that are the subject of a breach of any of the Regency Tax Representations. 

   

 (d) The indemnities provided in this _Section 9.1_ shall survive the Closing until the earlier of (i) a period of 90 days following the applicable statutes of limitation plus any extensions or waivers thereof and (ii) December 31, 2011. 

   

 (e) The tax indemnification rights, obligations, and procedures set forth in this Article shall in no way be limited or modified by the indemnification provisions of  _Article 8_, other than _Section 8.2(b)(vi)_ and _Section 8.3(b)(v)_. 

  

 Section 9.2 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. 

   

 (a) The Partners shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for CDM for all Pre-Closing Periods, and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. At least 20 days prior to the due date (including any extensions) of such Tax Returns, the Partners shall furnish a copy of such Tax Return to 

   ##### 

  

    

Regency. The Partners shall permit Regency to review and comment on such Tax
Returns. 

   

 (b) Regency shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any post-Closing Tax Returns (any Tax Return that is required to be filed for CDM or its assets with respect to any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date). 

   

 (c) Regency shall prepare any Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period. The Partners shall be responsible for Taxes of CDM relating to the portion of the Straddle Period occurring before and on the Closing Date, except to the extent accrued on the Financial Statements. Regency shall deliver, at least 20 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (including any extension) to the Partners a statement setting forth the amount of Tax that each Partner owes and copies of such Straddle Return. The Partners shall have the right to review such Tax Returns and the allocation of taxable income, if any, and liability for Taxes and to suggest to Regency any reasonable changes to such Tax Returns no later than 10 days prior to the date for the filing of such Tax Returns. The Partners and Regency agree to consult and to attempt to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such Tax Returns with respect to a Straddle Period and allocation of taxable income, if any, and liability for Taxes and mutually to consent to the filing as promptly as possible of such Tax Returns. Not later than five days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns, the Partners shall pay or cause to be paid to Regency an amount equal to the Taxes as agreed to by Regency and the Partners as being owed by the Partners. If Regency and the Partners cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed by the Partners with respect to a Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period, the Partners shall pay or cause to be paid to Regency the amount of Taxes reasonably determined by the Partners to be owed by the Partners, and Regency shall file the Tax Return and pay the entire Tax shown to be due on such Tax Return. Within 10 days after such payment, the Partners and Regency shall refer the matter to an independent "Big-Four" accounting firm agreed to by Regency and the Partners to arbitrate the dispute. The Partners and Regency shall equally share the fees and expenses of such accounting firm and its determination as to the amounts owed by the Partners and Regency with respect to a Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period shall be binding on the Partners and Regency. Within five days after the determination by such accounting firm, if necessary, the appropriate Party shall pay the other Party any amount, including interest thereon, that is determined by such accounting firm to be owed. 

   

 (d) Regency and the Partners agree to provide such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the other Party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes, and each will retain and provide the requesting Party with any records or information that may be relevant to such return, audit or examination, proceedings or determination. Any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 9.2(d)_ or pursuant to any other Section hereof providing for the sharing of information relating to or review of any Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes shall be kept confidential by the Parties hereto in accordance with _Section 5.3_ and the Regency Confidentiality Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 9.3 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_.

 (b) With respect to any such Tax Claim, the Partners, at the Partners expense, shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel). The Partners shall permit Regency to participate in (but not control), at Regencys sole cost and expense, such proceeding through counsel chosen by Regency and shall keep Regency reasonably informed as to the status of such proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partners and Regency shall jointly control all proceedings in connection with any Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes for a Straddle Period, and all costs and expenses related to such proceedings shall be borne 50% by Regency and 50% by the Partners. No Party shall settle a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of CDM for a Straddle Period without the other Partys prior written consent, and the Partners shall not settle a Tax Claim for a Pre-Closing Period without Regencys prior written consent (neither of which consents may be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and each of which consents shall be considered to be unreasonably withheld if such settlement has no adverse effect on the other Party). 

   

 (c) Regency and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Surviving Company), on the one hand, and the Partners, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and, at the contesting Partys request and expense, the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees and representatives available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Tax Refunds and Credits_. Any refund or credits of Taxes paid or payable that are attributable to CDM for any Pre-Closing Period (or for any Straddle Period to the extent allocable (determined in a manner consistent with _Section 9.1(b)_) to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date) shall be for the account of the Partners. Any refunds or credits of Taxes paid or payable that are attributable to CDM for any other taxable period shall be for the account of Regency. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, the Parties shall treat any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for federal income tax purposes. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes, if any, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne 50% by Regency and 50% by the Partners. The Partners shall file, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes. Regency shall pay the Partners one- half of the amount shown as due on such Tax Returns, as determined 

   ##### 

  

 

in accordance with this Agreement, and shall, to the extent required by
Applicable Laws, join in the execution of any such Tax Return. The Partners
shall cooperate with Regency to reduce or eliminate any Transfer Tax. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Transfer Taxes" shall mean transfer, documentary,
sales, use, registration and other such Taxes (including all applicable real
estate transfer taxes). 

   

 Section 9.7 _Closing Tax Certificate_. At the Closing, each Partner shall deliver to Regency a certificate, signed under penalties of perjury (i) stating it is not (and no Partner is) a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate, (ii) providing its U.S. Employer Identification Number and (iii) providing its address, all pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Tax Covenants_. For federal income Tax purposes, the Parties agree to report the Merger as a transaction described in Code Section 721 on all Tax Returns. The Parties agree to take no action inconsistent with such treatment.
