being provided) in writing to the Partners, and such notice shall state with particularity the
nature and amount of the Claim and the basis for which Regency is entitled to compensation for such
Claim under this Agreement. A Claim Notice may instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to Regency, or
its designee, such number of Class&nbsp;D Common Units (or Common Units if such Class&nbsp;D Common Units
have been converted into Common Units), and such other portion of the Escrow Fund, as shall satisfy

Units are convertible or the then applicable Market Price of the Common Units if such Class&nbsp;D
Common Units have been converted into Common Units), upon the terms set forth in the Escrow
Agreement. The Partners may within 15 Business Days after receiving a Claim Notice give notice to
Regency and the Escrow Agent of any objection thereto (the &#147;<B>Objection Notice</B>&#148;). If the Partners
fail to deliver timely an Objection Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Regency such
assets and property from the Escrow Fund as shall satisfy such Claim described in such Claim
Notice, all in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. If the Partners timely deliver an Objection
Notice, then Regency and the Partners shall promptly, and in any event within 10
days after delivery of the Objection Notice, meet to attempt to resolve any disputes with
respect thereto. Any unresolved disputes shall be resolved in the manner referred to in the Escrow
Agreement. For purposes of the foregoing, &#147;<B>Market Price</B>&#148; means, with respect to each distribution
from the Escrow Fund, the average of the closing sales prices, regular way, of a Common Unit, as
such price is reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (or the principal securities exchange on
which the Common Units are then traded) by Bloomberg Financial Markets, over the 10 trading days

date that the applicable Objection Notice period has lapsed or (z)&nbsp;the date that is one year after
the Closing Date, for purposes of the third to last sentence of this <U>Section&nbsp;1.9</U>. If, at
any time Escrowed Units are to be distributed out of the Escrow Fund to Regency in satisfaction of

in which the transaction of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to

reasonably likely to have a Regency Material Adverse Effect. Each of Regency and Merger Sub has
all requisite partnership or company power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties

Merger Sub, as the case may be, and (assuming each of the Transaction Documents constitutes the

registration statement as contemplated therein as soon as reasonably practicable, and in taking
such actions, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be
declared effective so that the Holders may receive proceeds from sales of Common Units prior to the
next estimated tax payment date after the disposition that results in recognition of such
accelerated built-in gain, provided that if such disposition is within 15&nbsp;days of such tax payment
date, then the next estimated tax payment date; (iii)&nbsp;waive any restrictions contained in the
Lock-up Agreements with respect to the sale of such Required Units or Common Units; and (iv)&nbsp;to the
extent rates other than long-term federal capital gains rates apply to the accelerated built-in
gain allocable to the Partners as a result of such disposition, promptly indemnify the Partners for
an amount equal to the product of (x)&nbsp;the amount of such accelerated built-in gain treated as other
than long-term capital gain because such assets had a holding period of one year or less at the
time of disposition, times (y)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of the sum of (1)&nbsp;the highest marginal federal
income tax rate applicable to individuals plus (2)&nbsp;67% of the highest marginal state and city
income tax rate applicable to individuals in the city of New York, over the sum of (3)&nbsp;the maximum
federal income tax rate for net capital gains of an individual for the year such built-in gain is
recognized plus (4)&nbsp;67% of the maximum New York state and city income tax rate for net capital
gains of an individual for the year such built-in gain is recognized. Notwithstanding any of the
other provisions in this <U>Section&nbsp;5.17</U>, in no event shall the provisions of this <U>Section
5.17</U> apply to any of the Class&nbsp;D Common Units (or Common Units) constituting part of the Escrow
Fund. For purposes of this <U>Section&nbsp;5.17</U>, the term &#147;<B>Required Units</B>&#148; means that number of
Class&nbsp;D Common Units as is reasonably expected to be required to be converted into Common Units so
that a holder thereof may, upon a prompt sale of such Common Units, realize sufficient net proceeds
therefrom, on an after-tax basis, in an amount equal to the federal income tax resulting from the
recognition of such built-in gain as a result of any actions by Regency or its Affiliates described
in clause (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;of the first sentence of this <U>Section&nbsp;5.17</U>. Regency shall provide
the Partners with prompt notice of each sale of interests in the Surviving Company or assets of the
Surviving Company that is reasonably likely to accelerate any built-in gain in any such asset of the Surviving Company with respect to the Class&nbsp;D Common Units
received by the Partners in the Merger, and such notice shall describe such sale in reasonable
detail, but in no event shall the failure to provide such prompt notice be construed to affect any
rights of Regency under this Agreement.

shall be entitled to use &#147;CDM&#148; in its name and in its business (including, in the case of the
Surviving Company, &#147;CDM Resource Management&#148;), and each such company may continue to use its logo

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">has been deposited under the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement,
claims by CDM under the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement as contemplated hereby shall be the sole
remedy by CDM and the Partners against Regency and Merger Sub for all breaches under this
Agreement, subject to the last sentence of this <U>Section&nbsp;6.4</U>. The Parties agree to take
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such escrow agreement to be entered into by the Escrow
Agent and the Parties as soon as practicable and, in any event, on or prior to the date that is 10
Business Days after the date of this Agreement. Upon such termination of this Agreement by CDM
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U>, CDM shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to
CDM such escrowed Breakage Fee, upon the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement (a &#147;<B>Partner Claim
Notice</B>&#148;), stating with particularity the nature of its claim for the Breakage Fee and the factual
basis for which CDM is entitled to the Breakage Fee under this Agreement. Regency may within seven
Business Days after receiving a Partner Claim Notice give notice to CDM and the Escrow Agent of any
objection thereto (the &#147;<B>Regency Objection Notice</B>&#148;). If Regency fails to deliver timely a Regency
Objection Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute to CDM the escrowed Breakage Fee, along
with the earned interest thereon, all in accordance with the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement. If
Regency timely delivers a Regency Objection Notice, then Regency and CDM shall promptly, and in any
event within 10&nbsp;days after delivery of the Regency Objection Notice, meet to attempt to resolve any
disputes with respect thereto. Any unresolved disputes shall be resolved in the manner referred to
in the Escrow Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than in accordance
with <U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U> or if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U> but CDM
fails to make a Partner Claim Notice within five Business Days after such termination or the
Partners and Regency agree that a breach by Regency or Merger Sub was not the sole reason Closing
did not occur on or before January&nbsp;31, 2008, then the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Regency the
escrowed Breakage Fee, along with the earned interest thereon. Regency, on the one hand, and the
Partners, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for 50% of the fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent. Payment of the Breakage Fee to CDM is intended as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, which the Parties
agree to be a reasonable amount for liquidated damages under this Agreement, given that it would be
impractical and extremely difficult to determine actual damages under such circumstances. If the
Breakage Fee is due and payable in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;6.4</U> and CDM receives the
Breakage Fee by either (x)&nbsp;delivery thereof from the Escrow Agent under the Breakage Fee Escrow
Agreement or (y)&nbsp;a direct payment from CDM, then the Breakage Fee shall eliminate any other remedy
available to CDM and the Partners against Regency and Merger Sub for all breaches under this
Agreement by Regency and Merger Sub. Upon any such payment of the Breakage Fee by Regency to CDM,
CDM and Regency shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Regency all amounts held by the
Escrow Agent under the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement. If the Breakage Fee is distributed by the
Escrow Agent to Regency pursuant to the terms of the Breakage Fee Escrow Agreement, CDM and the
Partners shall have all rights and remedies against Regency and Merger Sub for any liability for
any material breach by Regency or Merger Sub as contemplated by <U>Section&nbsp;7.5;</U> <I>provided,
however, </I>that in the event the Breakage Fee is so distributed by Escrow Agent to Regency solely
because CDM fails to timely deliver a Partner Claim Notice, then Regency and Merger Sub, together,
shall not be liable under this Agreement for an aggregate dollar amount in excess of the dollar
amount of the Breakage Fee.
