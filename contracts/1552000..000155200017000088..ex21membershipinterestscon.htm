Section 4.6 Additional Matters. The representations, warranties and covenants
of an Indemnifying Party, and an Indemnified Party's right to indemnification

is not reached within ten (10) business days after such Condemnation, by an
independent qualified firm reasonably acceptable to MPCI and MPLX, the amount
so determined by mutual agreement or by such independent firm, as applicable,
the "Condemnation Value") is greater than $41MM, MPCI may elect to:

(i) reduce the amount of the Total Value by such Condemnation Value; or

(ii) restore or replace the Refining Logistics Assets relating to such
Condemnation to a condition reasonably comparable to their Prior Condition, in
each case by notice to MPLX.



(b) If MPCI elects to reduce the Total Value pursuant to Section 11.9(a)

Commercially Reasonable Efforts to collect amounts due (if any)under any
applicable condemnation award in respect of any such Condemnation and shall
cause any such condemnation award to be contributed or assigned to the
applicable Refining Logistics Entity that has suffered such Condemnation
(provided that if the Total Value is reduced due to such Condemnation, and
such Total Value reduction does not take into account such condemnation award,
then any condemnation award that is received by the Refining Logistics
Entities following the Closing shall promptly be remitted to MPCI).

(f) To assist MPLX in its evaluation of any and all Condemnation (including
Condemnation Value), MPCI shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide
MPLX such access to the Refining Logistics Assets that are the subject of a
Condemnation and such information as MPLX may reasonably request in connection
therewith.

Section 11.10 Waiver of Distributions on Common Units, GP Units and Incentive
Distribution Rights. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
quarterly distribution to be paid on the Common Units and GP Units to be
issued by MPLX in connection with the Closing and comprising the Logistics

COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING A FINANCING SOURCE OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF.

Section 15.6 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance of
this Agreement in all respects. If the date specified herein for giving any
notice or taking any action is not a business day (or if the period during

is not a business day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such
action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required
to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a business day.

Section 15.7 Waiver and Severability.

(a) No waiver, either express or implied, by any Party hereto of any term or
condition of this Agreement or right to enforcement thereof shall be
effective, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by all Parties. Any
such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter
described in such writing and shall in no way adversely affect the rights of
the Parties granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time.
The failure of any Party to exercise any rights or privileges under this
Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any such rights or privileges
under this Agreement. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are
cumulative and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, none
is exclusive of any other or of any rights or remedies that any Party may
hereunder or otherwise have at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 15.7(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, there
shall be no waiver to this sentence, the last sentence of Section 15.2(b) or
any of Sections 15.3 or 15.5(d) (or any provision of this Agreement to the
extent a waiver of such provision would modify the substance of this sentence,
the last sentence of Section 15.2(b) or any of Sections 15.3 or 15.5(d)) in a
manner that would be adverse to any Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Financing Source (and any such waiver without such prior
written consent shall be null and void).



(b) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained
herein.

Section 15.8 Costs and Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, each Party will bear its own costs and expenses in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
