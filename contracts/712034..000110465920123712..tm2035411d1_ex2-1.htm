and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and accept (or shall cause to
be purchased and accepted) from Seller, the Company Units, free and clear of

(b)  On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause it Subsidiaries, as

(c)  The Direct Transfers of the Directly Transferred Assets
shall be effected pursuant to a transfer agreement, bill of sale,
endorsement, assignment, certificate, deed or other instrument of conveyance
and assignment, in each case, in a customary form to be mutually agreed by

Assets and not have any effect on the value being given or received by Buyer,
Seller and their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, or the terms and
conditions of the Transactions.

  



  

(d)  Seller and Buyer Parent will, upon the Closing, (a) execute

Assignment in substantially the form as attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ with
respect to all Internet domain names and Copyrights constituting Directly
Transferred Assets (the " _Copyright and Internet Domain Name Assignment_ ").
Buyer shall, with the cooperation of Seller, (i) file the Patent Assignment
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and (ii) file the Trademark
Assignment with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Upon request from
Buyer, Seller agrees to, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to,
execute local assignments and take such other actions with respect to the
Patents, Trademarks (including the domain names) and Copyrights included in
the Directly Transferred Assets as may be necessary or advisable under
applicable Law outside the United States to effectuate or perfect the
assignment of such Patents, Trademarks (including the domain names) and
Copyrights to Buyer (or any designated Subsidiary of Buyer Parent), all such
assignments and other documentation to be duly executed, delivered,
notarized and apostilled as reasonably necessary at Seller's expense, and to

Purchase Price, together with the additional amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ , is referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_."

is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

reasonable detail (i) good faith estimates of Net Working Capital,
Transaction Expenses, Cash and Indebtedness of the Company as of 12:01 a.m.,
New York City time, on the Closing Date, and the calculations thereof, and
(ii) the Closing NWC Adjustment (the " _Projected Statement_ "). The
Projected Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall consider in good faith any
comments to the Projected Statement that may be proposed by Buyer and each of
Seller and Buyer in good faith shall seek to resolve any differences that
they may have with respect thereto; provided, that if the parties are unable
to resolve such differences prior to the Closing, the estimates of Net
Working Capital, Transaction Expenses, Cash and Indebtedness, as
applicable, and the resulting Closing NWC Adjustment, as reflected in the
Projected Statement shall be used for purposes of calculating the Initial
Purchase Price on the Closing Date.

  



  

(b)   _Post -Closing Adjustment Procedures_.

  



  

(i)  Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver
to Seller, no later than seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, a
written statement setting forth in reasonable detail its calculations of (A)
Net Working Capital, Transaction Expenses, Cash and Indebtedness of the
Company as of 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date and (B) the
Final NWC Adjustment (the " _Preliminary Statement_ "). The Preliminary
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and,
for the avoidance of doubt, no changes shall be made in any reserve or absence
thereof existing as of the Closing Date except (1) as a result of events
occurring after the Closing Date or (2) in the event such reserve or
absence thereof was not established or omitted in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and, in any such event, only in accordance with the
Accounting Principles.

  



  

   

-22-

 



    



  

(ii)   During the thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Preliminary Statement, Seller and its authorized Representatives shall have
reasonable access during normal business hours to the facilities, books and
records, personnel and accountants of the Company (subject to the execution
of customary access letters) for the purpose of assessing the Preliminary
Statement. Within such thirty (30) days, Seller may object to all or any part
of the Preliminary Statement by delivering to Buyer a written notice (an "
_Objections Statement_ ") setting forth support for Seller's position in
reasonable detail. If Seller delivers an Objections Statement to Buyer, then
Buyer and Seller shall use their respective good faith efforts to resolve the
disputed items.

  



  

(iii)  If Seller and Buyer fail to resolve all disputes raised
by the Objections Statement within thirty (30) days after delivery to Buyer
thereof, then either Seller or Buyer may submit the unresolved matters in
dispute to Deloitte and Touche LLP (or, if such accounting firm is unwilling or
unable to serve in such capacity, a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm selected by Seller out of a list of three (3) other
accounting firms of recognized national standing proposed by Buyer) (such
firm, the " _Accountant_ "), and such Accountant shall consider only those
items or amounts disputed by Seller in the Objections Statement which remain
open. Seller and Buyer shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the
Accountant for its engagement hereunder. The Accountant shall make a final,
binding and non-appealable determination of the Net Working
Capital, Transaction Expenses, Cash and Indebtedness of the Company as of
12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date (solely to the extent
such amounts set forth in the Objections Statement remain in dispute) and
deliver to Buyer and Seller a revised written statement, prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles (no changes shall be made in any
reserve or absence thereof existing as of the Closing Date except (1) as a
result of events occurring after the Closing Date or (2) in the event such
reserve or absence thereof was not established or omitted in accordance with
the Accounting Principles and, in any such event, only in accordance with the
Accounting Principles), reflecting such determination. The fees and expenses
of the Accountant shall be allocated to Seller and Buyer based upon the
percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to such Party
bears to the amount contested (e.g., if Seller submits an Objections
Statement for $1,000, Buyer contests $500 of such amount, and the Accountant
resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300, then the costs and expenses of
the Accountant shall be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e.,
200/500) to Seller).

  



  

(iv)  The " _Final Statement_ " shall be (A) the Preliminary
Statement, in the event Seller notifies Buyer in writing of its acceptance of
the Preliminary Statement or fails to timely submit an Objections Statement,
(B) the written statement reflecting the mutual agreement of Seller and
Buyer, in the event Seller and Buyer mutually agree to a resolution of all
disputes raised in an Objections Statement or (C) the written statement
prepared by the Accountant. The Final Statement shall be binding, final and
non-appealable for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

   

-23-

 



    



  

(c)   _Payment of Post -Closing Adjustment_. Within five (5)
Business Days following the final determination of the Final Statement as set
forth in _Section 2.5(b)_ :

  



  

(i)  if the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, Seller
shall pay to Buyer an amount in immediately available funds equal to the
Post-Closing Adjustment;

  



  

(ii)  if the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, Buyer
shall pay to Seller an amount in immediately available funds equal to the
Post-Closing Adjustment; and

  



  

(iii)  if the Post-Closing Adjustment is zero, neither Party shall
have any obligation to pay an additional amount pursuant to this _Section
2.5(c)_.

  



  

2.6   _Earn-Out Consideration_.

  



  

(a)  As additional consideration for the Company Units, Buyer
shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller, in accordance with this _Section
2.6_ :

  



  

(i)  an amount (the " _First Earn -Out Payment_") equal to the
sum of (A) the First Earn-Out Net Revenue Payment (if any) plus (B) the First
Earn-Out Contribution Payment (if any); and

  



  

(ii)  an amount (the " _Second Earn -Out Payment_") equal to the
sum of (A) the Second Earn-Out Net Revenue Payment (if any) plus (B) the
Second Earn-Out Contribution Payment (if any).

  



  

(b)  Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and deliver
to Seller, no later than sixty (60) days after each of the First Earn-Out
Period and the Second Earn-Out Period, a written statement setting forth in
reasonable detail its calculation of the First Earn-Out Payment or the Second
Earn-Out Payment, as applicable (the " _Earn -Out Statement_"). During the
thirty (30) days following delivery of the Earn-Out Statement, Seller and its
Representatives shall have reasonable access during normal business hours to
the facilities, books and records, personnel and accountants of the Company
for the purpose of assessing the Earn-Out Statement. Within such thirty (30)
days, Seller may object to all or any part of the Earn-Out Statement by
delivering to Buyer a written notice setting forth support for their position
in reasonable detail (an " _Earn -Out Objection_"). If Seller agrees in
writing to the Earn-Out Statement or fails to timely deliver an Earn-Out
Objection, then the First Earn-Out Payment or the Second Earn-Out Payment, as
applicable, shall be as set forth in the Earn-Out Statement. If Seller timely
delivers an Earn-Out Objection, then Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective good faith efforts to resolve the disputed items set forth
therein. If Seller and Buyer fail to resolve all disputes raised by the Earn-
Out Objection within thirty (30) days after delivery to Buyer thereof, then
either Seller or Buyer may submit the unresolved matters in dispute to the
Accountant, and Seller and Buyer shall execute any agreement reasonably
required by the Accountant for its engagement hereunder. The Accountant shall
make a final, binding and non-appealable determination of the First Earn-Out
Payment or the Second Earn-Out Payment, as applicable (solely to the extent
the components thereof set forth in the Earn-Out Objection remain in
dispute), and deliver to Buyer and Seller a revised written reflecting such
determination. The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be allocated to
Seller and based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to such party bears to the amount contested (e.g., if Seller
submits an Earn-Out Objection for $1,000, Buyer contests $500 of such
amount, and the Accountant resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300, then
the costs and expenses of the Accountant shall be allocated 60% (i.e.,
300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to Seller).

  



  

   

-24-

 



    



  

(c)  If the amount of First Earn-Out Payment or the Second Earn-
Out Payment, as applicable (as finally determined in accordance with _Section
2.6(b)_), is a positive amount, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, promptly after
determination thereof, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller, an amount equal to the First Earn-Out Payment
or the Second Earn-Out Payment, as applicable.

  



  

(d)  From the Closing Date until the termination of the Second
Earn-Out Period, the Business shall be operated exclusively by Buyer Parent
and its Subsidiaries and Buyer Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain separate books and records with respect to the
Business and (ii) cooperate with Mr. Bensussen to develop reasonable and
customary internal management reports with respect to the Business to
facilitate assessment of Net Revenue and Direct Contribution for the
Business on at least a quarterly basis (it being acknowledged and agreed that
the formal determination of Net Revenue and Direct Contribution is only
expected on an annual basis in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_. In the event
Buyer Parent or any of its Subsidiaries takes any action (or fails to take
any action required by this Agreement) other than in good faith and in the
ordinary course, which action (or inaction) increases the expenses incurred
by the Business or allocates additional expenses to the Business, in each
case, not presently contemplated in the budget of the Business, then the
impact of such expenses or allocations shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining the Direct Contribution during all periods in which they are so
incurred or allocated. Seller acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the
foregoing and _Section 2.6(e)_, there is no assurance that Seller will
receive any Earn-Out Consideration and the Buyer has not promised that any
Earn-Out Consideration will be paid.

  



  

(e)  Until the earlier of the end of the Second Earn-Out Period
and the termination of Mr. Bensussen\'s employment with Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, (i) Mr. Bensussen shall be the Senior Vice President of the
Business, (ii) the Continuing Employees and other employees hired to
primarily support the operating activities of the Business (collectively, "
_Post-Closing Continuing Employees_ ") shall report directly or indirectly to
Mr. Bensussen, (iii) Mr. Bensussen shall be granted a budget for direct
operating expenditures of $25,110,000 for the First Earn Out Period and
$27,460,000 for the Second Earn Out Period, in each case, as specified in the
Earn Out Calculation Principles and (iv) Mr. Bensussen will have the
authority consistent with prior practice to manage, conduct and operate the
business affairs of the Business, subject to (A) the applicable operating
expenditures budget (as established pursuant to this _Section 2.6(e)_ ), (B)
Mr. Bensussen's reporting relationship to the Executive Vice President, ACCO
Brands North America and (C) the generally applicable policies of Buyer and
Buyer Parent, including Buyer Parent's code of conduct and policies with
respect to Buyer Parent's financial reporting and legal compliance. Except as
otherwise approved by Mr. Bensussen (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Post-Closing Continuing Employees shall
devote their full business time to the Business during the First Earn-Out
Period and Second Earn-Out Period, it being acknowledged and agreed that such
employees shall be required to comply with applicable Law and Buyer Parent's
internal financial controls and reporting, compliance and other general
policies and practices in connection with the Business.

(f)  Buyer, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
hereby waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment or similar
rights that Buyer or its Affiliates may have with respect to any Earn-Out
Consideration.

  



  

(g)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
if (i) Buyer Parent sells or otherwise transfers to any Person (other than
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer Parent), directly or
indirectly, a material portion of the properties and assets of the Business,
whether by way of merger, consolidation, business combination, asset sale or
otherwise, including through a sale of equity interests in any entity that
directly or indirectly holds any properties or assets of the Business, or a
combination of any of the foregoing (such transactions, collectively, a "
_Sale of the Business_ "), then the Earn-Out Consideration shall be
immediately due and payable in full at or immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction, or (ii) Buyer terminates the employment of
Mr. Bensussen without Cause or Mr. Bensussen's employment is terminated for
Good Reason on or prior to the end of the Second Earn-Out Period, then the
Earn-Out Consideration shall be immediately due and payable upon such
termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of following shall constitute
a Sale of the Business for purposes of this Agreement: (A) the sale or other
transfer of voting equity of Buyer Parent, directly or indirectly, by way of
merger, consolidation, business combination or otherwise (including any such
sale or other transfer that results in a sale of control of Buyer
Parent), (B) the sale or other transfer, directly or indirectly, of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of Buyer Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company), taken as a whole, or (C) internal
reorganizations, restructuring or other transactions between or among Buyer
Parent and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Business or the Company;
_provided that_ , in each case, the Business continues to be operated
exclusively by Buyer Parent (or its successor) and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(h)  Each of Seller, the Principals and their respective
Representatives shall be required, as a condition to access to and receipt of
any information related to the Business pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ , to
execute and deliver to Buyer Parent a customary confidentiality agreement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer Parent. The Parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that the Earn-Out Consideration shall be treated
as an installment obligation for purposes of Section 453 of the Code, and no
party shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with such
characterization unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Any Earn-Out
Consideration paid to Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for U.S. federal and applicable state
and local income Tax purposes (to the extent not treated as imputed interest
pursuant to Section 483 of the Code), except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

Agreement, Buyer and any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such amounts
that Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under any applicable Law. Other
than withholding on amounts treated as compensation for Tax purposes, at least
thirty (30) days prior to withholding any amount pursuant to this _Section
2.7_ , the applicable withholding agent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide written notice to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid, together with reasonably sufficient details
regarding the nature of the relevant withholding Tax. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Buyer, Buyer shall remit such withheld or deducted
amounts to the applicable Governmental Entity and such withheld or deducted
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding or
deduction was made.

of Washington and (B) is qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets or

the Company Units and has good title to the Company Units, free and clear of
all Liens. The Company Units have been duly authorized and are validly issued,
were not issued in violation of any Law or preemptive rights and constitute
the only issued and outstanding Equity Interests of the Company. Upon

(i)  the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local
or foreign court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of
any applicable antitrust or competition Laws (" _Government Antitrust Entity_
") of non-privileged information and documents requested by any Government
Antitrust Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit

the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
Order is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or
issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful
or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Transactions, any and all reasonable steps (including the
appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated
by _Section 5.2(b)(ii)_ ) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse,

Buyer's officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Closing, to
the Business Employees, Contracts and the properties, books and records
Related to the Business and, during such period, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Buyer all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel Related to the Business as may reasonably
be requested; _provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to this _Section
5.3_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by Seller herein. The foregoing shall not require Seller (a) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
Seller would result in (i) the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or (ii) the violation of or the creation of any liability under any
Law by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) to disclose any privileged
information of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in accordance with such trade secret or Law and in a manner that does
not result in the waiver of any such privilege, Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to make reasonable
and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which these restrictions apply. Nothing in this _Section 5.3 _shall limit,
expand or otherwise modify in any respect any rights any Person may have with

to any then existing actual or potential Action between the Parties. All
requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall be
directed to Jared Collinge ([***]) and Andrea Haley ([***]) or any other
Person designated in writing to Buyer by Seller. All information received or
accessed by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement prior to the Closing.

  



  

5.4   _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a)  Effective as of the end of the Employee Transition Period
(as defined in the Transition Services Agreement), Seller or its Subsidiaries
will terminate all Business Employees in North America or the United Kingdom
who are then employed with the Seller or its Subsidiaries. No later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall present an offer of
employment to each such Business Employee, which offer shall be effective as
of the first Business Day following the end of the Employee Transition Period
(as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) subject to such Business
Employee's continued employment with Seller or its Subsidiaries as of the end
of the Employee Transition Period (as defined in the Transition Services
Agreement). Each such job offer shall comply with the requirements of
_Section 5.4(d)_ and _Section 5.4(e)_ to the extent applicable and
provide for the following terms of employment: (a) a position with job duties
substantially comparable to those applicable to the employee's position
immediately prior to the Closing; (b) a primary work location within 20 miles
of such employee's assigned primary work location immediately prior to the
Closing and (c) such other terms as are required to comply with applicable
Law. Prior to providing such offers, Buyer shall provide Seller, for the
Seller's review and comment, each template offer of employment to be used for
purposes of such offers and a schedule setting forth the compensation being
offered to each Business Employee.

  



  

   

-51-

 



    



  

(b) Seller or its Subsidiaries will continue to engage any
Business Employees not subject to Section 5.4(a) through the end of the
Term of the Transition Services Agreement, or such earlier time as Buyer and
Seller shall mutually agree. Buyer and Seller shall work together during such
time to further understand the nature of the employment or other contractual
relationship of these Business Employees and determine the best way to
transfer these relationships to the Buyer or Buyer's Subsidiaries with the
least cost or disruption to Buyer and Seller. In either case, any resulting
employment with Buyer will be for (a) a position with duties substantially
comparable to those applicable to the individual's position immediately prior
to the Closing; (b) a primary work location within twenty (20) miles of such
employee's assigned primary work location immediately prior to the Closing
and (c) such other terms as are required to comply with applicable Law. Any
resulting contractual arrangement with Buyer will be on terms and conditions
no less favorable to the contractor as the existing independent contractor
arrangement with Seller to the extent permissible under applicable Law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Buyer to assume any
Contracts with independent contractors subject to this _Section
5.4(b)_; provided that, if not assumed, Buyer shall enter into either a new
Contract or other arrangement for the provision of such services with such
Business Employee in accordance with this _Section 5.4(b) _effective no later
than the end of the term of the Transition Services Agreement. Seller shall,
or shall cause, that certain Independent Service Contract for Independent
Contractor, dated as of August 1, 2019, by and between Seller and
Accesstories, to be terminated upon the end of the term of the Transition
Services Agreement or, earlier, upon Buyer's prior written request; provided
that Buyer shall enter into either a new Contract or other arrangement for the
provision of such services in accordance with this _Section
5.4(b)_ effective no later than the end of the term of the Transition
Services Agreement.

  



  

(c) Seller or its Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for
and shall pay, and Buyer shall have no responsibility or liability for all
accrued compensation, vacation pay, severance pay, and other payments due to
Business Employees on account of their employment or other relationship with
the Seller or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing and shall be
responsible for any employment or other work-related liability that relates
to periods before the Closing Date. Seller or its Subsidiaries shall be
solely responsible for and shall pay, and Buyer shall have no responsibility
or liability for any accrued but unused vacation pay, severance pay, or other
payments due to Business Employees solely as a result of the Seller's
termination of any Business Employee during the Employee Transition Period
(as defined in the Transition Services Agreement). Seller shall, or shall
cause a Subsidiary (other than the Company) to, pay, subject to all required
tax withholdings, the account balance of each Business Employee under the
Seller (formerly Bensussen Deutsch and Associates, Inc.) Deferred Compensation
Plan on or within forty-five (45) days following the Closing. Buyer shall
have no responsibility or liability for any such payments arising from
Business Employees' employment or other relationship with the Seller or its
Subsidiaries. Buyer shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary, to pay, subject to all
required tax withholdings (i) annual bonuses in respect of 2020 to Business
Employees, to the extent earned as determined by Seller on or prior to
February 28, 2021, which shall be paid no later than March 15, 2021 and (ii)
the Long-Term Bonuses to Business Employees, to the extent earned as
determined by Seller on or prior to February 28, 2021, which shall be paid
no later than March 15, 2021, which amounts in each case shall constitute
Transaction Expenses. Seller covenants that all outstanding options under any
stock option plan maintained by Seller held by any Business Employee, whether
or not fully vested, will be cancelled and terminated by virtue of the
termination of employment of the Business Employee as contemplated by Section
5.4(a). Seller agrees to satisfy, or cause its insurance carriers, third
party administrators or other compensation or benefit providers to satisfy,
all claims for benefits brought by or in respect of Business Employees,
whether insured or otherwise (including, but not limited to, workers'
compensation, life insurance, medical, dental, vision and disability
programs), under any employee retirement, welfare, fringe or other benefit or
compensation programs (the " _Plans_ "), which claims arise out of events
occurring in connection with employment by Seller prior to the Closing Date,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Plans. Seller shall also
make all required contributions to the Plans on behalf of Business
Employees on account of their employment at or before the Closing Date with
the Seller. Seller shall vest all Business Employees in their retirement plan
benefits as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of
this Agreement, Seller shall be responsible and liable for providing, or
continuing to provide, health care continuation coverage as required under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (" _COBRA_ ") with
respect to any individual who experienced a COBRA "qualifying event" on or
prior to the Closing Date under any Benefit Plan subject to COBRA.

(d)  All Business Employees who are employed with the Seller or
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (as referenced in _Sections 5.4(a)_ or
_5.4(b)_ ) and who accept Buyer's or its Subsidiary's offer of
employment prior to the end of the Employee Transition Period (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement) (collectively, " _Continuing Employees_ ")
will become employees of Buyer or such Subsidiary. Buyer agrees that each
Continuing Employee working in the United States shall, during the period
commencing at the end of the Employee Transition Period (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) and ending on the second (2nd) anniversary of
the Closing, be provided with (i) base salary or base wage that is no less
favorable than the base salary or base wage rate established for such
Continuing Employee for 2021, reserving its right to reclassify such
Continuing Employee to exempt or non-exempt and adjusting the method of
compensation as needed, (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are
no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus opportunities provided by
Seller to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and
(iii) welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided by Seller and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(e) Buyer shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans
of Buyer or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee
credit for the plan year in which the Closing occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred
prior to the Closing for which payment has been made and (iii) give
each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee's
employment with Seller and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting and
eligibility to participate under each applicable Buyer benefit plan, as if
such service had been performed with Buyer, except with respect to
eligibility under any defined benefit pension plans, nonqualified deferred
compensation and equity or equity-based benefit plans maintained by Buyer or
its Affiliates or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits,
coverage or compensation.

  



  

   

-53-

 



    



  

(f)  Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Seller,
Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any
of their benefit plans, (iii) prevent Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates, after the Closing, from terminating the employment of any
Continuing Employee, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Business Employee, any beneficiary or dependent thereof with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates may maintain.

  



  

5.5   _Publicity_. Prior to the Closing, no Party shall (a) issue
any press release or public announcement related to this Agreement or the
Transactions or (b) make any other announcement or communication to the
employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or other business relations of
Seller or its Subsidiaries, in each case, without the joint approval of Buyer
and Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall be permitted to make announcements to their respective employees,
customers and other business relations to the extent determined in good faith
by Seller to be necessary or advisable so long as such announcements are
consistent with prior announcements approved by Buyer (including announcements
approved by Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement); and (ii) no consent
shall be necessary to the extent a disclosure (A) is consistent with prior
announcements approved by the other Parties (including announcements approved
by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement), and
(B) is determined in good faith to be required by applicable Law or stock
exchange rules or regulations.

  



  

5.6   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to _Section 5.6(e)_ , Buyer and Seller shall each
bear half (50%) of all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, recording,
value added, registration and other similar Taxes and all conveyance fees,
recording fees and other similar charges (all including penalties, interest
and other charges with respect thereto) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with the Transactions, except that (i) Seller shall bear all
Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Contribution and (ii) Buyer
shall bear all Transfer Taxes, and, notwithstanding _Section 2.7_ , shall bear
all withholding Taxes (by not withholding from the relevant payment to
Seller) incurred or arising in connection with the Transactions to the extent
greater than those that would have been incurred or arisen (or that would not
have been incurred or arisen at all) had the Directly Transferred Assets been
contributed to the Company in the Contribution and indirectly acquired by
Buyer as a result of the transfer of the Company Units.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that the purchase and sale of the Company
Units will be treated for U.S. federal and applicable state and local Tax
purposes as a taxable sale and purchase of all of the ownership interests of
an entity that is disregarded as separate from Seller and, therefore, as a
taxable sale and purchase of certain assets of Seller and shall make all
reports and file all Tax Returns consistent with such treatment. For the
avoidance of doubt, in accordance with such Tax treatment, all deductions
relating to expenses paid (or treated as paid) and accrued by the Company
prior to the Closing will be deducted by Seller on its Tax Returns to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

   

-54-

 



    



  

(c)

  



  

(i)  A portion of the Final Purchase Price (as determined and
allocated to Buyer under clause (A) below and taking into account any assumed
liabilities and all other items treated as purchase price for applicable Tax
purposes and required to be allocated pursuant to the Code, even if not
included in the Final Purchase Price, such items together with the Final
Purchase Price, the " _Tax Consideration_ ") shall be allocated among the
assets treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having been transferred
from Seller to Buyer in the Closing (the " _Company Assets_ ") in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder as set forth in this _Section 5.6(c)_.
Buyer shall prepare an initial allocation according to the methodology set
forth in Schedule 5.6(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. In connection with
such preparation, Seller shall be entitled to review a draft of Buyer's third
party appraisal, Buyer shall consider in good faith any written comments
received from Seller, and Buyer shall communicate comments that it deems
appropriate to the appraiser prior to the issuance of any final report or
valuation. Buyer shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days following the
Closing (or thirty (30) days following the determination of the Final
Statement in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_, if later), prepare a schedule
(A) first, allocating the Tax Consideration among Buyer and its designees
under _Section 2.1(b)_ in respect of the Company Units purchased by Buyer and
the applicable Directly Transferred Assets purchased by such designee of
Buyer in a manner consistent with the values of the Company Units and the
Directly Transferred Assets and (B) second, allocating the Tax Consideration
so allocated to Buyer among the Company Assets consistent with such
methodology (such schedule, the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") and provide the
Allocation Schedule to Seller.

  



  

(ii)  Seller shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Allocation Schedule to notify Buyer in writing whether Seller accepts or
rejects the Allocation Schedule. If Seller rejects the Allocation Schedule or
fails to timely notify Buyer that it accepts the Allocation Schedule, then
neither party shall have any obligations under this _Section 5.6(c)_. If
Seller timely accepts the Allocation Schedule, except as required by a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, Seller,
Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall (A) prepare and file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule
(including IRS Form 8594), (B) not take any position inconsistent with the
Allocation Schedule, and (C) not agree to any proposed adjustment to the
Allocation Schedule by any taxing authority without, to the extent
practicable, first giving the other Parties prior written notice and
consulting with the other Parties in good faith with respect to such
proposed adjustment. If the Final Purchase Price (or Tax Consideration) is
subsequently adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_,  _Section 2.6(h)_ ,
_Section 8.6_ or any other provision of this Agreement, the Allocation
Schedule shall be further adjusted in the manner consistent with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 5.6(c)_ and the methodology described in
Schedule 5.6(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

  



  



  

(d)  For purposes of determining Seller Taxes, in the case of
any Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion
of such Taxes allocated to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any property, ad valorem
or franchise Taxes (except franchise Taxes based upon, measured by or related
to income or receipts), be deemed to be an amount of such Taxes for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period, and (ii)
in the case of any other Taxes, be deemed to equal the amount which would be
payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing Date.

  



     

   

-55-

 



    



  

(e)   All sums payable by Buyer (or any designated Subsidiary of
Buyer Parent) to Seller (or its Subsidiaries) pursuant to this Agreement as
consideration for any of the Directly Transferred Assets are, unless
expressly stated otherwise, payable exclusive of any applicable VAT which is
properly chargeable thereon. If VAT is properly chargeable on any such sums
payable by Buyer (or any designated Subsidiary of Buyer Parent) pursuant to
this Agreement and Seller (or any of its Subsidiaries) is required to account
to the relevant taxing authority for such VAT, Buyer (or any designated
Subsidiary of Buyer Parent) shall, subject to, and upon, receipt of a valid
VAT invoice from the Seller (or any of its relevant Subsidiaries), pay to
Seller in addition an amount equal to the amount of the VAT. If any VAT is
properly chargeable on any portion of the Final Purchase Price to be paid by
Buyer (or any designated Subsidiary of Buyer Parent) pursuant to this
Agreement, Seller shall deliver to the applicable designated Subsidiary of
Buyer Parent accepting the relevant Directly Transferred Assets upon which VAT
is chargeable a valid VAT invoice at the Closing (or as soon as practicable
thereafter).

  



  

5.7   _Contribution_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall effect
the Contribution in accordance with, and pursuant to the terms and conditions
of, the Contribution and Assumption Agreement. All agreements, documents and
other instruments used to effect the Contribution shall be reasonably
acceptable to Buyer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
(a) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to make
any representations, warranties, covenants or indemnities therein (other than
those in included in _Exhibit A_) and (b) Seller and Buyer hereby agree that
the assets and liabilities of the Business transferred, and excluded from
transfer, to the Company in the Contribution shall be as set forth in the
Contribution and Assumption Agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit A_
hereto (it being acknowledged and agreed that Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
to finalize the detailed annexes and schedules to the Contribution and
Assumption Agreement prior to the Closing, which such detailed annexes and
schedules shall be reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer).

  



  

5.8   _Transition Planning; Transition Services Agreement_.

  



  

(a)  From the date hereof until the Closing, each Party shall,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with respect to the planning of
the separation and orderly transition of the Business to Buyer from Seller,
including, without limitation, with respect to personnel, information
technology assets and systems.

  



  

(b)  At the Closing, the Parties will execute the Transition
Services Agreement, in the form previously agreed, to facilitate the orderly
transfer, use and operation of the Business for a transitional period
following the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth therein, subject
to changes prior to the Closing as may be mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer.

  



  

5.9   _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing,
each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly execute,
acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents or instruments
of transfer reasonably requested by the other Party and necessary for the
other Party to satisfy its obligations hereunder or to obtain the benefits of
the Transactions.

  



  

   

-56-

 



    



     

5.10   _No Solicitation of Competing Proposals_. During the period
from the date of this Agreement through the earlier to occur of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of
any proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer and its
Representatives) relating to the acquisition of a material portion of the
equity interests or assets of the Company or the Business (including any
acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation or share exchange) or (b)
enter into, maintain or continue discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish or disclose to any Person any information in connection with any
acquisition of a material portion of the equity interests or assets of the
Company or the Business (including any acquisition structured as a merger,
consolidation or share exchange), and neither Seller nor the Company shall
enter into any letter of intent or purchase agreement, merger agreement or
other similar agreement with any Person other than Buyer with respect to the
acquisition of a material portion of the equity interests or assets of the
Company or the Business (including any acquisition structured as a merger,
consolidation or share exchange).

  



  

5.11   _Confidentiality_. For a period of three (3) years from and
after the Closing Date, each of the Principals, Seller Parent and Seller

Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, disclose to any third party (other than among each other or

confidential or proprietary information related to the Business;
provided, that the foregoing restriction shall not (a) apply to any
information (i) that becomes generally available to, or known by, the public

(ii) is independently developed by Seller or any of its Affiliates after
Closing without reference to or use of the applicable confidential or
proprietary information, or (iii) that is disclosed by Mr. Bensussen in
connection with his continued employment with or other services provided to
Buyer Parent and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course and in accordance
with Buyer's code of conduct then in effect, or (b) prohibit any disclosure
(i) required by Law so long as, other than with respect to any Tax Return, to

enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement, any

violation of this _Section 5.11_.

(c) Any such access described in _Sections 5.13(a)_ and
_5.13(b)_ above shall be granted in a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the conduct of the business of the Party granting such access. The

restrictions apply. Nothing in this _Section 5.13_ shall limit, expand
or otherwise modify in any respect any rights any Party may have with respect

connection with any litigation and, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the
provisions of this _Section 5.13_ shall require a Party to give to the other

-59-

 



    



  

(d)  From and after the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to make available to each other, upon reasonable written request,
their (and their Affiliates') respective officers, directors, employees and
other Representatives for fact finding, consultation and interviews and as
witnesses to the extent that any such individual may reasonably be required
in connection with any Actions in which the requesting Party may from time to
time be involved relating to the conduct of the Business or the Retained
Businesses prior to or after the Closing (other than any dispute or Action
between Seller, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the
one hand, and Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on
the other hand). Access to such Persons shall be granted during normal
business hours at a location and in a manner reasonably calculated to

other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys' fees, but

5.14   _Non-Solicit; Non-Compete_.

  



  

(a)  In consideration of the substantial amounts to be paid to
Seller (and thereby indirectly to Seller Parent and each Principal) pursuant
to this Agreement and to protect the goodwill of the Business sold in
connection therewith, and as a condition to Buyer's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date,
each of Mr. Bensussen, Mr. Deutsch, Seller Parent and Seller covenants,
severally and not jointly, that it shall not or, with respect to Seller
Parent, not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly solicit
or hire, whether as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or
otherwise, any Business Employee; provided that the foregoing restriction
shall not apply to (i) generalized searches by use of advertising or
recruiting efforts (including the use of search firms) that are not
specifically targeted at such Business Employees or hiring any individual who
responds to any such general solicitation, or (ii) soliciting or hiring
any Business Employee who is no longer employed by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates and has not been so employed by Buyer or its Affiliates for at
least one hundred and eighty (180) days. For the avoidance of doubt, none of
the restrictions in this _Section 5.14(a)_ shall apply to Mr. Bensussen to
the extent of any solicitation or offer of employment extended on behalf of
Buyer or its Subsidiaries.

(b) In consideration of the substantial amounts to be paid to
Seller (and thereby indirectly to Seller Parent and each Principal) pursuant
to this Agreement and to protect the goodwill of the Business sold in
connection therewith, and as a condition to Buyer's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date,
each of Mr. Bensussen, Mr. Deutsch, Seller Parent and Seller covenants,
severally and not jointly, that it shall not or, with respect to Seller
Parent, permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, engage in
any Competitive Business (including (x) as a principal or for its or his own
account or solely or jointly with others (or as a shareholder in any
corporation or joint stock association) or (y) by holding any equity
interests in any Person that engages in any Competitive Business) anywhere in
the world; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict any
of Mr. Bensussen, Mr. Deutsch, Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from
acquiring or owning as an investment, directly or indirectly, publicly-traded
securities or any indebtedness of any company that is engaged in any
Competitive Business if such Person (i) does not, directly or indirectly,
beneficially own in the aggregate more than five (5) percent (5%) of such
securities outstanding or indebtedness of such company and (ii) acquires or
owns such securities or indebtedness for passive investment purposes only. "
_Competitive Business_ " means a business that (A) derives a non- _de minimis_
 portion of its revenues from an activity in which the Business is
principally engaged or (B) competes with the Business in any material
respect, in each case based on the operations of the Business as of the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, no activity of Mr. Bensussen
engaged in on behalf of Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise in connection
with his employment with Buyer or its Subsidiaries or services with respect
to the Business, shall be deemed to be in violation of this _Section
5.14(b)_.

  



  

(c)   _Section 5.14(b)_ shall not prevent or restrict in any way
the Principals, Seller Parent, Seller or any of Seller Parent's Subsidiaries
from engaging in, conducting or having an ownership interest in the Retained
Business as currently conducted.

  



  

(d)  Each Principal, Seller Parent and Seller acknowledges and
agrees that the covenants and agreements set forth in this  _Section 5.14_
and elsewhere in this Agreement were a material inducement to Buyer to enter
into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. Each of the
Principals, Seller Parent and Seller hereby acknowledges that the restrictive
covenants set forth in _Section 5.14_ and elsewhere in this Agreement are
reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area restrictions and are
necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business and to prevent the
impairment of the value of the substantial investment therein being made by
Buyer hereunder. Each of the Principals, Seller Parent, Seller and Buyer
agrees that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-
appealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a specified
geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant
element of this _Section 5.14_ or other restrictive covenant in this Agreement
is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant element
which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not
against public policy may be enforced against the applicable party. Each of
the Principals, Seller Parent and Seller acknowledges that a remedy at Law for
any breach or attempted breach of this _Section 5.14_ may be inadequate and
further agrees that any breach of this _Section 5.14_ may result in
irreparable harm to Buyer or the Company, and Buyer shall, in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it, be entitled to specific performance
and injunctive and other equitable relief in case of any such breach or
attempted breach.

5.15 _Nonassignability of Directly Transferred Assets_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
except as addressed on Schedule 8.2(f)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
to the extent that the contribution, conveyance, transfer, assignment or
delivery, or attempted contribution, conveyance, transfer, assignment or
delivery, to Buyer (or any designated Subsidiary of Buyer Parent) of any
asset that would be a Directly Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom in accordance with _Section
2.1(c) _is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any governmental
or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers (each, a "
_Consent_ "), and such Consent shall not have been obtained prior to the
Closing, the consummation of the Direct Transfers shall proceed without the
contribution, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery of such asset. In
such event, (a) the asset requiring Consent that was not obtained shall be
regarded as a Directly Transferred Asset for purposes of the calculation of
Net Working Capital under the EPA as if such asset is a current asset and (b)
Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts, and
cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such Consent. Pending receipt
of such Consent, Seller shall (or shall cause its relevant Subsidiary to)
hold the applicable Directly Transferred Asset for the benefit of Buyer (or
any designated Subsidiary of Buyer Parent), and Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful
arrangements designed to provide to Buyer (or any designated Subsidiary of
Buyer Parent) the benefits of use of such asset and to Seller and its
Subsidiaries the benefits, including any indemnities, that they would have
obtained had the asset been conveyed to Buyer (or any designated Subsidiary of
Buyer Parent) as of the Closing. Promptly following the receipt of such
Consent, Seller shall (or shall cause its relevant Subsidiary to)
convey, transfer, assign and deliver such asset to Buyer (or any designated
Subsidiary of Buyer Parent) at no additional cost.

required by this Agreement to be borne by Buyer, (c) any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in _Sections 4.1_ ( _Organization, Good
Standing and Qualification_ ), 4.2 ( _Authorization_ ) and 4.3(a) (
_Governmental Filings; No Violations_ ) or (d) any breach of any Post-Closing
Covenant of Buyer or Buyer Parent contained in this Agreement.

  



  

8.4   _Third Party Claim Procedures_.

  



  

(a)  In the event that any written claim or demand for which an
indemnifying party under this _ARTICLE VIII_ (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
may have liability to any Indemnified Person hereunder is asserted against or
sought to be collected from any Indemnified Person by a third party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Person shall promptly, but in no
event more than ten (10) Business Days following such Indemnified Person's
receipt of a Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such Third Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought
thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim), any other remedy
sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the
extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a " _Claim
Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure timely to give a
Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Person hereunder only
to the extent that such failure has a prejudicial effect on the defenses or
other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days (or such
lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by
court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the
Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Person that
it desires to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim;
_it being understood that_ the Indemnifying Party shall only be permitted to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if such Third Party Claim (i) is not
a criminal or quasi-criminal action and (ii) does not seek material
injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Person.  The
Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to, nor shall the Indemnifying Party
be deemed to, acknowledge or admit that it has an indemnity obligation with
respect to a Third Party Claim as a condition to, or by virtue of, electing to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim.

  



  

   

-66-

 



    



  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Person within the Notice Period that it desires to defend
the Indemnified Person against a Third Party Claim in accordance with
_Section 8.4(a)_ , the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the
Indemnified Person by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to
direct and control such defense at its expense. Once the Indemnifying Party
has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such
defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnifying
Party shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments related to the
conduct and defense such Third Party Claim as provided by the Indemnified
Person. The Indemnified Person shall participate in any such defense at
its expense unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person are
both named parties to the proceedings and the Indemnified Person shall have
reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them, or (ii) the Indemnified Person assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third
Party Claim it has assumed, as provided in the first sentence of _Section
8.4(c)_. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Person, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise
any portion of a Third Party Claim unless the terms of such settlement (A) do
not restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Person or any
of its Affiliates, (B) do not include or require a finding or admission of a
violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Person or any of its Affiliates, (C) do not include or require a finding or
admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims made or
threatened against the Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (D) do
not result in any monetary liability of the Indemnified Person that will not
be promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party and (E) provide for
a complete and unconditional release of the claims that are the subject of
such Third Party Claim in favor of the Indemnified Person with prejudice.

  



  

(c)  If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the
Indemnified Person against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the
Indemnified Person timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise or
(ii) after assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within
ten (10) Business Days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified
Person to the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its
own defense; _it being understood that_ the Indemnified Person's right to
indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Person shall
not settle a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(d)  The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party
Claim, including by providing access to each other's relevant business records
and other documents, and employees; _it being understood that_ the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Indemnified Person relating
thereto shall be Losses.

  



  

   

-67-

 



    



  

(e) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Party shall use
reasonable best efforts to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim
to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-
product privileges.

  



  

8.5   _Adjustments to Losses_.

  



  

(a)  In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates under
any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment
by or against any other Person in each case relating to a claim under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ , net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in
connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted,
except to the extent that the adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit
the coverage of all or part of such Loss. In the event that an Indemnified
Person has any rights against a third party with respect to any occurrence,
claim or loss that results in a payment by an Indemnifying Party under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ , such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to such rights
to the extent of such payment; _provided that_ until the Indemnified Person
recovers full payment of a Loss that does not result from a Third Party
Claim, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third
party on account of said indemnity payment is hereby expressly made
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Indemnified Person's
rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of
any other provision hereof, each Indemnified Person and Indemnifying Party
shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the subrogation and subordination rights detailed
herein, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims.

  



  

(b)  In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be
deducted an amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually realized as a result
of such Loss by the party claiming such Loss by way of an actual reduction in
the amount of cash Taxes payable by such party in the year in which such Loss
is accrued, and there shall be added an amount equal to any Tax imposed on the
receipt of any indemnity payment with respect thereto.

  



  

(c)  If an Indemnified Person recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ , the Indemnified Person shall promptly remit
to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the
third party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of Loss.

  



  

(d)  Each Indemnified Person shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss to the extent required
by applicable Law.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) the obligations of Seller under _Section 8.2(d)_ and Buyer under _Section
8.3(d)_ shall each be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the sum of the
Closing Purchase Price, plus the amount of Earn-Out Consideration actually
paid to Seller, and (ii) the obligations of Seller under Section 8.2(f) in
respect of Schedule 8.2(f)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be
limited to an aggregate amount set forth in Schedule 8.2(f)(ii) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, and, in each case, no Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified, defended and held
harmless for any Losses in excess thereof.

  



  

   

-68-

 



    



    

8.6   _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts
payable pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ , by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Person of a
bill, together with all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up
documentation, for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder,
unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the Loss, in which event
it shall so notify the Indemnified Person. In any event, the Indemnifying
Party shall pay to the Indemnified Person, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the amount of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no
later than three (3) Business Days following any final determination of such
Loss and the Indemnifying Party's liability therefor. A "final determination"
shall exist when (a) the parties to the dispute have reached an agreement in
writing, (b) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final and
non-appealable order or judgment, or (c) an arbitration or like panel shall
have rendered a final non-appealable determination with respect to disputes
the parties have agreed to submit thereto. All payments made pursuant to this
_ARTICLE VIII_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price
for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax purposes, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

8.7   _Remedies_. Following the Closing, except for Fraud, the
rights and remedies of Buyer and Seller under this _ARTICLE VIII_ and
_Section 9.5_ are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and
remedies which Buyer or Seller may have under this Agreement or otherwise
against each other with respect to the matters set forth in _Section 8.2_
and _Section 8.3_, respectively, and each of Buyer and Seller expressly
waives any and all other rights or causes of action such Person or its
Affiliates may have against the other Party or its Affiliates now or in the
future under any Law with respect to the subject matter of _Section 8.2_ and
_Section 8.3_, respectively.

  



  

ARTICLE IX 
  
 Miscellaneous and General

  



  

9.1   _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party, or in the case of
a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure
or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Law.

  



  

9.2   _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions,
including all legal, investment banking, consulting and accounting fees and
related expenses, will be borne by Seller, to the extent incurred by Seller
or its Affiliates, or by Buyer, to the extent incurred by Buyer or its
Affiliates.

  



  

9.3   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered in any number of counterparts (including by facsimile or pdf), each
of which shall be deemed to be an original instrument, and all of which shall
together constitute the same agreement.

9.4   _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

  



  

(a)  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND INTERPRETED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAWS, RULES OR PRINCIPLES THEREOF (OR ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION) TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS, RULES OR PRINCIPLES WOULD REQUIRE
OR PERMIT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. Other than in
connection with the matters required to be submitted to and determined by the
Accountant (which shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 2.5(b)_ and
_Section 2.6_, as applicable), each Party agrees that it shall bring any
action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising under or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions exclusively in any federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
of The City of New York (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") and, solely in connection
with claims arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
(i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts,
(ii) waives and agrees not to assert any objection to the laying of venue in
any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts and (iii) waives and
agrees not to assert any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient
forum or do not have jurisdiction over any Party.

  



  

(b)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 9.4_.

  



  

9.5 _Specific Performance_. Each Party agrees that irreparable
damage to the other Parties would occur in the event that the Closing is not
consummated or the other obligations of the Parties are not performed, in each
case, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and that money damages
or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
It is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to an injunction to
prevent or restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the
other Parties and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such Party.
Each Party hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for specific
performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

9.6   _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other
document to be given hereunder by a Party to any other Party shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) upon actual receipt, if
delivered personally, (b) three (3) Business Days after deposit in the mail
if sent by registered or certified mail, (c) upon confirmation of successful
transmission if sent by facsimile or electronic mail (provided that such
notice, request, instruction or other document shall be confirmed within one
(1) Business Day by dispatch pursuant to one of the other methods described
herein) or (d) on the Business Day following deposit with an overnight
courier, in each case to the persons and addresses set forth below, or to

9.7   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits
and schedules hereto), constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all
other prior agreements, understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the

or be liable for, any alleged representation, promise, inducement or

-72-

 



    



  

9.8   _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in
_Section 9.13_ (Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney-Client Privilege), each of the
Parties hereby agrees that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of one or more of the
other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person
other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein;
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, (a) the Buyer Indemnified Persons
are intended third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce,  _Section 8.2_
and (b) the Seller Indemnified Persons are intended third party beneficiaries
of, and may enforce, _Section 8.3_.

  



  

9.9   _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a substitution therefor so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible so that the
Transactions may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application
of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by
such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

9.10   _Interpretation; Construction_.

  



  

(a)  The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to an Exhibit, Section or
Schedule, such reference shall be to an Exhibit, Section or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

  



  

(b)  The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and
drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  The disclosure by any Party of any information in a
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to imply or constitute an admission or
indication that (i) any liability exists with respect to such disclosure, (ii)
any breach or violation of Law or contract exists or has actually occurred,
(iii) such information is material or (iv) such information is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement.

  



  

9.11 _Assignment_. No Party may assign any of its rights or delegate
any of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law
or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, except
that, subject to the obligations set forth in _Section 2.6_, Buyer may
assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement from and after the
Closing, to the purchaser in a Sale of the Business, _provided that_ (a) no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder
and (b) the obligations set forth in _Section 5.14 _shall be specific to
Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Any purported assignment in violation of this
Agreement is void.

  



  

   

-73-

 



    



  

9.12   _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any Party to
any other Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed,
satisfied or fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be
deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

  



  

9.13   _Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney -Client Privilege_.

  



  

(a)  Buyer acknowledges that SandC (i) currently serves as counsel
to Seller and its Subsidiaries, including the Company, including in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) may serve as
counsel to Seller and its Affiliates following the Closing, including in
connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the Transactions,
including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Company) hereby (A)
waives any claim that SandC has a conflict of interest or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in such representation and (B) agrees that, in the
event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or the Company on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, SandC may
represent Seller or any of its Affiliates in such dispute even though the
interests of such Person may be directly adverse to Buyer or its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing, the Company) and even though SandC may have
represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related
to such dispute.

  



  

(b)  Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing, the Company) agrees that, as to all communications
prior to the Closing between SandC, on the one hand, and one or more of Seller,
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the other hand, to
the extent that they relate to the Transactions, the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may be
controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Company). In addition, all
of the client files and records in the possession of SandC related to this
Agreement and the Transactions shall continue to be the property of Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Company), on the one
hand, and a third party other than a Party to this Agreement, on the other
hand, then the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by SandC to such third party;
provided, however, that none of the Company or its Subsidiaries may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.

  



  

9.14   _Seller Parent Guarantee_. Seller Parent hereby fully
guarantees the due, prompt and full performance, payment and discharge when
due of all the covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings of Seller
under this Agreement.

  



     

9.15   _Buyer Parent Guarantee_. Buyer Parent hereby fully guarantees
the due, prompt and full performance, payment and discharge when due of all
the covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings of Buyer under this
Agreement.
