"); or

 



 

C. each Lares Common Share that is deemed to be a No Election Share shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election
Consideration and/or the Stock Election Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.3(c)_ ;

 



 

(ii) each share or other security representing limited liability company
interests in Lares held in the treasury of Lares or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Lares or any of Lares' Subsidiaries or Mercury or any of
Mercury's Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time
(collectively, " _Lares Cancelled Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor, and each Lares Preferred Share shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor; and

 



 

(iii) the limited liability company interests in Merger Sub 2 outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall be converted into
100 Lares Class A Shares, which shall constitute one hundred percent (100%) of
the limited liability company interest in the Surviving Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
total number of Lares Common Shares that will be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Consideration shall be equal to (i) 27,426,312,
minus (ii) the number of Lares Dissenting Shares as of immediately prior to
the Second Merger Effective Time (such number of Lares Common Shares, the "
_Cash Election Cap_ ").

 



 

(c) At the Second Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger
and without any action on the part of Mercury, New Holdco, Merger Sub 2, Lares
or any shareholder or member thereof, New Holdco shall be admitted as the sole
member of Lares, shall hold all of the outstanding limited liability company
interests in Lares and agrees to be bound by the Lares LLC Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.3 _Election Procedures and Proration_.

 



 

(a) An election form, prepared by Mercury and reasonably acceptable to
Lares (the " _Election Form_ "), pursuant to which a holder (or, in the case
of nominee holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) of Lares Common Shares may make an Election as specified in
_Section 2.3(c)_ , shall be mailed on a date to be mutually agreed by Mercury
and Lares that is not more than forty five (45) and not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the anticipated Closing Date or on such other date that Mercury
and Lares shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of
record of Lares Common Shares as of the close of business on a Business Day
prior to the Mailing Date selected by Lares and reasonably acceptable to
Mercury (or as of such other record date for determining the holders entitled
to receive such Election Form as may be mutually agreed upon by Lares and
Mercury). The Election Form shall specify that delivery of certificates
representing Lares Common Shares (" _Lares Certificates_ ") (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or the transfer of Lares Common Shares held in book-
entry form (" _Lares Book-Entry Securities_ ") to the Exchange Agent in
connection with the making of an Election shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Lares Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the Lares Book-Entry
Securities to the Exchange Agent and shall otherwise include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the
book-entry transfer of Lares Book-Entry Securities and instructions for making
Elections and effecting the surrender of Lares Certificates and Lares Book-
Entry Securities in connection with the making of an Election.

 



 

(b) Mercury shall make available one or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of Lares Common Shares prior to the close of business
on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline. Lares shall provide to the
Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform the
obligations specified in this _Section 2.3_ and as specified in any agreement
among the parties and the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(c) Each Person who is a record holder of Lares Common Shares at the time
of the Election Deadline will be entitled, with respect to all or any portion
of the Lares Common Shares held by such Person other than with respect to
Lares Common Shares that constitute Lares Dissenting Shares at the Election
Deadline, to make prior to the Election Deadline an election (an " _Election_
") specifying (x) the number of such holder's Lares Common Shares with respect
to which such holder makes a Cash Election (each share in respect of which a
holder makes a valid and effective Cash Election, a " _Cash Election Share_ ",
and the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares of all holders who have made
such an Election, the " _Cash Election Total_ "); and (y) the number of such
holder's Lares Common Shares with respect to which such holder makes a Stock
Election (each share in respect of which a holder duly makes a valid and
effective Stock Election, a " _Stock Election Share_ "). Any Lares Common
Shares (other than any Lares Cancelled Shares and any Lares Dissenting Shares)
with respect to which no Election is validly and effectively made prior to the
Election Deadline shall be deemed to be " _No Election Shares_ ", and shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration and/or the
Stock Consideration, as determined in accordance with this _Section 2.3(c)_.
Mercury shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the following prorations to
the Merger Consideration:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) If the Cash Election Total is greater than the Cash Election Cap, then
(A) each Stock Election Share and each No Election Share shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration; and (B) each Cash
Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive (I) an amount in
cash (without interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election
Consideration, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Cash Election Cap and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election
Total (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ "), and (II) a number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock
equal to the product of the Stock Election Consideration multiplied by a
fraction equal to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

 



 

(ii) If the Cash Election Total is less than the Cash Election Cap (the
number of Lares Common Shares by which the Cash Election Total is less than
the Cash Election Cap, the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then (A) each Cash
Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election
Consideration; and (B)(I) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the
aggregate number of No Election Shares, then (x) each Stock Election Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and (y)
each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election
Consideration, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of No
Election Shares (such fraction, the " _Shortfall Fraction_ "), and (2) a
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of New Holdco
Voting Common Stock equal to the product of the Stock Election Consideration
multiplied by a fraction equal to one (1) minus the Shortfall Fraction, and
(II) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of No Election
Shares (the number of Lares Common Shares by which the Shortfall Number
exceeds the aggregate number of No Election Shares, the " _Shortfall Excess_
"), then (x) each No Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Consideration, and (y) each Stock Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election Consideration, multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Excess, and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (such
fraction, the " _Excess Fraction_ "), and (2) a number of validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock equal to
the product of the Stock Election Consideration multiplied by a fraction equal
to one (1) minus the Excess Fraction.

 



 

(iii) If the Cash Election Cap is equal to the Cash Election Total, then
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply, and each Cash Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election
Consideration, and each Stock Election Share and each No Election Share shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, an Election shall be
effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, no later than 5:00
p.m. New York time on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing Date
(or such later date as Mercury and Lares shall agree) (the " _Election
Deadline_ ") (i) an Election Form covering the Lares Common Shares to which
such Election applies, executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions set forth therein, and (ii) the Lares Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof), or in the case of Lares Book-Entry Securities,
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) to which
such Election Form applies. An Election may be revoked or changed only by
delivering to the Exchange Agent, prior to the Election Deadline, a written
notice of revocation or, in the case of a change, a properly completed revised
Election Form that identifies the Lares Common Shares to which such revised
Election Form applies. Delivery to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election
Deadline of a revised Election Form with respect to any Lares Common Shares
shall result in the revocation of all prior Election Forms with respect to all
such Lares Common Shares. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including
any rules established pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ , and of the Election Form,
the Exchange Agent, in consultation with both Mercury and Lares, shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decision of the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Mercury, New Holdco,
Lares or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligations to notify any
Person of any defect in an Election Form. Mercury shall use reasonable best
efforts to announce the Election Deadline at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Election Deadline. Upon mutual agreement of Mercury and Lares in
writing on or prior to the Closing Date (but in all events before the Second
Merger Effective Time), Election Forms submitted after the Election Deadline
may be accepted and treated as effective, but only so long as all properly
completed late Election Forms received by the Exchange Agent before the time
specified in such writing for acceptance of late Election Forms (the " _Late
Election Time_ ") are accepted and treated as effective. The Late Election
Time must be a time at least one (1) hour after the execution of the writing
in which Mercury and Lares agree to accept such late Election Forms and will
be no later than the Second Merger Effective Time. Mercury and Lares shall
have no obligation to publicly announce or otherwise give notice to holders of
Lares Common Shares that a Late Election Time has been fixed or that late
Election Forms will be accepted. Neither Mercury nor Lares shall be under any
obligation to agree to accept any late Election Forms, and a determination to
agree to accept any late Election Forms shall be made in the sole and absolute
discretion of each of Mercury and Lares. No late Election Forms will be
accepted and treated as effective, unless Mercury and Lares mutually agree to
such treatment in writing in accordance with, and as expressly provided in,
this _Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Mercury Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
New Holdco, Mercury and the Mercury Board and the Compensation Committee of
the Mercury Board shall take all actions necessary so that, as of the First
Merger Effective Time:

 



 

(i) each Mercury Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
First Merger Effective Time shall be assumed by New Holdco and become an
option (a " _Mercury Exchange Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions (including applicable vesting requirements) as applied to each such
Mercury Stock Option immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the
number of shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock that is equal to the number
of shares of Mercury Voting Common Stock subject to such Mercury Stock Option
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, at an exercise price per
share of New Holdco Voting Common Stock equal to the exercise price for each
such share of Mercury Voting Common Stock subject to such Mercury Stock Option
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time (including applicable
vesting, exercise and expiration provisions); and

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) each share of Mercury Restricted Stock and each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Mercury Voting Common Stock or
benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of
Mercury Voting Common Stock granted by Mercury outstanding immediately prior
to the First Merger Effective Time (including Mercury DSUs, restricted stock
units, phantom units, deferred stock units, stock equivalents and dividend
equivalents), other than Mercury Stock Options (each, other than Mercury Stock
Options, a " _Mercury Stock-Based Award_ "), shall be assumed by New Holdco
and become an award, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable
vesting requirements and deferral provisions) as applied to each such Mercury
Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, with
respect to the number of shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock that is
equal to the number of shares of Mercury Voting Common Stock subject to the
Mercury Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
(a " _Mercury Exchange Stock-Based Award_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
shares of Mercury Voting Common Stock issued in connection with the settlement
of Mercury Stock-Based Awards which vest on or prior to the First Merger
Effective Time (including vested Mercury Restricted Stock) shall be treated in
the manner set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_.

 



 

(b) New Holdco shall file, no later than fifteen (15) days after the First
Merger Effective Time, an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) under the Securities Act to register
shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Mercury
Exchange Options and Lares Exchange Options and settlement of Mercury Exchange
Stock-Based Awards and Lares Exchanged Stock-Based Awards.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Lares Share Options and Other Share-Based Awards_. Prior to
the Second Merger Effective Time, the Board of Directors of New Holdco, Lares
and the Lares Board and the Compensation Committee of the Lares Board shall
take all actions necessary so that:

 



 

(a) each Lares Share Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Merger Effective Time shall be assumed by New Holdco and become, as of
the Second Merger Effective Time, an option (a " _Lares Exchange Option_ ") to
purchase, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting,
exercise and expiration provisions) as applied to each such Lares Share Option
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, shares of New Holdco
Voting Common Stock, except that (i) the number of shares of New Holdco Voting
Common Stock subject to the Lares Exchange Option shall equal the product of
the number of Lares Class A Shares that were subject to such Lares Share
Option immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time multiplied by the
Lares Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number
and (ii) the per share exercise price of each such Lares Exchange Option will
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share
at which such Lares Share Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Second Merger Effective Time by the Lares Exchange Ratio, with the result
rounded up to the nearest whole cent;

 



 

 



   



 

(b) each share of Lares Restricted Shares and each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Lares Class A Shares or benefits
measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of Lares Class A Shares
granted by Lares outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective
Time (including restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred stock units,
stock equivalents and dividend equivalents), other than Lares Share Options
(each, other than Lares Share Options, a " _Lares Share-Based Award_ "), shall
become, as of the Second Merger Effective Time, an award, on the same terms
and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements) as applied to each
such Lares Share-Based Award immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective
Time, with respect to the number of shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock
that is equal to the product of the number of Lares Class A Shares that were
subject to such Lares Share-Based Award immediately prior to the Second Merger
Effective Time multiplied by the Lares Exchange Ratio (a " _Lares Exchange
Share-Based Award_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, Lares Class A Shares issued
in connection with the settlement of Lares Share-Based Awards which vest on or
prior to the Second Merger Effective Time (including vested Lares Restricted
Shares) shall be treated in the manner set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ ; and

 



 

(c) if the employment of a holder of a Lares Exchange Option or Lares
Exchange Share-Based Award is involuntarily terminated by New Holdco or any of
its Subsidiaries within twelve (12) months after the Second Merger Effective
Time (other than for Cause (as defined below)), all of the then unvested Lares
Exchange Options or Lares Exchange Share-Based Awards held by such holder
shall become fully vested upon such termination and, in the case of a Lares
Exchange Option, shall be exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days
following the effective date of such termination (or, with respect to a Lares
Exchange Option that has vested prior to such termination, such longer period
as may be applicable to such Lares Exchange Option upon such termination of
employment, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Lares Exchange
Option as of the Second Merger Effective Time). For purposes of this _Section
2.5(c)_ , the term " _Cause_ " means, with respect to any holder, such holder
(i) has been convicted of, or entered a pleading of guilty or _nolo contendre_
(or its equivalent in the applicable jurisdiction) to any criminal offense
(whether or not in connection with the performance by the employee of his or
her obligations and duties to New Holdco and/or any of its Subsidiaries),
excluding offenses under road traffic laws, or misdemeanor offenses, that are
subject only to a fine or non-custodial penalty; (ii) has willfully failed to
perform the duties properly assigned to him or her by New Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries, and such holder has the physical capacity to perform such
duties; or (iii) has engaged in gross negligence or willful misconduct with
respect to New Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.6 _Exchange of Mercury Shares_. Pursuant to Section 13.1-719.1
of the VSCA, each certificate that, immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time, represented shares of Mercury Voting Common Stock or shares of
Mercury Non-Voting Common Stock, and all shares of Mercury Voting Common Stock
and Mercury Non-Voting Common Stock held in book-entry form immediately prior
to the First Merger Effective Time, shall, from and after the First Merger
Effective Time, represent an equal number of shares of New Holdco Voting
Common Stock and New Holdco Non-Voting Common Stock, respectively.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Exchange of Lares Shares_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Mailing Date, Mercury shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to Lares (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as paying and exchange
agent, including for purposes of (i) receiving Election Forms and determining,
in accordance with this Article II, the form of Merger Consideration to be
received by each holder of Lares Common Shares and (ii) exchanging Lares
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Lares Book-Entry
Securities for the Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date, Mercury or New
Holdco shall deposit or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Lares Certificates and Lares Book-Entry
Securities, (i) shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock sufficient in order
for the Exchange Agent to distribute the Stock Election Consideration, and
(ii) an amount of cash sufficient in order for the Exchange Agent to
distribute the Cash Election Consideration. In addition, New Holdco shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the
Second Merger Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.7(g)_ and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_. The shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock and
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Lares
Common Shares are collectively referred to herein as the " _Lares Exchange
Fund_ ". In connection with the foregoing, Mercury and New Holdco shall enter
into an Exchange Agent Agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Lares, setting forth the procedures to be used in determining,
in accordance with this _Article II_ , the form of Merger Consideration to be
received by each holder of Lares Common Shares, and accomplishing the
deliveries and other actions contemplated by this _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Closing Date, New Holdco shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Lares Common Shares, to the extent
the holder thereof has not submitted Lares Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Lares Book-Entry Securities with an Election Form prior to
the Closing Date, a letter of transmittal in a form prepared by Mercury and
reasonably acceptable to Lares (a " _Lares Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Lares Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the Lares Book-Entry Securities to the
Exchange Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form and shall
include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message"
regarding the book-entry transfer of Lares Book-Entry Securities) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Lares Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Lares Book-Entry Securities in exchange
for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Each holder of Lares Common Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Lares Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof), together with a properly completed Lares Letter of
Transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of book-entry transfer of Lares Book-Entry Securities,
the Merger Consideration in respect of the Lares Common Shares represented by
a Lares Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Lares Book-Entry
Security. The shares of New Holdco Voting Common Stock constituting part of
the Merger Consideration shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is requested by a holder of Lares Common Shares or is
otherwise required under applicable Law. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Lares Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Lares Book-Entry
Securities upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable Lares Common Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to
such exchange that (i) either such Lares Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or such Lares Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
shall otherwise be in proper form for the transfer or such Lares Book-Entry
Security shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to New Holdco any transfer Taxes or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment of such consideration to a Person other than that of the
registered holder of the Lares Certificate (or Lares Common Shares specified
in an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) and/or Lares Book-Entry Security so
surrendered, or such Person shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
New Holdco that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(d) From and after the Second Merger Effective Time, until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.7_ , each Lares Certificate and/or Lares Book-
Entry Security shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender, in each case together with a duly executed and properly
completed Lares Letter of Transmittal, certificates or evidence of shares in
book-entry form representing the Merger Consideration that the holder of such
Lares Certificate and/or Lares Book-Entry Security is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ , and any cash payment that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ and _Section 2.7(g)_. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any such consideration. The issuance
or payment of the Merger Consideration and the payment of any cash payment
required to be made pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ in respect of Lares Common
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Lares Common
Shares (other than the right to receive dividends or other distributions, if
any, in accordance with _Section 2.7(g)_ ).

 



 

(e) No certificates or book-entry securities representing less than one
share of New Holdco Voting Common Stock shall be issued in the Second Merger
as a result of the conversion provided for in _Section 2.1(b)_ , but in lieu
thereof each Lares Shareholder otherwise entitled to a fractional share of New
Holdco Voting Common Stock (after aggregating the total number of shares of
New Holdco Voting Common Stock that such Lares Shareholder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ ) shall be entitled to receive from New
Holdco, in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.7(e)_ , a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional shares equal to (i) the fraction of a share
of New Holdco Voting Common Stock, as applicable, that such Lares Shareholder
would otherwise be entitled to multiplied by (ii) the average daily volume
weighted average price of the Mercury Voting Common Stock on the NYSE for the
five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date. The
parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to New Holdco that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares.

 



 

 



   



 

(f) After the Second Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of Lares of Lares Common Shares which have been
converted, pursuant to this Agreement, into the right to receive the
consideration set forth herein, and if any Lares Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) and/or Lares Book-Entry Securities, together with a
duly executed and properly completed Lares Letter of Transmittal, are
presented to the Exchange Agent, New Holdco or the Surviving Company for
transfer they shall be cancelled and exchanged, without interest, for the
Merger Consideration received by the No Election Shares as provided in
_Section 2.3(c)_ (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to _Section 2.7(e)_ ).

 



 

(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to New Holdco Common
Stock with a record date after the Second Merger Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Lares Common Shares with respect to the
shares of New Holdco Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends
and other distributions shall be paid by New Holdco to the Exchange Agent and
shall be included in the Lares Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender
of such Lares Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Lares
Book-Entry Security in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Lares Certificate or Lares Book-Entry
Security (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the
holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Second Merger Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of New Holdco Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Second Merger Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of New Holdco Common Stock.

 



 

(h) None of Mercury, New Holdco, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, or Lares
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any New Holdco Common Shares (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) for any amount required to be
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(i) If any Lares Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon such Person's (i) making of an affidavit of that fact claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, (ii) delivery to New Holdco of a
bond of indemnity in an amount and upon terms reasonably satisfactory to New
Holdco, and (iii) execution and delivery of a Lares Letter of Transmittal, New
Holdco will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
the amount and type of consideration to be paid in respect of each Lares
Common Share represented by such certificate in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(j) Any portion of the Lares Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Lares Common Shares twelve (12) months after the Closing Date shall
be returned to New Holdco, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged Lares Common Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this _Section 2.7_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to New Holdco
for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions
with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 2.7(g)_ and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ , in respect of such shares
without any interest thereon.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of New Holdco, Mercury, the
Surviving Corporation, Lares, the Surviving Company and any of their
respective Subsidiaries (and any agent acting on behalf of any of them,
including the Exchange Agent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. Any such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by New Holdco, Mercury, the Surviving
Corporation, Lares, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of any of them (or
any agent acting on behalf of any of them, including the Exchange Agent), as
the case may be, to the appropriate Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.9 _Adjustments_. In the event that, at any time during the
period from the date hereof to the Second Merger Effective Time, Lares or
Mercury, as applicable, changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of Lares Common Shares issued and outstanding, or the number of
shares of Mercury Common Stock issued and outstanding, as a result of a stock-
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or any similar transaction, in each case other
than pursuant to transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionally adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of such change.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Dissenting Shares_. Pursuant to the Lares LLC Agreement,
the holders of each Lares Common Share are entitled to rights of appraisal in
the event of a merger of Lares that would give rise to appraisal rights under
the DGCL if Lares were a Delaware corporation and the holders of Lares Common
Shares were stockholders of such corporation. Accordingly, and notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each Lares Common
Share to which the holder thereof would be entitled to demand appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, if Lares were a Delaware corporation and
the holders of Lares Common Shares were stockholders of such corporation, and
shall have properly demanded appraisal in compliance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a " _Lares Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such
holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Company, of the
fair value of the Lares Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) if any holder of Lares Dissenting Shares, under the
circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively
withdraws its demand for appraisal of such Lares Dissenting Shares, or (b) if
any holder of Lares Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the
consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for its
shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such Lares Common Shares and such Lares
Common Shares shall thereupon cease to constitute Lares Dissenting Shares and
such Lares Common Shares shall be deemed to be No Election Shares and
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Cash Election
Consideration and/or the Stock election Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.3(c)_. Lares shall give Mercury prompt notice of any demands
received by Lares for appraisal of Lares Common Shares, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Lares LLC Agreement
and Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Mercury the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. Lares
shall not, without the prior written consent of Mercury, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

Mercury and its Subsidiaries. No Mercury Benefit Plan is a "funded welfare
plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code. Except as would not

and the document(s) evidencing such plan substantially comply with, Section
409A of the Code, including all guidance and regulations issued thereunder.

of Mercury or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of
any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to

made by Mercury or its Subsidiaries that may be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. No
person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-
up or other payment) from Mercury or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of
the imposition of the excise taxes required by section 4999 of the Code or any
taxes required by section 409A of the Code.

this _Section 6.3_ shall (i) require, or be construed to require, New Holdco,
Mercury or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any
Regulatory Action unless all Regulatory Divestitures of Lares Stations and all
Regulatory Impositions would not result in the Net Lost Annual BCF exceeding
the Maximum Required Amount; (ii) require, or be construed to require, New

contemplated hereby or (iii) authorize or permit, or be construed to authorize
or permit, Lares or any of its Subsidiaries to take any Regulatory Action
without the prior written consent of Mercury.

 



 

(e) Lares agrees to work in good faith in connection with Mercury's
efforts to structure any Regulatory Actions in a manner that Mercury believes

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.3(a)_ , but subject to
_Section 6.3(d)_ :

 



 

(i) Within twelve (12) Business Days of the date of this Agreement,
Mercury and Lares shall, and as necessary or advisable shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, file the FCC Applications relating to those FCC
Licenses issued under Part 73 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Mercury and Lares
shall, and as necessary or advisable shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, file the remainder of the FCC Applications. Mercury and Lares shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as promptly as practicable.
Mercury and Lares shall each pay 50% of the FCC filing fees relating to the

FCC Rules to be paid by Mercury, Lares or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated.

 



 

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Mercury and Lares shall, and/or shall cause their respective ultimate parent
entities to file Notification and Report Forms with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR
Act, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for
additional information or documentation. Mercury and Lares shall each pay 50%
of the filing fees payable under the HSR Act by New Holdco, Mercury, Lares
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, irrespective of whether the

(iii) To avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC

the FCC apply its policy of permitting the assignment or transfer of control
of the FCC Licenses in transactions involving multiple stations to proceed,
notwithstanding the pendency of any Renewal Application, and (ii) to make such
representations and undertakings as are necessary or appropriate to invoke
such policy, including undertakings to assume, as between the parties and the
FCC, the position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending
Renewal Application and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating
to any such Renewal Application. In addition, Mercury and Lares acknowledge
that, to the extent reasonably necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of
any Renewal Application with respect to any Station and thereby to facilitate
the grant of the FCC Consent with respect to such Station, each of Mercury,
Lares and their applicable Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter into
tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the
FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Station in

that contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any other
enforcement matters against such Station with respect to which the FCC may
permit Mercury or Lares (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to enter
into a tolling agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the
original effective periods of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, Mercury and Lares
shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of
the effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the
transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, Lares and Mercury
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the
FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. No extension
of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of Mercury and Lares to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of Lares and Mercury shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and

and, during such period, each of such parties shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably request.
Neither Lares nor Mercury nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree
or fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Each of Lares and Mercury shall use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement
shall be subject to the provisions of that certain confidentiality agreement,
dated as of December 4, 2013, by and between Mercury and LIN Television

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Second Merger Effective Time, the employees of
Mercury and its Subsidiaries who are employed by New Holdco and its
Subsidiaries as of the First Merger Effective Time who remain employed by New
Holdco and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Mercury Continuing Employees_ ") and the employees of Lares and
its Subsidiaries who are employed by the New Holdco and its Subsidiaries as of
the Second Merger Effective Time and who remain employed by New Holdco or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries)
thereafter (the " _Lares Continuing Employees_ ", and together with the
Mercury Continuing Employees, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") will continue to
participate and have coverage or will be offered participation and coverage
under the applicable Mercury Benefit Plans, Lares Benefit Plans or employee
benefit plans adopted or implemented by New Holdco or its Subsidiaries at or
following the Closing (each, a " _New Benefit Plan_ ", and, together with the
Mercury Benefit Plans and the Lares Benefit Plans following the Closing, the "
_Merger Benefit Plans_ "), or a combination thereof, as determined by Lares
and Mercury prior to or following the Second Merger Effective Time, and
without duplication of benefits.

 



 

(b) New Holdco shall cause, to the extent applicable, (i) each Mercury
Benefit Plan in which Lares Continuing Employees become eligible to
participate, (ii) each Lares Benefit Plan in which Mercury Continuing
Employees become eligible to participate and (iii) each New Benefit Plan in
which Continuing Employees become eligible to participate, to take into
account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (solely, in
the case of benefit accruals, with respect to Merger Benefit Plans that are
not defined benefit plans or provide post-retirement health or welfare
benefits, except as required by applicable Law or under any Merger Benefit
Plan that replaces a comparable Mercury Benefit Plan or Lares Benefit Plan, as
applicable), the service of such Continuing Employees with Lares and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and Mercury and its Subsidiaries
(and any predecessor entities), as applicable, to the same extent as such
service was credited for such purpose, with respect to a Mercury Continuing
Employee, by Mercury and its Subsidiaries and, with respect to Lares
Continuing Employees, by Lares and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service or with respect to New Benefit Plans for which prior service is not
taken into account or with respect to plans for which participation and/or
service is frozen.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) At and following the Second Merger Effective Time, New Holdco shall,
and shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to, as applicable, honor the accrued
and vested obligations of Mercury and Lares and their respective Subsidiaries
as of the Second Merger Effective Time under the provisions of the Mercury
Benefit Plans, Mercury Employment Agreements, Lares Benefit Plans, Lares
Employment Agreements, and New Benefit Plans, as applicable; _provided_ that
this provision shall not prevent New Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries from
amending, suspending or terminating any such plans or agreements to the extent
permitted by the respective terms of such plans or agreements.

 



 

(d) If Lares Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in a
Mercury Benefit Plan or a New Benefit Plan, or Mercury Continuing Employees
become eligible to participate in a Lares Benefit Plan or a New Benefit Plan,
in each case that provides medical, dental or other health care insurance, New
Holdco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to
(i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions
are covered under the applicable medical, health, or dental plans of Mercury
or Lares, as applicable, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the First Merger Effective Time for the year in which the First
Merger Effective Time or participation in such medical, dental or other health
care insurance plan of Mercury or Lares, as applicable, occurs, in each case
to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous medical, dental or other health care insurance
plan of Lares or Mercury, as applicable, prior to the First Merger Effective
Time for the year in which the First Merger Effective Time or participation in
such medical, dental or health care insurance plan occurs.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.9_ , this _Section 6.5_
and _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.5_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each party to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.5_
or in _Section 2.4_ or _Section 2.5_ , express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person, including any current or former director,
officer or employee of Lares, Mercury or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 6.5_ or by reason of _Section 2.4_ or _Section 2.5_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent New Holdco, Mercury, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, the
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company from amending, suspending or
terminating any Lares Benefit Plans, Lares Employment Agreements, Mercury
Benefit Plans or Mercury Employment Agreements to the extent permitted by the
respective terms of such plans or agreements. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Lares
Benefit Plan, Lares Employment Agreement, Mercury Benefit Plan, Mercury
Employment Agreement or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or
arrangement of Mercury, Lares or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

 



   



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director or officer
may have under any indemnification agreement or under the Lares LLC Agreement,
from and after the Second Merger Effective Time, New Holdco shall cause the
Surviving Company or any applicable Subsidiary (excluding the Lares Non-
Managed Companies, the Lares Licensee Companies and the Mercury Licensee
Companies) (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnifying Parties_") thereto to: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was
previously, or during the period from the date hereof through the date of the
Second Merger Effective Time serving as a director or officer of Lares or such
Subsidiary (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") to the fullest
extent the Surviving Company or any such Subsidiary is so authorized or
permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with
any DandO Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim
Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from
such DandO Claim; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10)
Business Days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the DandO
Indemnified Parties, in each case to the fullest extent the Surviving Company
or the applicable Subsidiary is so authorized or permitted by applicable Law,
as now or hereafter in effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in defending,
serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect
to any DandO Claim in advance of the final disposition of such DandO Claim,
including payment on behalf of or advancement to the DandO Indemnified Party of
any Claim Expenses incurred by such DandO Indemnified Party in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement,
in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but
subject to the Surviving Company's receipt of a written undertaking by or on
behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is
ultimately determined under applicable Law that such DandO Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the DandO
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them
with respect to each such DandO Claim unless there is, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict between the positions of any two
or more DandO Indemnified Parties. To the extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law, the indemnification and advancement obligations of the
Surviving Company pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Second Merger Effective Time and any DandO
Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and
the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any DandO Claim relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director or officer of Lares or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such
Person's heirs, successors, executors, and personal and legal representatives.
As used in this _Section 6.6(a)_ : (x) the term " _D andO Claim_" means any
threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding or
inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any
Governmental Entity or any other Person, that any DandO Indemnified Party in
good faith believes might lead to the institution of any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism,
arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to (A) such DandO
Indemnified Party's duties or service as a director or officer of Lares or the
applicable Subsidiary thereto or (B) to the extent such person is or was
serving at the request or for the benefit of Lares or any of its Subsidiaries,
any other entity or any benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or
prior to the Second Merger Effective Time; and (y) the term " _Claim Expenses_
" means reasonable attorneys' fees and all other reasonable out-of-pocket
costs, expenses and obligations (including experts' fees, travel expenses,
court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding
costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any DandO Claim for which indemnification is
authorized pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ , including any action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a DandO Indemnified
Party. No DandO Indemnifying Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened DandO Claim in respect of
which indemnification has been sought by such DandO Indemnified Party hereunder
unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional
release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
DandO Claim, or such DandO Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, New Holdco and Lares agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Second Merger Effective Time now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of Lares or
any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Lares LLC Agreement and
indemnification agreements of Lares and its Subsidiaries shall survive the
Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For a period of six (6) years from the Second Merger Effective Time,
the Surviving Company LLC Agreement shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification and limitations on liability of directors and
officers than are set forth in the Lares LLC Agreement, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
from the Second Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time, were directors or officers of Lares or any of its
Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law and
then only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law. At Lares' option
and expense, prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, Lares may purchase
(and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six-year prepaid "tail"
insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Second
Merger) of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the directors, officers, agents or
fiduciaries of Lares or any of its Subsidiaries as Lares' and its
Subsidiaries' existing directors' and officers' insurance policy or policies,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Second Merger Effective Time
for DandO Claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the
Second Merger Effective Time; provided, however, that the premium for such
tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate
annual amounts currently paid by Lares and its Subsidiaries for such insurance
(such amount being the " _Lares Maximum Premium_ "). If Lares shall obtain
such tail policy prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, New Holdco or the
Surviving Company shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and shall cause Lares to honor all its obligations
thereunder. If Lares fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time, New Holdco or the Surviving Company shall obtain such a
tail policy, provided, however, that the premium for such tail policy shall
not exceed the Lares Maximum Premium; provided, further, that if such tail
policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual
premiums in excess of the Lares Maximum Premium, New Holdco or the Surviving
Company shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained
by paying an annual premium equal to the Lares Maximum Premium.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) If any of New Holdco or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of New Holdco or the Surviving Company, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

(d) New Holdco and the Surviving Company shall be jointly and severally
obligated to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.6_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such DandO Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay
such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the
express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party
(who are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_ ), his
or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of New Holdco and the Surviving Company and shall not
be amended after the Second Merger Effective Time in a manner that is adverse
to any DandO Indemnified Party (including their successors, assigns and heirs)
without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified Party (including the
successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and
indemnification provided for by this _Section 6.6_ shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which a DandO Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Mercury, on the one hand, and
Lares, on the other hand, shall promptly advise the other of any change or
event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Lares, in the case of Lares, or a Material Adverse Effect on Mercury, in the
case of Mercury, or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to comply with this _Section 6.7_
shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_
to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied.

(c) From and after the date hereof and until the Second Merger Effective
Time, none of Mercury, Lares or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
knowingly (i) take any action, or fail to take any reasonable action, as a
result of which the First Merger and the Second Merger, taken together, are
reasonably likely to fail to qualify as a transaction described in Section 351
of the Code or (ii) enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or
arrangement to take or fail to take any such action described in (i).

 



 

Section 6.9 _Approval Actions_. Immediately after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Mercury shall execute and deliver to Merger Sub 2
(with a copy to Lares) an irrevocable written consent approving and adopting
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Second
Merger (the " _Merger Sub 2 Member Approval_ ").

 



 

Section 6.10 _No Solicitation by Lares_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.10_ , from the date
hereof until the earlier of the Second Merger Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (i) Lares shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and (ii) Lares shall and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to use its and their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause the Representatives of Lares and of its Subsidiaries not to, directly
or indirectly:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Lares or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Lares;

 



 

(ii) furnish any non-public information regarding Lares or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person who has made or in response to an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Lares or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Lares;

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lares or Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to Lares (other than discussions in the ordinary course of business
that are unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, which
shall be permitted);

 



 

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Lares or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Lares or, subject to _Section
6.10(d)_, withdraw or propose to withdraw its approval and recommendation in
favor of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the First Merger and Second Merger; or

 



 

(v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other similar agreement
for any Acquisition Transaction with respect to Lares.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.10(a),_ if the Lares Board receives a bona
fide written Acquisition Inquiry from any Person (a " _Lares Inquiring Party_
") made after the date hereof but prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April
25, 2014 (the " _Lares Window Shop End Date_ ") and which did not result from
a breach of this _Section 6.10_ , Lares may, at any time prior to the Lares
Window Shop End Date, contact the Lares Inquiring Party to inquire as to the
financial capability of such Person to make a Lares Superior Offer, and if the
Lares Board or a committee thereof determines in its good faith judgment,
after consulting with outside counsel and a nationally recognized third party
financial advisor, that the Lares Inquiring Party could reasonably be expected
to have the financial capability necessary to make a Lares Superior Offer,
then Lares may, at any time prior to the Lares Window Shop End Date (A)
furnish to the Lares Inquiring Party (and its Representatives) the Approved
Lares Information, and (B) participate, together with its Representatives, in
up to two telephone conferences (not to exceed, in each case, ninety (90)
minutes in length) with Representatives of the Lares Inquiring Party to answer
questions regarding such information, but in any event only after the Lares
Inquiring Party enters into a customary confidentiality agreement with Lares
(which confidentiality agreement must be no less restrictive with respect to
the confidential treatment of information by such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement) (a " _Lares Confidentiality Agreement_ ");
_provided_ , that after any such determination by the Lares Board or a
committee thereof and before taking any of the actions described in the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), Lares shall give written notice to Mercury of
such determination. Lares shall promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours)
provide Mercury with any non-public information regarding Lares and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Lares or any of its Representatives to a
Lares Inquiring Party that shall not have been previously provided to Mercury
or any of its Representatives. Immediately following the Lares Window Shop End
Date, Lares shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any contact
with any Lares Inquiring Party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry, except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.10(c)_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 6.10(a)_ , if after the date hereof but prior
to the time that the Required Lares Transaction Vote is obtained (the " _Lares
Approval Time_ "), the Lares Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made after the date hereof but prior to the Lares Approval Time and
which has not resulted from a breach of this _Section 6.10_, and the Lares
Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with outside
counsel and a nationally recognized third party financial advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Lares Superior Offer, and, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Lares Board's fiduciary duties
to Lares Shareholders under applicable Law, then Lares may, at any time prior
to the Lares Approval Time (A) furnish information with respect to Lares and
its Subsidiaries to the Person or Persons (and its or their Representatives
and potential financing sources) making such Acquisition Proposal, but only
after such Person or Persons enter into a Lares Confidentiality Agreement and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or Persons
(and its or their Representatives and potential financing sources) regarding
any such Acquisition Proposal made by such Person or Persons; _provided_ ,
that Lares shall give written notice to Mercury after any such determination
by the Lares Board and before taking any of the actions described in the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B). Lares shall promptly (and in any event, within
24 hours) provide Mercury with all non-public information regarding Lares and
its Subsidiaries that is provided by Lares to a Person or Persons (or its or
their Representatives or potential financing sources) making such Acquisition
Proposal that shall not have been previously provided to Mercury or its
Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.10_ , in no event may Lares or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to
reimburse or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to
provide compensation to, any Person or Persons (or any of its or their
Representatives or potential financing sources) who makes an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Lares.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.10(d)_ , the Lares
Board shall not (i) (A) fail to make or withdraw or qualify, amend or modify
in any manner adverse to Mercury, or propose publicly to withdraw, or to
qualify, amend or modify, in any manner adverse to Mercury, the Lares Board
Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Lares Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being
understood that the following shall not constitute a Lares Adverse
Recommendation Change prohibited hereunder: (1) any "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, and (2) any
communication by Lares that expressly continues to recommend the transactions
contemplated hereby), (ii) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business combination" or
other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation inapplicable to any
transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize
Lares or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture
agreement or Contract or other instrument in respect of or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Lares (other than a Lares Confidentiality
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before the Lares
Approval Time, the Lares Board may effect a Lares Adverse Recommendation
Change (other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Lares) if the Lares Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consulting with outside counsel, that the failure to effect a Lares Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
Lares Board's fiduciary duties to the Lares Shareholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that Lares has provided Mercury four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice advising Mercury that it intends to take such action and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action, it being
understood that the delivery of such notice shall not itself constitute a
Lares Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 6.10(d)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, if the Lares Board
receives after the date hereof but before the Lares Approval Time a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (which did not result from a
violation of this _Section 6.10_ )) that the Lares Board determines in its
good faith judgment, after consulting with outside counsel and a nationally
recognized third party financial advisor, constitutes a Lares Superior Offer,
(i) Lares may (but in no event from and after the Lares Approval Time)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ to enter into a
definitive agreement to accept such Lares Superior Offer (and take an action
described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this _Section 6.10(d)_
contemporaneously therewith), if Lares pays the Lares Termination Fee required
to be paid by it pursuant to ___Section 8.3_ in connection with such
termination, or (ii) the Lares Board may make a Lares Adverse Recommendation
Change in connection with such Lares Superior Offer, but in each case
described in this sentence only (1) after the fourth (4th) Business Day (such
four (4) Business Day period, the " _Lares Notice Period_ ") following Lares'
delivery to Mercury of written notice (a " _Notice of Lares Superior Offer_
"), advising Mercury that the Lares Board is prepared to accept such Lares
Superior Offer and enter into a definitive agreement with respect hereto
(which notice shall include the form of definitive agreement Lares and the
Person that made such offer are prepared to enter into in connection with the
termination of this Agreement, any other information and material required to
be delivered under _Section 6.10(c)_ or _Section 6.10(d)_, as applicable,
that has not yet been provided to Mercury, and the identity of the Person or
Persons making such Acquisition Proposal) and terminate this Agreement or make
a Lares Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such Lares Superior
Offer (it being understood that any such Notice of Lares Superior Offer
regarding a Lares Adverse Recommendation Change shall not itself constitute a
Lares Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement) (and
during such Lares Notice Period, to the extent requested in writing by
Mercury, Lares and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with
Mercury and Mercury's Representatives with respect to any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute
a Lares Superior Offer), and (2) if after taking into consideration any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Mercury by 5
p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of such Lares Notice Period, the Lares Board
continues to believe in its good faith judgment, after consulting with outside
counsel and a nationally recognized third party financial advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Lares Superior Offer, and that,
after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to (i) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.10(h)_ or (ii) make a Lares Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with such Lares Superior Offer would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Lares Board's fiduciary duties
to the Lares Shareholders under applicable Law. Any (i) amendment to the
financial or other material terms of such Lares Superior Offer or (ii)
amendment to an Acquisition Proposal that the Lares Board had determined no
longer constitutes a Lares Superior Offer, shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal and shall require Lares to deliver to Mercury a new Notice of Lares
Superior Offer and a new Lares Notice Period (which shall be three (3),
instead of four (4), Business Days in length) shall commence thereafter.
Except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 6.10(d)_,
Lares shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall prohibit the Lares Board from
taking and disclosing to Lares' shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its shareholders required pursuant to
applicable Law if the Lares Board determines, in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or
applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Lares shall promptly advise Mercury orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal or Specific Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity
of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Specific
Acquisition Inquiry and the terms thereof and all material modifications
thereto) that is made or submitted by any Person during the period beginning
on the date hereof until the Second Merger Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If Lares receives
an Acquisition Proposal, Specific Acquisition Inquiry or any request for
discussions or negotiations that could reasonably be expected to be related to
an Acquisition Proposal, it shall (i) promptly notify Mercury (in the case of
a Specific Acquisition Inquiry, prior to the provision of any Approved Lares
Information to such Person and in the case of any Acquisition Proposal or
other request, within no more than 24 hours after any director, officer or
financial advisor of Lares is notified or becomes aware of the receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal or request) of the communication or receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, Specific Acquisition Inquiry or any request for
discussions or negotiations that could reasonably be expected to be related to
an Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal, Specific Acquisition
Inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions thereof, and (ii)
keep Mercury reasonably informed on a current basis of any material
developments in the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal,
Specific Acquisition Inquiry or request (including whether such Acquisition
Proposal, Specific Acquisition Inquiry or request has been withdrawn or
rejected and any material change to the terms thereof).

 



 

(g) Lares shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions existing as of the date of this Agreement with any Person that
relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in respect of Lares
proposed on or prior to the date hereof. Lares acknowledges and agrees that
any actions taken by or at the direction of a Representative of Lares or any
of its Subsidiaries that, if taken by Lares, would constitute a breach or
violation of this _Section 6.10_ will be deemed to constitute a breach and
violation of this _Section 6.10_ by Lares.

 



 

Section 6.11 _No Solicitation by Mercury_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Second Merger Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (i)
Mercury shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and (ii) Mercury
shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use its and their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of Mercury and of its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Mercury or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Mercury;

 



 

(ii) furnish any non-public information regarding Mercury or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person who has made or in response to an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Mercury or an Acquisition Inquiry with respect to
Mercury;

 



 

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Mercury or an Acquisition Inquiry
with respect to Mercury (other than discussions in the ordinary course of
business that are unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
which shall be permitted);

 



 

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Mercury or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Mercury; or

 



 

(v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other similar agreement
(other than a confidentiality agreement on the terms described below) for any
Acquisition Transaction with respect to Mercury.

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if after the date hereof but prior to the time
that the Required Mercury Vote is obtained (the " _Mercury Approval Time_ "),
the Mercury Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after
the date hereof but prior to the Mercury Approval Time and which has not
resulted from a breach of this _Section 6.11_ and the Mercury Board determines
in its good faith business judgment, after consulting with outside counsel and
a nationally recognized third party financial advisor, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Mercury
Superior Offer, and, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Mercury Board's fiduciary duties to Mercury
Shareholders under applicable Law, then Mercury may, at any time prior to the
Mercury Approval Time (A) furnish information with respect to Mercury and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or Persons (and its or their Representatives and
potential financing sources) making such Acquisition Proposal, but only after
such Person or Persons enter into a customary confidentiality agreement with
Mercury (which confidentiality agreement must be no less restrictive with
respect to the confidential treatment of information by such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement) (a " _Mercury Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or Persons (and
its or their Representatives and potential financing sources) regarding any
Acquisition Proposal made by such Person or Persons; _provided_ , that Mercury
shall give written notice to Lares after any such determination by the Mercury
Board and before taking any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses
(A) and (B). Mercury shall promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours)
provide Lares with all non-public information regarding Mercury and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Mercury to a Person or Persons (or its or
their Representatives or potential financing sources) making such Acquisition
Proposal that shall not have been previously provided to Lares or its
Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.11_ , in no event may Mercury or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to
reimburse or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to
provide compensation to, any Person or Persons (or any of its or their
Representatives or potential financing sources) who makes an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Mercury.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.11(b)_ , the Mercury
Board shall not (i) (A) fail to make or withdraw or qualify, amend or modify
in any manner adverse to Lares, or propose publicly to withdraw, or to
qualify, amend or modify, in any manner adverse to Lares, the Mercury Board
Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Mercury Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being
understood that the following shall not constitute a Mercury Adverse
Recommendation Change prohibited hereunder: (1) any "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, and (2) any
communication by Mercury that expressly continues to recommend the
transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) take any action to make the provisions
of any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation inapplicable
to any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or
authorize Mercury or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture
agreement or Contract or other instrument in respect of or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Mercury (other than a Mercury
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.11(a)_ ).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before the Mercury Approval Time,
the Mercury Board may effect a Mercury Adverse Recommendation Change if the
Mercury Board determines in its good faith business judgment, after consulting
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such withdrawal or
recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Mercury
Board's fiduciary duties to the Mercury Shareholders under applicable Law,
_provided_ , that (A) Mercury has provided Lares four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice advising Lares that it intends to take such action and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice shall not itself constitute a
Mercury Adverse Recommendation Change); (B) during such four (4) Business Day
period, to the extent requested by Lares, Mercury and its Representatives
engage in good faith negotiations with Lares and Lares' Representatives with
respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Lares as
would obviate the need for the Mercury Board to effect a Mercury Adverse
Recommendation Change and (C) after taking into consideration any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Lares by 5 p.m. Eastern
Time on the last day of such four (4) Business Day period, the Mercury Board
continues to believe in its good faith business judgment, after consulting
with outside legal counsel that the failure to make a Mercury Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
Mercury Board's fiduciary duties to the Mercury Shareholders under applicable
Law.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall prohibit the Mercury Board from
taking and disclosing to Mercury's shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its shareholders required
pursuant to applicable Law if the Mercury Board determines, in its good faith
business judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties or applicable Law.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Mercury shall promptly advise Lares orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof and all material
modifications thereto) that is made or submitted by any Person during the
period beginning on the date hereof until the Second Merger Effective Time or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If
Mercury receives an Acquisition Proposal or any request for discussions or
negotiations that could reasonably be expected to be related to an Acquisition
Proposal, it shall (i) promptly notify Lares (within no more than 24 hours
after any director, officer or financial advisor of Mercury is notified or
becomes aware of the receipt thereof)) of the communication or receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any request for discussions or negotiations that
could reasonably be expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal or request and the material terms and conditions
thereof, and (ii) keep Lares reasonably informed on a current basis of any
material developments in the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal
or request (including whether such Acquisition Proposal or request has been
withdrawn or rejected and any material change to the terms thereof).

 



 

(e) Mercury shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions existing as of the date of this Agreement with any Person that
relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in respect of
Mercury proposed prior to the date hereof. Mercury acknowledges and agrees
that any actions taken by or at the direction of a Representative of Mercury
or any of its Subsidiaries that, if taken by Mercury, would constitute a
breach or violation of this _Section 6.11_ will be deemed to constitute a
breach and violation of this _Section 6.11_ by Mercury.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Lares shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its and

reasonably requested by Mercury, including:

 



 

(i) (a) assisting in preparation for and participation, upon

Subsidiaries or their respective securities (in each case in accordance with
customary syndication practices) and (B) customary materials for rating agency
presentations;

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) delivering to Mercury and New Holdco and their potential financing

Financing, including any information necessary in order to prepare pro forma
financial information; provided that none of Lares, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their Representatives shall be responsible in any manner for
information relating to the proposed debt and equity capitalization that is
required for such pro forma financial information;

 



 

(iv) causing its independent registered public accounting firm to
cooperate with Mercury and New Holdco in connection with the Transaction
Financing, including by providing customary "comfort letters" (including

diligence activities of Mercury and the financing sources, and customary

(b) Lares hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries'
logos in connection with the Transaction Financing, provided that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage Lares or the Lares Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of Lares or any Lares Subsidiary. Notwithstanding any other provision
set forth herein or in any other agreement between Lares and Mercury (or their
respective affiliates), Lares agrees that Mercury and its affiliates may share
customary projections with respect to Lares and its business, which are
approved for distribution by Lares, with their potential financing sources and
other prospective lenders in connection with any marketing efforts in
connection with the Transaction Financing, provided that the recipients of
such information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Lares, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective directors or officers or
other personnel shall be required by this _Section 6.12_ (i) to take any

remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages) to (a) enforcement of any provision of this Agreement by a
decree or order of specific performance and (b) a temporary, preliminary
and/or permanent injunction to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any

parties hereto further agree that they shall not object to the granting of
injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis that there exists an
adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties hereby expressly further waives
(a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be adequate or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equity relief.
Each party agrees that its initial choice of remedy will be to seek specific
performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

avoidance of doubt, the covenants contained in _Section 6.6_.

the other Transaction Documents, all claims, obligations, Liabilities, or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or
by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made by the parties hereto only against (and such
representations and warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are
expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "
_Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including
any current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, or assignee of any
Contracting Party, or any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, or
assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_

equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations,
or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than as
set forth in the other Transaction Documents), and, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such
Liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates of another Contracting Party. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law (other than as set forth in
the other Transaction Documents), (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may
otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or
disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose Liability
of a Contracting Party on any other Contracting Party's Nonparty Affiliate in
respect of this Agreement, whether granted by statute or based on theories of
equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single
business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or
otherwise; and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any
other Contracting Party's Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance
of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.

 _(1) Preferred Shares_ 

 



 

(a) The Board of Directors is authorized, without shareholder action, to
classify or reclassify any or all of the unissued Preferred Shares from time
to time in one or more series and to provide for the designation, preferences,
limitations and relative rights of the shares of each series by the adoption
of Articles of Amendment to these Articles of Incorporation setting forth:

 



 

(i) The maximum number of shares in the series and the designation of the
series, which designation shall distinguish the shares thereof from the shares
of any other series or class;

 



 

(ii) Whether shares of the series shall have special, conditional or limited
voting rights, or no right to vote, except to the extent prohibited by law;

 



 

(iii) Whether shares of the series are redeemable or convertible (x) at the
option of the Corporation, a shareholder or another person or upon the
occurrence of a designated event, (y) for cash, indebtedness, securities or
other property, and (z) in a designated amount or in an amount determined in
accordance with a designated formula or by reference to extrinsic data or

 

events;

 



 

(iv) Any right of holders of shares of the series to distributions, calculated
in any manner, including the rate or rates of dividends, and whether dividends
shall be cumulative, noncumulative or partially cumulative;

 



 

 



   



 

(v) The amount payable to holders of shares of the series in the event of
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Corporation;

 



 

(vi) Any preference of the shares of the series over the shares of any other
series or class with respect to distributions, including dividends, and with
respect to distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the affairs of the Corporation; and

 



 

(vii) Any other preferences, limitations or specified rights (including a
right that no transaction of a specified nature shall be consummated while any
shares of such series remain outstanding except upon the assent of all or a
specified portion of such shares) now or hereafter permitted by the Virginia
Stock Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may be amended
from time to time, the " _VSCA_ ").

 



 

(b) Before the issuance of any shares of a series of Preferred Shares,
Articles of Amendment establishing such series shall be filed with and made
effective by the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, as required by the
VSCA.

 



 

(c) Each series of Preferred Shares shall be so designated as to distinguish
the shares thereof from the shares of all other series. Different series of
Preferred Shares shall not be considered to constitute different voting groups
of shares for the purpose of voting by voting groups except as required by the
VSCA or as otherwise specified by the Board of Directors with respect to any
series at the time of the establishment thereof.

 



 

 _(2) Common Shares._ 

 

 _ _

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Amendment establishing any
series of Preferred Shares, the holders of outstanding Voting Common Shares
shall, to the exclusion of the holders of any other class of shares of the
Corporation, have the sole power to vote for the election of directors and for
all other purposes without limitation. Notwithstanding any provision in the
VSCA to the contrary, the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall not
have any voting power with respect to the election of directors, the adoption
of any amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the authorization of any
plan of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or the authorization of
any disposition of assets or dissolution or for any other purpose, and shall
not have the right to participate in any meeting of shareholders, except as
may be required by the VSCA. In the event that the approval of the holders of
the Voting Common Shares shall be required by the VSCA for the adoption of an
amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the authorization of any plan
of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or the authorization of any
disposition of assets or dissolution, then, unless the Board of Directors
requires a greater vote, such approval shall require a majority of all votes
cast in respect thereof by holders of the Voting Common Shares, in lieu of
such vote as would otherwise be required by the VSCA at a meeting at which a
quorum of the Voting Common Shares exists.

 



 

(b) Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in these Articles, in all
other respects, including, but not by way of limitation, the right to receive
the payment of cash dividends, the right to share in the property or business
of the Corporation in event of its liquidation in whole or in part, and the
right to share in the assets of the Corporation in event of its dissolution
and the distribution of such assets by way of return of capital, each Voting
Common Share and each Non-Voting Common Share shall rank equally and be
identical.

 



 

 



   



 

 _(3) Other Rights._

 



 

(a) The holders of the Voting Common Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares shall
be treated equally, according to the number of Voting Common Shares or Non-
Voting Common Shares they hold, as applicable, in the payment of any share
dividend or other distribution of shares, but the holders of the Voting Common
Shares shall be issued only Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of
Voting Common Shares in the payment of any such share dividend or
distribution, while the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall be
issued only Non-Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of Non-Voting
Common Stock in the payment of any such share dividend or other distribution
of shares.

 



 

(b) No holder of shares of any class of the Corporation shall, as such holder,
have any right to subscribe for or purchase (i) any shares of any class of the
Corporation, or any warrants, options or other instruments that shall confer
upon the holder thereof the right to subscribe for or purchase or receive from
the Corporation any shares of any class, whether or not such shares, warrants,
options or other instruments are issued for cash or services or property or by
way of dividend or otherwise, or (ii) any other security of the Corporation
that shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, any shares of the
Corporation of any class or classes, or to which shall be attached or
appurtenant any warrant, option or other instrument that shall confer upon the
holder of such security the right to subscribe for or purchase or receive from
the Corporation any shares of any class or classes, whether or not such
securities are issued for cash or services or property or by way of dividend
or otherwise, other than such right, if any, as the Board of Directors, in its
sole discretion, may from time to time determine. If the Board of Directors
shall offer to the holders of shares of any class of the Corporation, or any
of them, any such shares, options, warrants, instruments or other securities
of the Corporation, such offer shall not, in any way, constitute a waiver or
release of the right of the Board of Directors subsequently to dispose of
other securities of the Corporation without offering the same to said holders.

 



 

(c) (i) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article III,
each Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one fully
paid and nonassessable Non-Voting Common Share; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such conversion shall not be permitted if, following and after giving effect
to such conversion, no Voting Common Shares would remain issued and
outstanding.

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article III, each
Non-Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one fully
paid and nonassessable Voting Common Share.

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) To effect a conversion of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares permitted by this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, a holder of
Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares shall deliver to the transfer
agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common Shares, as the
case may be, the certificate or certificates representing the Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares to be converted, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed proper instruments of conversion and transfer,
or, in the case of shares held in book-entry form, deliver written notice to
the transfer agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common
Shares, as the case may be, with a copy to the Secretary of the Corporation at
its principal corporate office, stating that such holder elects to convert
such shares and stating the name or names of the person or persons in which
the shares issued upon such conversion are to be issued (and setting forth the
addresses of such persons), together with proper instruments of conversion and
transfer in accordance with the procedures of the transfer agent and The
Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary (" _DTC_ "), as
applicable. Subject to Article III, conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected at the time and date when the conversion is reflected in the books of
the transfer agent following compliance with the requirements described in the
immediately preceding sentence, as applicable, with respect to the shares to
be converted, and the person exercising such conversion (or, if the notice
specifies another person to whom shares are to be issued upon conversion, such
other person) shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the class and
number of shares issuable upon such conversion at such time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if any such conversion should require the prior approval
from the Federal Communications Commission or any successor governmental
agency (the " _FCC_ "), such approval shall have been received prior to any
such conversion; and _provided further_ , that, if, as a result of such
requested conversion, the holder seeking conversion or any holder of Voting
Common Shares would acquire or be deemed to hold an interest subject to FCC
media ownership and qualifications reporting requirements (including without
limitation an "attributable interest" in the Corporation within the meaning of
Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined)), the conversion shall
not become effective until the Corporation shall have requested and received,
pursuant to Section B of Article III, information sufficient in the
Corporation's reasonable judgment to determine whether to exercise its rights
under Section C of Article III with respect to the conversion and the
Corporation in its reasonable judgment shall have determined not to exercise
such rights. If a requested conversion would cause any holder other than the
converting holder (" _Other Holder_ ") to acquire or be deemed to hold an
attributable interest in the Corporation under the Federal Communications
Laws, the Corporation shall have the discretion to convert shares of Voting
Common Shares held by such Other Holders to Non-Voting Common Shares but only
to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that such Other Holders will
remain non-attributable in the Corporation, _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
each such Other Holder will be given prior written notice indicating the
number of shares of such Other Holder's Voting Common Shares that the
Corporation proposes to convert to Non-Voting Common Shares, (2) each such
Other Holder will be given a reasonable opportunity to make a showing that
such Other Holder may hold an attributable interest in the Corporation
consistent with the Federal Communications Laws, (3) at the request of any
such Other Holder, the proposed conversion to Non-Voting Common Shares shall
not be made with respect to such Other Holder if the showing required in the
preceding clause (2) is made to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation
and (4) the Corporation shall have no other authority in the circumstances set
forth in this subsection (c) to alter the Voting Common Stock holdings of any
such Other Holder without such Other Holder's prior written consent. As
promptly as practicable following any holder's conversion of Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares as aforesaid, the Corporation shall (1) in
the case of conversions of certificated Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, issue and deliver to the converting holder, or to such holder's
transferee, as the case may be, one or more certificates (as such holder may
request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
issuable upon such conversion and if the certificates surrendered by the
converting holder evidence more Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares than the holder has elected to convert, one or more certificates (as
such holder may request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, which have not been converted and (2) in the
case of conversions of book-entry Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares, cause the transfer agent to effect (directly or through DTC) a book-
entry deposit of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issuable
upon such conversion to the converting holder, or to such holder's transferee,
as the case may be. Subject to Article III, in the case of certificated Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares, after the conversion is reflected
in the books of the transfer agent and pending the issuance and delivery of
such certificates, the certificate or certificates evidencing the Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares that have been surrendered for
conversion shall be deemed to evidence the Non-Voting Common Shares or Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, issuable upon such conversion. Any dividends
declared and not paid on Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
prior to their conversion as provided above shall be paid, on the payment
date, to the holder or holders entitled thereto on the record date for such
dividend payment notwithstanding such conversion, and no holder of Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issued upon a conversion occurring
after a record date for a declared and unpaid dividend shall be entitled to
receive any payment of such dividend with respect to such Voting Common Shares
or Non-Voting Common Shares, as applicable. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Voting Common
Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares, solely for the purpose of effecting the
conversions provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, such
number of Voting Common Shares and such number of Non-Voting Common Shares,
respectively, as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect any
conversion provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II and shall
take all such corporate action as may be necessary to assure that such Voting
Common Shares and such Non-Voting Common Shares shall be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable upon such conversion.

 



 

 



   



 

C. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders of the
Corporation may be called solely by the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
the President of the Corporation or the Board of Directors.

 



 

D. _Control Share Acquisitions._ The provisions of Article 14.1 of
the VSCA shall not apply to acquisitions of shares of any class of capital
stock of the Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

A. _Restrictions on Stock Ownership or Transfer._ As contemplated
by this Article III, the Corporation may restrict the ownership, conversion,
or proposed ownership, of shares of the Corporation by any person if such
ownership, conversion or proposed ownership, either alone or in combination
with other actual or proposed ownership (including due to conversion) of
shares of capital stock of any other person, would give rise to an FCC
Regulatory Limitation (as hereinafter defined). Ownership, conversion, or
proposed ownership shall be deemed to give rise to an " _FCC Regulatory
Limitation_ " if it (1) is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any
provision of the Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined), (2)
materially limits or impairs or could reasonably be expected to materially
limit or impair any existing business activity or proposed business activity
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries under the Federal Communications
Laws, (3) materially limits or impairs under the Federal Communications Laws
the acquisition of an attributable interest in a full-power television station
or a full-power radio station by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
for which the Corporation or its subsidiary has entered into a definitive
agreement with a third party, (4) subjects or could reasonably be expected to
subject the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to any rule, regulation,
order or policy under the Federal Communications Laws having or which could
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation to which the Corporation or any subsidiary of
the Corporation would not be subject but for such ownership, conversion or
proposed ownership, or (5) requires prior approval from the FCC and such
approval has not been obtained. For purposes of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III, the term " _Federal Communications Laws_ "
shall mean any law administered or enforced by the FCC, including, without
limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications
Act_ "), and the rules, regulations, orders and policies of the FCC. The
Corporation may, but is not required to, take any action permitted under this
Article III; and the grant of specific powers to the Corporation under this
Article III shall not be deemed to restrict the Corporation from pursuing,
alternatively or concurrently, any other remedy or alternative course of
action available to the Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

B. _Requests for Information_. If the Corporation believes that
the ownership or proposed ownership of shares of the Corporation by any person
(whether by reason of a change in such person's ownership, a change in the
number of shares outstanding overall or in any class, or for any other reason)
may give rise to an FCC Regulatory Limitation or subject the Corporation to
FCC reporting requirements, such person shall furnish promptly to the
Corporation such information (including, without limitation, information with
respect to its citizenship, ownership structure, and other ownership interests
and affiliations) as the Corporation shall reasonably request.

 



 

C. _Denial of Rights, Refusal to Transfer_. (1) If (a) any person
from whom information is requested pursuant to Section B of this Article III
does not provide all the information requested by the Corporation completely
and accurately in a timely manner or (b) the Corporation shall conclude that a
person's ownership, conversion, or proposed ownership of, or that a person's
exercise of any rights of ownership with respect to, shares of the
Corporation, either alone or in combination with other existing or proposed
ownership of shares of any other person, would give rise to an FCC Regulatory
Limitation, then in the case of either clause (a) or any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation may (A) refuse to permit the
transfer to such proposed share owner or conversion by such person of shares
of the Corporation, (B) suspend those rights of share ownership the exercise
of which causes or could cause any situation described in any provision of
clause (b) of this Section C(1) to occur, (C) require the conversion of any or
all shares held by such holder into shares of any other class of shares in the
Corporation with equivalent economic value (it being understood that for such
purposes a Voting Common Share and a Non-Voting Common Share are deemed to
have an equivalent economic value), (D) require the exchange of any or all
shares held by such holder for warrants to acquire, at a nominal exercise
price, the same number and class of shares of the Corporation, (E) condition
the acquisition (including due to conversion) of such shares on the prior
consent of the FCC, to the extent such consent is required, (F) to the extent
that the remedies in the foregoing clauses (A) through (E) are not reasonably
feasible, redeem any or all such shares of the Corporation held by such holder
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section C(2) of this
Article III, and/or (G) exercise any and all appropriate remedies, at law or
in equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, against any such holder or
proposed holder, with a view towards obtaining such information or preventing
or curing any situation described in clause (a) or in any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
reasonably feasible without materially adversely affecting the ability of the
Corporation to prevent or cure the situation described in clause (a) and/or
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation shall use its good faith efforts (x)
to cause any of the remedies listed in the preceding clauses (A) through (G)
to be imposed in a substantially similar manner when imposed on similarly
situated persons or stockholders at substantially the same time and (y) to
minimize the impact of the exercise of any such remedy on the interests in the
Corporation of the subject holders or persons or other shareholders of the
Corporation or other persons with an interest in the Corporation, subject in
all cases to the primary goal of preventing or curing any situation described
in clause (a) or any provision of clause (b) of this Section C(1); _provided_
, _further_ , that in the circumstances set forth in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II, the only remedy available to the Corporation with respect to Other
Holders will be the remedy set forth therein. Any such refusal of transfer or
suspension of rights pursuant to clause (A) or (B) of the immediately
preceding sentence shall remain in effect until the requested information has
been received and the Corporation has determined that such transfer, or the
exercise of such suspended rights, as the case may be, will not result in any
of the situations described in clause (b) of this Section C(1).

 



 

 



   



 

(2) Without limiting the foregoing, the terms and conditions of redemption
pursuant to Section C (1)(F) of this Article III shall be as follows:

 



 

(a) the redemption price of any shares of the Corporation to be redeemed
pursuant to Section C(1)(F) of this Article III shall be equal to the Fair
Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of such shares;

 



 

(b) the redemption price of such shares will be paid in cash;

 



 

(c) if less than all such shares are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed
shall be selected in such manner as shall be determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith, which may include selection first of the most
recently purchased shares thereof, selection by lot or selection in any other
manner determined by the Board of Directors in good faith;

 



 

(d) at least 15 days' prior written notice of the Redemption Date (as
hereinafter defined) shall be given to the record holders of the shares
selected to be redeemed (unless waived in writing by any such holder);
_provided_ _that_ the Redemption Date shall be the date on which written
notice shall be given to record holders if the cash necessary to effect the
redemption shall have been indefeasibly deposited in trust for the benefit of
such record holders and is then subject to immediate payment to them upon
surrender of the share certificates or compliance with DTC policies and
procedures for the redemption of book-entry securities for their redeemed
shares;

 



 

 



   



 

(e) from and after the Redemption Date, any and all rights of whatever
nature in respect of the shares selected for redemption (including, without
limitation, any rights to vote or participate in dividends declared on shares
(including declared and unpaid dividends) of the same class or series as such
shares), shall cease and terminate and the holders of such shares shall
thenceforth be entitled only to receive the cash payable upon redemption; and

 



 

(f) such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors shall
determine in good faith.

 



 

(3) For purposes of this Section C:

 



 

(a) " _Fair Market Value_ " shall mean, with respect to a share of the
Corporation of any class or series, the volume weighted average sales price
for such a share on the national securities exchange (if any) on which such
capital stock is then listed during the 20 most recent days on which shares of
stock of such class or series shall have been traded preceding the day on
which notice of redemption shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this
Article III; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such shares are not traded on
any national securities exchange, Fair Market Value shall mean the average of
the reported bid and asked prices in any over-the-counter quotation system
selected by the Corporation during the 20 most recent days during which such
shares were traded immediately preceding the day on which notice of redemption
shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, or if trading
of such shares is not reported in any over-the-counter quotation system, Fair
Market Value shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Non-Voting Common Share shall be deemed to
have a Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Voting Common
Share determined in accordance with the foregoing sentence.

 



 

(b) " _person_ " shall mean an individual, a corporation, a general or limited
partnership, an association, a limited liability company, a governmental
entity, a trust or other entity or organization.

 



 

(c) " _Redemption Date_ " shall mean the date fixed by the Board of Directors
for the redemption of any shares of the Corporation pursuant to or on the date
specified in Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, as the case may be.

 



 

(4) The Corporation shall instruct the Corporation's transfer agent that the
shares of the Corporation are subject to the restrictions set forth in this
Article III and such restrictions shall be noted conspicuously on the
certificate or certificates representing such shares or, in the case of
uncertificated securities, contained in the notice or notices sent as required
by law or pursuant to the policies and procedures of DTC in the case of book-
entry securities.

 



 

D. _Authority of Board of Directors_. In the case of an ambiguity
in the application of any of the provisions of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article
II or this Article III, including any definition used herein, the Board of
Directors shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions
with respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or
knowledge of the circumstances. In the event Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article
II or this Article III permits any action by the Corporation but fails to
provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine whether to take any action and the action to
be taken (if any) so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of
Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III. All such actions,
calculations, interpretations and determinations which are done or made by the
Board of Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the
Corporation and all other persons for all other purposes of Section
B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and this Article III. The Board of Directors may
delegate all or any portion of its powers under Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III to a committee of the Board of Directors as it
deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA,
may exercise the authority granted by Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and
this Article III through duly authorized officers or agents of the
Corporation. Nothing in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III
shall be construed to limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise
of its fiduciary duties under the VSCA.

 



 

 



   



 

E. _Reliance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA, the
Corporation and the members of the Board of Directors shall be fully protected
in relying in good faith upon any information provided by any person pursuant
to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III (including, without
limitation, Section B of this Article III) and the information, opinions,
reports or statements prepared or presented by (1) one or more officers or
employees of the Corporation whom the Director believes, in good faith, to be
reliable and competent in the matters presented, (2) legal counsel, public
accountants, or other persons as to matters the Director believes, in good
faith, are within the person\'s professional or expert competence, or (3) a
committee of the Board of Directors of which he is not a member if the
Director believes, in good faith, that the committee merits confidence. The
members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any good faith
errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence
and identity of, and the amount of any shares of the Corporation owned by any
holder, the Corporation is entitled to rely on the existence or absence of
filings of Schedule 13D or 13G or Form 13F under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (or similar filings), as of any date, subject to its
actual knowledge of the ownership of shares of the Corporation.

 



 

F. _Severability_. If any provision of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II or this Article III or the application of any such provision to any
person under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or Article III or the application of such
provision to any other person.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 A. _Chief Executive Officer_. During the three (3) year period
(the " _Post-Merger Period_ ") beginning at the Second Merger Effective Time,
the Chief Executive Officer shall be the most senior officer of the
Corporation and shall also hold the title of President. Effective as of the
Second Merger Effective Time, the Chief Executive Officer and President shall
be Vincent L. Sadusky unless another person is selected prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.4(e) of the Merger Agreement (the
" _Post-Merger CEO_ "). For so long as Vincent L. Sadusky is the Post-Merger
CEO during the Post-Merger Period, he shall not be removed from office without
Cause and his employment in such capacity shall not be terminated without
Cause except, in either case, as follows:

 



 

 



   



 

1. by a vote of a majority of the Directors then serving on the Board of Directors that includes the affirmative vote of at least one Lares Designee; or 

 



 

2. if there is no Lares Designee on the Board of Directors at such time, by the vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Directors then serving on the Board of Directors.

 



 

B. _Definitions_. For purposes of this Article IV and Article VI:

 



 

(1) " _Cause_ " shall mean "Cause" as that term is defined in Section 8(a)
of that certain Employment Agreement, entered into on March 21, 2014, by and
among Media General, Inc., a Virginia corporation, LIN Media LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, LIN Television Corporation, a Delaware corporation
and Vincent L. Sadusky.

 



 

(2) " _Merger Agreement_ " means the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of March 21, 2014, by and between Media General, Inc., Mercury New Holdco,
Inc., Mercury Merger Sub 1, Inc., Mercury Merger Sub 2, LLC and LIN Media LLC.

 



 

(3) " _Second Merger Effective Time_ " has the meaning given to such term
in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(4) " _Lares Designee_ " means (a) a Director designated as a Lares
Designee pursuant to Section 1.4(a) of the Merger Agreement (an " _Initial
Lares Designee_ "), (b) any Director who fills a vacancy created by the death,
resignation, removal, or failure to be elected by the shareholders of an
Initial Lares Designee and who was designated in writing as a Lares Designee
by the Lares Designees in office at the time such vacancy is filled, and (c)
any Director who fills a vacancy created by the death, resignation, removal,
or failure to be elected by the shareholders of a Lares Designee, who became
such in accordance with clause (b), and who was designated in writing as a
Lares Designee by the Lares Designees in office at the time such vacancy is
filled.

 



 

ARTICLE V

 



 

 A. Every reference in this Article V to a Director or Officer
shall include every Director or Officer or former Director or Officer of the
Corporation and every person who served at the request of the Corporation or
one of its subsidiaries as a Director, Officer, partner or trustee of any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, and, in all of such cases, his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. In addition, in this Article V, the terms "applicant",
"expenses", "liability", "party", and "proceeding" shall have the respective
meanings set forth in Section 13.1-696 of the VSCA.

 



 

B. In any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation
or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the Corporation, no Director or
Officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages with respect to any transaction, occurrence
or course of conduct, whether prior or subsequent to the effective date of
this Article V, except for liability resulting from such person's having
engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or
any federal or state securities law.

 



 

 



   



 

C. The Corporation shall indemnify (a) any person who was or is a
party to any proceeding, including a proceeding brought by a shareholder in
the right of the Corporation or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the
Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or
Officer of the Corporation, or (b) any Director or Officer who is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, trustee, partner or
Officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability incurred by him in
connection with such proceeding unless he or she engaged in willful misconduct
or a knowing violation of the criminal law. A person is considered to be
serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation's request if his duties to
the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him
to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. The Board of
Directors is hereby empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested
Directors, to enter into a contract to indemnify any Director or Officer in
respect of any proceedings arising from any act or omission, whether occurring
before or after the execution of such contract.

 



 

D. The provisions of this Article V shall be applicable to all
proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof by the shareholders of the
Corporation, arising from any act or omission, whether occurring before or
after such adoption. No amendment or repeal of this Article V shall have any
effect on the rights provided under this Article V with respect to any act or
omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. The Corporation shall
promptly take all such actions, and make all such determinations, as shall be
necessary or appropriate to comply with its obligation to provide any
indemnity under this Article V and shall promptly pay or reimburse all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such Director
or Officer in connection with such actions and determinations or proceedings
of any kind arising therefrom.

 



 

E. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent,
shall not of itself create a presumption that the applicant did not meet the
standard of conduct described in Section B or C of this Article V.

 



 

F. Any indemnification under Section C of this Article V (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the applicant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in Section C of this Article V.

 



 

The determination shall be made:

 



 

(1) if there are two or more disinterested directors, by the Board of
Directors by a majority vote of disinterested directors, a majority of whom
shall constitute a quorum, or by a majority of the members of a committee of
two or more disinterested directors appointed by such a vote;

 



 

 



   



 

(2) by special legal counsel:

 



 

(a) selected by the Board of Directors or its committee in the manner
prescribed in Section F(1) of this Article V; or

 



 

(b) if there are fewer than two disinterested directors, selected by the Board
of Directors, in which selection Directors who do not qualify as disinterested
directors may participate; or

 



 

(3) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of a
Director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested director may not
be voted on the determination.

 



 

Any evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same
manner as the determination that indemnification is appropriate, except that
if the determination is made by special legal counsel, such evaluation as to
reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under Section F(2)
of this Article V to select counsel.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there has been a change in the
composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the
alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification is claimed, any
determination as to indemnification and advancement of expenses with respect
to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to this Article V shall be made
by special legal counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the
applicant. If the Board of Directors and the applicant are unable to agree
upon such special legal counsel the Board of Directors and the applicant each
shall select a nominee, and the nominees shall select such special legal
counsel. If the nominees are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel,
such special legal counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

G. (1) The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable
expenses incurred by any applicant who is a party to a proceeding in advance
of final disposition of the proceeding or the making of any determination
under Section C of this Article V if the applicant furnishes the Corporation:

 



 

(a) a written statement of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met
the standard of conduct described in Section C of this Article V; and

 



 

(b) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to
repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet
such standard of conduct.

 



 

(2) The undertaking required by Section G(1)(b) of this Article V shall be an
unlimited general obligation of the applicant but need not be secured and may
be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

 



 

(3) Authorizations of payments under this section shall be made by the persons
specified in Section F of this Article V.

 



 

H. The Corporation may indemnify or contract to indemnify any
person not specified in Section B or C of this Article V who was, is or may
become a party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom
indemnification is granted in Section C of this Article V.

 



 

 



   



 

I. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to
indemnify it against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it
in accordance with this Article V and may also procure insurance, in such
amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, on behalf of any person who
is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against or
incurred by him in any such capacity or arising from his or her status as
such, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against
such liability under the provisions of this Article V.

 



 

J. The indemnification hereby provided and provided hereafter
pursuant to the power hereby conferred by this Article V on the Board of
Directors shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person may
be entitled, including any right under policies of insurance that may be
purchased and maintained by the Corporation or others, with respect to claims,
issues or matters in relation to which the Corporation would not have the
power to indemnify such person under the provisions of this Article V. Such
rights shall not prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation to make or
provide for any further indemnity, or provisions for determining entitlement
to indemnity, pursuant to one or more indemnification agreements, bylaws, or
other arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or
security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the
Board of Directors (whether or not any of the Directors of the Corporation
shall be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, bylaws or
arrangements); _provided, however_ , that any provision of such agreements,
bylaws or other arrangements shall not be effective if and to the extent that
it is determined to be contrary to this Article V or applicable laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.

 



 

K. Each provision of this Article V shall be severable, and an
adverse determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the
validity of any other provision.

 



 

ARTICLE VI

 



 

The Corporation shall have all of the powers of a corporation incorporated
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, except that the Corporation's
power to remove or terminate the employment of Vincent L. Sadusky without
Cause during the Post-Merger Period shall be limited as set forth in Article
IV.

Article I 
Meetings of Shareholders

 



 



 

Section 1. _Place of Meetings_. Meetings of Shareholders shall be held at
the principal office of the Corporation in Richmond, Virginia or at such other
place, either within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia, as from time to
time may be fixed by the Board of Directors. The Board may, in its sole
discretion, permit Shareholders to participate in any meeting of Shareholders
by means of remote communication as authorized by the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may be amended from
time to time, the " _VSCA_ ") and subject to any guidelines and procedures as
may be adopted by the Board.

 



 

Section 2. _Annual Meetings_. The Annual Meetings of Shareholders shall
be held on a date fixed by the Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 3. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Shareholders may
be called solely by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board of
Directors. At a special meeting of Shareholders, no business shall be
transacted and no corporate action taken other than that stated in the notice
of the special meeting.

 



 

Section 4. _Notice of Meetings_. Written notice stating the place, day
and hour of the meeting and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten nor
more than 60 days before the date of the meeting (except as a different time
is specified in these Bylaws or by the VSCA) either personally or by mail, by
or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman, the
Secretary, or the Officer or persons calling the meeting, to each Shareholder
of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be
deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the
Shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the
Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. Without limiting the manner by
which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Shareholders, any notice to
a Shareholder given by the Corporation may be given by a form of electronic
transmission consented to by the Shareholder to whom the notice is given. Any
such consent shall be revocable by the Shareholder by written or electronic
notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked (a) if the
Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive
notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such
inability becomes known to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the
giving of notice, _provided, however_ , the inadvertent failure to treat such
inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
For purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form or
process of communication, not directly involving the physical transfer of
paper or other tangible medium that (i) is suitable for the retention,
retrieval and reproduction of information by the recipient, and (ii) is either
(A) retrievable in paper form by the recipient through an automated process
used in conventional commercial practice or (B) retrievable in perceivable
form and the sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of
such form of electronic transmission.

 



 

 

  



 

Notice of a Shareholders' meeting to act on an amendment of the Articles of
Incorporation, on a plan of merger or exchange of shares, on a sale of assets
of the Corporation that requires shareholder approval, a plan of
redomestication or conversion or the dissolution of the Corporation shall be
given, in the manner provided above, not less than 25 nor more than 60 days
before the date of the meeting. Any such notice shall be accompanied, as
appropriate, by such additional documents as may be required by law.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a written waiver of notice signed by the person
or persons entitled to such notice, either before or after the time stated
therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. A Shareholder who
attends a meeting shall be deemed to have (A) waived objection to lack of
notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless at the beginning of the
meeting he or she objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at
the meeting, and (B) waived objection to consideration of a particular matter
at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the
meeting notice, unless he or she objects to considering the matter when it is
presented.

 



 

Section 5. _Quorum_. A majority of the shares entitled to vote,
represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of
Shareholders; _provided however,_ that when any specified action is required
to be voted upon by a class of stock voting as a class or series, holders of a
majority of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of such specified action. If a quorum is present, action on a
matter is approved if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes
cast opposing the action, except when a larger vote or a vote by class or
series is required by the VSCA and except that in elections of Directors those
receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected even though not
receiving a majority. Less than a quorum may adjourn, without notice other
than by announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall attend.

 



 

Section 6. _Organization and Order of Business_. At all meetings of the
Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board or, in the Chairman's absence, the
Vice Chairman (if any), the President (if one shall have been elected by the
Board) or, in the absence of all of the foregoing, the most senior Executive
Vice President, shall act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of all of
the foregoing officers or, if present, with their consent, a majority of the
shares entitled to vote at such meeting, may appoint any person to act as
chairman. The Secretary of the Corporation or, in the Secretary's absence, an
Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary at all meetings of the
Shareholders. In the event that neither the Secretary nor any Assistant
Secretary is present, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to
act as secretary of the meeting.

 



 

The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as
are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including,
without limitation, the establishment of procedures for the dismissal of
business not properly presented, the maintenance of order and safety,
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of
the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time
prescribed for the commencement thereof, the opening and closing of the voting
polls and any recess or adjournment of the meeting.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 7. _Voting_. A Shareholder may vote his or her shares in person
or by proxy. Any proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of the meeting at
or prior to the time designated by the chairman of the meeting or in the order
of business for so delivering such proxies. No proxy shall be valid after
eleven months from its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Each
holder of record of stock of any class or series shall, as to all matters in
respect of which stock of such class or series has voting power, be entitled
to such vote as is provided in the Articles of Incorporation for each share of
stock of such class or series standing in the holder's name on the books of
the Corporation. Unless required by the VSCA or determined by the chairman of
the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be by ballot.

be signed by the President or a Vice President and the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary or any other Officer authorized by a resolution of the
Board of Directors. Transfer agents and/or registrars for one or more classes
of the stock of the Company may be appointed by the Board and may be required
to countersign certificates representing stock of such class or classes.
Certificates may, but need not, be sealed with the seal of the Corporation or
a facsimile thereof. The signatures of the Officers upon such certificates may
be facsimiles if the certificate is countersigned by a Transfer Agent or
registered by a Registrar other than the Corporation itself or an employee of
the Corporation. In the event that any officer, transfer agent or registrar
whose signature or facsimile thereof shall have been used on a stock
certificate shall for any reason cease to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar of the Corporation before such certificate is issued, such
certificate may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such
person was such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issuance.
Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated
shares of the Corporation, the Corporation shall send, or cause to be sent, to
the holder a written statement that shall include the information required by
the VSCA to be set forth on certificates for shares of capital stock.

 



 

In case any Officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been
placed upon a stock certificate shall have ceased to be such Officer before
such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he were such Officer at the date of its issue.

 



 

Section 2. _Transfer Agents and Registrars_. Transfer Agents and/or
Registrars for the stock of the Corporation may be appointed by the Board of
Directors and may be required to countersign stock certificates.

 



 

Section 3. _Lost, Destroyed and Mutilated Certificates_. Holders of the
stock of the Corporation shall immediately notify the Corporation of any loss,
destruction or mutilation of the certificate therefor, and the Board of
Directors may in its discretion, or any Officer of the Corporation appointed
by the Board of Directors for that purpose may in his discretion, cause one or
more new certificates for the same number of shares in the aggregate to be
issued to such Shareholder upon the surrender of the mutilated certificate or
upon satisfactory proof of such loss or destruction and the deposit of a bond
in such form and amount and with such surety as the Board of Directors may
require.

 



 

Section 4. _Transfer of Stock_. The stock of the Corporation shall be
transferable or assignable only on the books of the Corporation by the holders
in person or by attorney, and in the case of shares of stock of the
Corporation represented by certificates, on surrender of the certificates for
such shares duly endorsed and, if sought to be transferred by attorney,
accompanied by a written power of attorney to have the same transferred on the
books of the Corporation. Uncertificated shares shall be transferable or
assignable only on the books of the Corporation upon proper instruction from
the holder of such shares. The Corporation will recognize the right of the
person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and
to vote as such owner.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5. _Closing of Transfer Books and Fixing Record Date_. For the
purposes of determining Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive
payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of Shareholders
for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of this Corporation may
fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of
Shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than 70 days prior to the
date on which the particular action requiring such determination of
Shareholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination
of Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders,
or Shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which
the notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the
Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be,
shall be the record date for such determination of Shareholders. When a
determination of Shareholders has been made as provided in this section with
respect to any meeting, such determination shall apply to any adjournment
thereof.

 _(1) Preferred Shares_ 

 



 

(a) The Board of Directors is authorized, without shareholder action, to
classify or reclassify any or all of the unissued Preferred Shares from time
to time in one or more series and to provide for the designation, preferences,
limitations and relative rights of the shares of each series by the adoption
of Articles of Amendment to these Articles of Incorporation setting forth:

 



 

(i) The maximum number of shares in the series and the designation of the
series, which designation shall distinguish the shares thereof from the shares
of any other series or class;

 



 

(ii) Whether shares of the series shall have special, conditional or limited
voting rights, or no right to vote, except to the extent prohibited by law;

 



 

(iii) Whether shares of the series are redeemable or convertible (x) at the
option of the Corporation, a shareholder or another person or upon the
occurrence of a designated event, (y) for cash, indebtedness, securities or
other property, and (z) in a designated amount or in an amount determined in
accordance with a designated formula or by reference to extrinsic data or

 

events;

 



 

(iv) Any right of holders of shares of the series to distributions, calculated
in any manner, including the rate or rates of dividends, and whether dividends
shall be cumulative, noncumulative or partially cumulative;

 



 

 

  



 

(v) The amount payable to holders of shares of the series in the event of
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Corporation;

 



 

(vi) Any preference of the shares of the series over the shares of any other
series or class with respect to distributions, including dividends, and with
respect to distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the affairs of the Corporation; and

 



 

(vii) Any other preferences, limitations or specified rights (including a
right that no transaction of a specified nature shall be consummated while any
shares of such series remain outstanding except upon the assent of all or a
specified portion of such shares) now or hereafter permitted by the Virginia
Stock Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may be amended
from time to time, the " _VSCA_ ").

 



 

(b) Before the issuance of any shares of a series of Preferred Shares,
Articles of Amendment establishing such series shall be filed with and made
effective by the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, as required by the
VSCA.

 



 

(c) Each series of Preferred Shares shall be so designated as to distinguish
the shares thereof from the shares of all other series. Different series of
Preferred Shares shall not be considered to constitute different voting groups
of shares for the purpose of voting by voting groups except as required by the
VSCA or as otherwise specified by the Board of Directors with respect to any
series at the time of the establishment thereof.

 



 

 _(2) Common Shares._ 

 

 _ _

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Amendment establishing any
series of Preferred Shares, the holders of outstanding Voting Common Shares
shall, to the exclusion of the holders of any other class of shares of the
Corporation, have the sole power to vote for the election of directors and for
all other purposes without limitation. Notwithstanding any provision in the
VSCA to the contrary, the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall not
have any voting power with respect to the election of directors, the adoption
of any amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the authorization of any
plan of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or the authorization of
any disposition of assets or dissolution or for any other purpose, and shall
not have the right to participate in any meeting of shareholders, except as
may be required by the VSCA. In the event that the approval of the holders of
the Voting Common Shares shall be required by the VSCA for the adoption of an
amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the authorization of any plan
of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or the authorization of any
disposition of assets or dissolution, then, unless the Board of Directors
requires a greater vote, such approval shall require a majority of all votes
cast in respect thereof by holders of the Voting Common Shares, in lieu of
such vote as would otherwise be required by the VSCA at a meeting at which a
quorum of the Voting Common Shares exists.

 



 

(b) Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in these Articles, in all
other respects, including, but not by way of limitation, the right to receive
the payment of cash dividends, the right to share in the property or business
of the Corporation in event of its liquidation in whole or in part, and the
right to share in the assets of the Corporation in event of its dissolution
and the distribution of such assets by way of return of capital, each Voting
Common Share and each Non-Voting Common Share shall rank equally and be
identical.

 



 

 



   



 

 _(3) Other Rights._

 



 

(a) The holders of the Voting Common Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares shall
be treated equally, according to the number of Voting Common Shares or Non-
Voting Common Shares they hold, as applicable, in the payment of any share
dividend or other distribution of shares, but the holders of the Voting Common
Shares shall be issued only Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of
Voting Common Shares in the payment of any such share dividend or
distribution, while the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall be
issued only Non-Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of Non-Voting
Common Stock in the payment of any such share dividend or other distribution
of shares.

 



 

(b) No holder of shares of any class of the Corporation shall, as such holder,
have any right to subscribe for or purchase (i) any shares of any class of the
Corporation, or any warrants, options or other instruments that shall confer
upon the holder thereof the right to subscribe for or purchase or receive from
the Corporation any shares of any class, whether or not such shares, warrants,
options or other instruments are issued for cash or services or property or by
way of dividend or otherwise, or (ii) any other security of the Corporation
that shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, any shares of the
Corporation of any class or classes, or to which shall be attached or
appurtenant any warrant, option or other instrument that shall confer upon the
holder of such security the right to subscribe for or purchase or receive from
the Corporation any shares of any class or classes, whether or not such
securities are issued for cash or services or property or by way of dividend
or otherwise, other than such right, if any, as the Board of Directors, in its
sole discretion, may from time to time determine. If the Board of Directors
shall offer to the holders of shares of any class of the Corporation, or any
of them, any such shares, options, warrants, instruments or other securities
of the Corporation, such offer shall not, in any way, constitute a waiver or
release of the right of the Board of Directors subsequently to dispose of
other securities of the Corporation without offering the same to said holders.

 



 

(c) (i) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article III,
each Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one fully
paid and nonassessable Non-Voting Common Share; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such conversion shall not be permitted if, following and after giving effect
to such conversion, no Voting Common Shares would remain issued and
outstanding.

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article III, each
Non-Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one fully
paid and nonassessable Voting Common Share.

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) To effect a conversion of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares permitted by this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, a holder of
Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares shall deliver to the transfer
agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common Shares, as the
case may be, the certificate or certificates representing the Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares to be converted, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed proper instruments of conversion and transfer,
or, in the case of shares held in book-entry form, deliver written notice to
the transfer agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common
Shares, as the case may be, with a copy to the Secretary of the Corporation at
its principal corporate office, stating that such holder elects to convert
such shares and stating the name or names of the person or persons in which
the shares issued upon such conversion are to be issued (and setting forth the
addresses of such persons), together with proper instruments of conversion and
transfer in accordance with the procedures of the transfer agent and The
Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary (" _DTC_ "), as
applicable. Subject to Article III, conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected at the time and date when the conversion is reflected in the books of
the transfer agent following compliance with the requirements described in the
immediately preceding sentence, as applicable, with respect to the shares to
be converted, and the person exercising such conversion (or, if the notice
specifies another person to whom shares are to be issued upon conversion, such
other person) shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the class and
number of shares issuable upon such conversion at such time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if any such conversion should require the prior approval
from the Federal Communications Commission or any successor governmental
agency (the " _FCC_ "), such approval shall have been received prior to any
such conversion; and _provided further_ , that, if, as a result of such
requested conversion, the holder seeking conversion or any holder of Voting
Common Shares would acquire or be deemed to hold an interest subject to FCC
media ownership and qualifications reporting requirements (including without
limitation an "attributable interest" in the Corporation within the meaning of
Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined)), the conversion shall
not become effective until the Corporation shall have requested and received,
pursuant to Section B of Article III, information sufficient in the
Corporation's reasonable judgment to determine whether to exercise its rights
under Section C of Article III with respect to the conversion and the
Corporation in its reasonable judgment shall have determined not to exercise
such rights. If a requested conversion would cause any holder other than the
converting holder (" _Other Holder_ ") to acquire or be deemed to hold an
attributable interest in the Corporation under the Federal Communications
Laws, the Corporation shall have the discretion to convert shares of Voting
Common Shares held by such Other Holders to Non-Voting Common Shares but only
to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that such Other Holders will
remain non-attributable in the Corporation, _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
each such Other Holder will be given prior written notice indicating the
number of shares of such Other Holder's Voting Common Shares that the
Corporation proposes to convert to Non-Voting Common Shares, (2) each such
Other Holder will be given a reasonable opportunity to make a showing that
such Other Holder may hold an attributable interest in the Corporation
consistent with the Federal Communications Laws, (3) at the request of any
such Other Holder, the proposed conversion to Non-Voting Common Shares shall
not be made with respect to such Other Holder if the showing required in the
preceding clause (2) is made to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation
and (4) the Corporation shall have no other authority in the circumstances set
forth in this subsection (c) to alter the Voting Common Stock holdings of any
such Other Holder without such Other Holder's prior written consent. As
promptly as practicable following any holder's conversion of Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares as aforesaid, the Corporation shall (1) in
the case of conversions of certificated Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, issue and deliver to the converting holder, or to such holder's
transferee, as the case may be, one or more certificates (as such holder may
request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
issuable upon such conversion and if the certificates surrendered by the
converting holder evidence more Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares than the holder has elected to convert, one or more certificates (as
such holder may request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, which have not been converted and (2) in the
case of conversions of book-entry Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares, cause the transfer agent to effect (directly or through DTC) a book-
entry deposit of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issuable
upon such conversion to the converting holder, or to such holder's transferee,
as the case may be. Subject to Article III, in the case of certificated Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares, after the conversion is reflected
in the books of the transfer agent and pending the issuance and delivery of
such certificates, the certificate or certificates evidencing the Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares that have been surrendered for
conversion shall be deemed to evidence the Non-Voting Common Shares or Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, issuable upon such conversion. Any dividends
declared and not paid on Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
prior to their conversion as provided above shall be paid, on the payment
date, to the holder or holders entitled thereto on the record date for such
dividend payment notwithstanding such conversion, and no holder of Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issued upon a conversion occurring
after a record date for a declared and unpaid dividend shall be entitled to
receive any payment of such dividend with respect to such Voting Common Shares
or Non-Voting Common Shares, as applicable. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Voting Common
Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares, solely for the purpose of effecting the
conversions provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, such
number of Voting Common Shares and such number of Non-Voting Common Shares,
respectively, as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect any
conversion provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II and shall
take all such corporate action as may be necessary to assure that such Voting
Common Shares and such Non-Voting Common Shares shall be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable upon such conversion.

 



 

 



   



 

C. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders of the
Corporation may be called solely by the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
the President of the Corporation or the Board of Directors.

 



 

D. _Control Share Acquisitions._ The provisions of Article 14.1 of
the VSCA shall not apply to acquisitions of shares of any class of capital
stock of the Company.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

A. _Restrictions on Stock Ownership or Transfer._ As contemplated
by this Article III, the Corporation may restrict the ownership, conversion,
or proposed ownership, of shares of the Corporation by any person if such
ownership, conversion or proposed ownership, either alone or in combination
with other actual or proposed ownership (including due to conversion) of
shares of capital stock of any other person, would give rise to an FCC
Regulatory Limitation (as hereinafter defined). Ownership, conversion, or
proposed ownership shall be deemed to give rise to an " _FCC Regulatory
Limitation_ " if it (1) is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any
provision of the Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined), (2)
materially limits or impairs or could reasonably be expected to materially
limit or impair any existing business activity or proposed business activity
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries under the Federal Communications
Laws, (3) materially limits or impairs under the Federal Communications Laws
the acquisition of an attributable interest in a full-power television station
or a full-power radio station by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
for which the Corporation or its subsidiary has entered into a definitive
agreement with a third party, (4) subjects or could reasonably be expected to
subject the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to any rule, regulation,
order or policy under the Federal Communications Laws having or which could
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation to which the Corporation or any subsidiary of
the Corporation would not be subject but for such ownership, conversion or
proposed ownership, or (5) requires prior approval from the FCC and such
approval has not been obtained. For purposes of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III, the term " _Federal Communications Laws_ "
shall mean any law administered or enforced by the FCC, including, without
limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications
Act_ "), and the rules, regulations, orders and policies of the FCC. The
Corporation may, but is not required to, take any action permitted under this
Article III; and the grant of specific powers to the Corporation under this
Article III shall not be deemed to restrict the Corporation from pursuing,
alternatively or concurrently, any other remedy or alternative course of
action available to the Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

B. _Requests for Information_. If the Corporation believes that
the ownership or proposed ownership of shares of the Corporation by any person
(whether by reason of a change in such person's ownership, a change in the
number of shares outstanding overall or in any class, or for any other reason)
may give rise to an FCC Regulatory Limitation or subject the Corporation to
FCC reporting requirements, such person shall furnish promptly to the
Corporation such information (including, without limitation, information with
respect to its citizenship, ownership structure, and other ownership interests
and affiliations) as the Corporation shall reasonably request.

 



 

C. _Denial of Rights, Refusal to Transfer_. (1) If (a) any person
from whom information is requested pursuant to Section B of this Article III
does not provide all the information requested by the Corporation completely
and accurately in a timely manner or (b) the Corporation shall conclude that a
person's ownership, conversion, or proposed ownership of, or that a person's
exercise of any rights of ownership with respect to, shares of the
Corporation, either alone or in combination with other existing or proposed
ownership of shares of any other person, would give rise to an FCC Regulatory
Limitation, then in the case of either clause (a) or any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation may (A) refuse to permit the
transfer to such proposed share owner or conversion by such person of shares
of the Corporation, (B) suspend those rights of share ownership the exercise
of which causes or could cause any situation described in any provision of
clause (b) of this Section C(1) to occur, (C) require the conversion of any or
all shares held by such holder into shares of any other class of shares in the
Corporation with equivalent economic value (it being understood that for such
purposes a Voting Common Share and a Non-Voting Common Share are deemed to
have an equivalent economic value), (D) require the exchange of any or all
shares held by such holder for warrants to acquire, at a nominal exercise
price, the same number and class of shares of the Corporation, (E) condition
the acquisition (including due to conversion) of such shares on the prior
consent of the FCC, to the extent such consent is required, (F) to the extent
that the remedies in the foregoing clauses (A) through (E) are not reasonably
feasible, redeem any or all such shares of the Corporation held by such holder
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section C(2) of this
Article III, and/or (G) exercise any and all appropriate remedies, at law or
in equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, against any such holder or
proposed holder, with a view towards obtaining such information or preventing
or curing any situation described in clause (a) or in any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
reasonably feasible without materially adversely affecting the ability of the
Corporation to prevent or cure the situation described in clause (a) and/or
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation shall use its good faith efforts (x)
to cause any of the remedies listed in the preceding clauses (A) through (G)
to be imposed in a substantially similar manner when imposed on similarly
situated persons or stockholders at substantially the same time and (y) to
minimize the impact of the exercise of any such remedy on the interests in the
Corporation of the subject holders or persons or other shareholders of the
Corporation or other persons with an interest in the Corporation, subject in
all cases to the primary goal of preventing or curing any situation described
in clause (a) or any provision of clause (b) of this Section C(1); _provided_
, _further_ , that in the circumstances set forth in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II, the only remedy available to the Corporation with respect to Other
Holders will be the remedy set forth therein. Any such refusal of transfer or
suspension of rights pursuant to clause (A) or (B) of the immediately
preceding sentence shall remain in effect until the requested information has
been received and the Corporation has determined that such transfer, or the
exercise of such suspended rights, as the case may be, will not result in any
of the situations described in clause (b) of this Section C(1).

 

 



   



 

(2) Without limiting the foregoing, the terms and conditions of redemption
pursuant to Section C (1)(F) of this Article III shall be as follows:

 



 

(a) the redemption price of any shares of the Corporation to be redeemed
pursuant to Section C(1)(F) of this Article III shall be equal to the Fair
Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of such shares;

 



 

(b) the redemption price of such shares will be paid in cash;

 



 

(c) if less than all such shares are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed
shall be selected in such manner as shall be determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith, which may include selection first of the most
recently purchased shares thereof, selection by lot or selection in any other
manner determined by the Board of Directors in good faith;

 



 

(d) at least 15 days' prior written notice of the Redemption Date (as
hereinafter defined) shall be given to the record holders of the shares
selected to be redeemed (unless waived in writing by any such holder);
_provided_ _that_ the Redemption Date shall be the date on which written
notice shall be given to record holders if the cash necessary to effect the
redemption shall have been indefeasibly deposited in trust for the benefit of
such record holders and is then subject to immediate payment to them upon
surrender of the share certificates or compliance with DTC policies and
procedures for the redemption of book-entry securities for their redeemed
shares;

 



 

 



   



 

(e) from and after the Redemption Date, any and all rights of whatever
nature in respect of the shares selected for redemption (including, without
limitation, any rights to vote or participate in dividends declared on shares
(including declared and unpaid dividends) of the same class or series as such
shares), shall cease and terminate and the holders of such shares shall
thenceforth be entitled only to receive the cash payable upon redemption; and

 



 

(f) such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors shall
determine in good faith.

 



 

(3) For purposes of this Section C:

 



 

(a) " _Fair Market Value_ " shall mean, with respect to a share of the
Corporation of any class or series, the volume weighted average sales price
for such a share on the national securities exchange (if any) on which such
capital stock is then listed during the 20 most recent days on which shares of
stock of such class or series shall have been traded preceding the day on
which notice of redemption shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this
Article III; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such shares are not traded on
any national securities exchange, Fair Market Value shall mean the average of
the reported bid and asked prices in any over-the-counter quotation system
selected by the Corporation during the 20 most recent days during which such
shares were traded immediately preceding the day on which notice of redemption
shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, or if trading
of such shares is not reported in any over-the-counter quotation system, Fair
Market Value shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Non-Voting Common Share shall be deemed to
have a Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Voting Common
Share determined in accordance with the foregoing sentence.

 



 

(b) " _person_ " shall mean an individual, a corporation, a general or limited
partnership, an association, a limited liability company, a governmental
entity, a trust or other entity or organization.

 



 

(c) " _Redemption Date_ " shall mean the date fixed by the Board of Directors
for the redemption of any shares of the Corporation pursuant to or on the date
specified in Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, as the case may be.

 



 

(4) The Corporation shall instruct the Corporation's transfer agent that the
shares of the Corporation are subject to the restrictions set forth in this
Article III and such restrictions shall be noted conspicuously on the
certificate or certificates representing such shares or, in the case of
uncertificated securities, contained in the notice or notices sent as required
by law or pursuant to the policies and procedures of DTC in the case of book-

D. _Authority of Board of Directors_. In the case of an ambiguity
in the application of any of the provisions of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article
II or this Article III, including any definition used herein, the Board of
Directors shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions
with respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or
knowledge of the circumstances. In the event Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article
II or this Article III permits any action by the Corporation but fails to
provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine whether to take any action and the action to
be taken (if any) so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of
Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III. All such actions,
calculations, interpretations and determinations which are done or made by the
Board of Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the
Corporation and all other persons for all other purposes of Section
B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and this Article III. The Board of Directors may
delegate all or any portion of its powers under Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III to a committee of the Board of Directors as it
deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA,
may exercise the authority granted by Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and
this Article III through duly authorized officers or agents of the
Corporation. Nothing in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III
shall be construed to limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise
of its fiduciary duties under the VSCA.

 



 

 



   



 

E. _Reliance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA, the
Corporation and the members of the Board of Directors shall be fully protected
in relying in good faith upon any information provided by any person pursuant
to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III (including, without
limitation, Section B of this Article III) and the information, opinions,
reports or statements prepared or presented by (1) one or more officers or
employees of the Corporation whom the Director believes, in good faith, to be
reliable and competent in the matters presented, (2) legal counsel, public
accountants, or other persons as to matters the director believes, in good
faith, are within the person\'s professional or expert competence, or (3) a
committee of the Board of Directors of which he is not a member if the
Director believes, in good faith, that the committee merits confidence. The
members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any good faith
errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence
and identity of, and the amount of any shares of the Corporation owned by any
holder, the Corporation is entitled to rely on the existence or absence of
filings of Schedule 13D or 13G or Form 13F under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (or similar filings), as of any date, subject to its
actual knowledge of the ownership of shares of the Corporation.

 



 

F. _Severability_. If any provision of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II or this Article III or the application of any such provision to any
person under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or Article III or the application of such
provision to any other person.

ARTICLE V

 



 

 A. Every reference in this Article V to a Director or Officer
shall include every Director or Officer or former Director or Officer of the
Corporation and every person who served at the request of the Corporation or
one of its subsidiaries as a Director, Officer, partner or trustee of any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, and, in all of such cases, his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. In addition, in this Article V, the terms "applicant",
"expenses", "liability", "party", and "proceeding" shall have the respective
meanings set forth in Section 13.1-696 of the VSCA.

 



 

B. In any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation
or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the Corporation, no Director or
Officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages with respect to any transaction, occurrence
or course of conduct, whether prior or subsequent to the effective date of
this Article V, except for liability resulting from such person's having
engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or
any federal or state securities law.

 



 

 



   



 

C. The Corporation shall indemnify (a) any person who was or is a
party to any proceeding, including a proceeding brought by a shareholder in
the right of the Corporation or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the
Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or
Officer of the Corporation, or (b) any Director or Officer who is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, trustee, partner or
Officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability incurred by him in
connection with such proceeding unless he or she engaged in willful misconduct
or a knowing violation of the criminal law. A person is considered to be
serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation's request if his duties to
the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him
to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. The Board of
Directors is hereby empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested
Directors, to enter into a contract to indemnify any Director or Officer in
respect of any proceedings arising from any act or omission, whether occurring
before or after the execution of such contract.

 



 

D. The provisions of this Article V shall be applicable to all
proceedings commenced after the adoption hereof by the shareholders of the
Corporation, arising from any act or omission, whether occurring before or
after such adoption. No amendment or repeal of this Article V shall have any
effect on the rights provided under this Article V with respect to any act or
omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. The Corporation shall
promptly take all such actions, and make all such determinations, as shall be
necessary or appropriate to comply with its obligation to provide any
indemnity under this Article V and shall promptly pay or reimburse all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such Director
or Officer in connection with such actions and determinations or proceedings
of any kind arising therefrom.

 



 

E. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent,
shall not of itself create a presumption that the applicant did not meet the
standard of conduct described in Section B or C of this Article V.

 



 

F. Any indemnification under Section C of this Article V (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the applicant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in Section C of this Article V.

 



 

The determination shall be made:

 



 

(1) if there are two or more disinterested directors, by the Board of
Directors by a majority vote of disinterested directors, a majority of whom
shall constitute a quorum, or by a majority of the members of a committee of
two or more disinterested directors appointed by such a vote;

 



 

 



   



 

(2) by special legal counsel:

 



 

(a) selected by the Board of Directors or its committee in the manner
prescribed in Section F(1) of this Article V; or

 



 

(b) if there are fewer than two disinterested directors, selected by the Board
of Directors, in which selection Directors who do not qualify as disinterested
directors may participate; or

 



 

(3) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of a
Director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested director may not
be voted on the determination.

 



 

Any evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same
manner as the determination that indemnification is appropriate, except that
if the determination is made by special legal counsel, such evaluation as to
reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under Section F(2)
of this Article V to select counsel.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there has been a change in the
composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the
alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification is claimed, any
determination as to indemnification and advancement of expenses with respect
to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to this Article V shall be made
by special legal counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the
applicant. If the Board of Directors and the applicant are unable to agree
upon such special legal counsel the Board of Directors and the applicant each
shall select a nominee, and the nominees shall select such special legal
counsel. If the nominees are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel,
such special legal counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

G. (1) The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable
expenses incurred by any applicant who is a party to a proceeding in advance
of final disposition of the proceeding or the making of any determination
under Section C of this Article V if the applicant furnishes the Corporation:

 



 

(a) a written statement of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met
the standard of conduct described in Section C of this Article V; and

 



 

(b) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to
repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet
such standard of conduct.

 



 

(2) The undertaking required by Section G(1)(b) of this Article V shall be an
unlimited general obligation of the applicant but need not be secured and may
be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

 



 

(3) Authorizations of payments under this section shall be made by the persons
specified in Section F of this Article V.

 



 

H. The Corporation may indemnify or contract to indemnify any
person not specified in Section B or C of this Article V who was, is or may
become a party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom
indemnification is granted in Section C of this Article V.

 



 

 



   



 

I. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to
indemnify it against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it
in accordance with this Article V and may also procure insurance, in such
amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, on behalf of any person who
is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against or
incurred by him in any such capacity or arising from his or her status as
such, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against
such liability under the provisions of this Article V.

 



 

J. The indemnification hereby provided and provided hereafter
pursuant to the power hereby conferred by this Article V on the Board of
Directors shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person may
be entitled, including any right under policies of insurance that may be
purchased and maintained by the Corporation or others, with respect to claims,
issues or matters in relation to which the Corporation would not have the
power to indemnify such person under the provisions of this Article V. Such
rights shall not prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation to make or
provide for any further indemnity, or provisions for determining entitlement
to indemnity, pursuant to one or more indemnification agreements, bylaws, or
other arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or
security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the
Board of Directors (whether or not any of the Directors of the Corporation
shall be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, bylaws or
arrangements); _provided, however_ , that any provision of such agreements,
bylaws or other arrangements shall not be effective if and to the extent that
it is determined to be contrary to this Article V or applicable laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.

 



 

K. Each provision of this Article V shall be severable, and an
adverse determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the
validity of any other provision.

 



 

ARTICLE VI

 



 

The Corporation shall have all of the powers of a corporation incorporated
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, except that the Corporation's
power to remove or terminate the employment of Vincent L. Sadusky without
Cause during the Post-Merger Period shall be limited as set forth in Article
IV.
