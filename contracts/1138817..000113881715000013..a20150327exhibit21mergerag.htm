AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is dated as of March 25, 2015 (this
"Agreement"), by and between Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc., a Georgia
corporation ("Atlantic Capital"), and First Security Group, Inc., a Tennessee
corporation ("FSGI"). Both Atlantic Capital and FSGI are referred to herein as
a "Party" and, together, as the "Parties."

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Atlantic Capital and FSGI have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transactions
provided for in this Agreement in which FSGI will, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Atlantic
Capital (the "Merger"), so that Atlantic Capital is the surviving corporation
in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving
Corporation");

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Atlantic Capital and FSGI (the "Atlantic
Capital Board" and the "FSGI Board," respectively) have unanimously adopted
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, the FSGI Board has resolved to recommend that the shareholders of
FSGI approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger;

WHEREAS, the Atlantic Capital Board has resolved to recommend that the
shareholders of Atlantic Capital approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, it is intended that, immediately following the Merger, or as soon as
practicable thereafter, Atlantic Capital Bank, a Georgia banking corporation
("Atlantic Capital Bank"), will be merged with and into FSGBank, National
Association, a national banking association ("FSGBank"), so that FSGBank is
the surviving bank ("Surviving Bank");

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and including the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"); and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

| 
---|--- 

1.1

|

The Merger. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the Tennessee Business Corporation Act ("TBCA") and the Georgia Business
Corporation Code (the "GBCC"), at the Effective Time FSGI shall merge with and
into Atlantic Capital. Atlantic Capital shall be 

the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Georgia. As of the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of FSGI shall cease.

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, Atlantic Capital Bank, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Atlantic Capital, will merge with and into FSGBank, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of FSGI (the "Bank Merger"), with FSGBank as the
surviving entity. As part of the Bank Merger, FSGBank shall change its name to
"Atlantic Capital Bank, National Association." The Parties agree that the Bank
Merger shall become effective immediately after the Effective Time. The Bank
Merger shall be implemented pursuant to a subsidiary plan of merger, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Subsidiary Plan of
Merger"), with such changes thereto as Atlantic Capital and FSGI may mutually
agree upon. In order to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the Bank
Merger, the parties hereto shall cause the following to be accomplished prior
to the filing of applications for such regulatory approvals: (i) Atlantic
Capital shall cause Atlantic Capital Bank to approve the Subsidiary Plan of
Merger; (ii) Atlantic Capital, as the sole shareholder of Atlantic Capital

Conversion of Shares. 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of FSGI, Atlantic Capital or the holder of any of the following
securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Atlantic Capital
(the "Atlantic Capital Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be
affected by the Merger.

(b) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of FSGI (the "FSGI
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are owned, directly or indirectly, by Atlantic Capital or FSGI (other
than shares of FSGI Common Stock held in trust accounts (including grantor or
rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties)
(any such shares, the "FSGI Cancelled Shares") shall no longer be outstanding,
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of
Atlantic Capital or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. 

(c) Subject to Section 1.4(e) and Article II, each share of FSGI Common Stock,
except for the FSGI Cancelled Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will cease to be outstanding and will be converted into
and exchanged for the right to receive the following:

(i) Cash in the amount of $2.35 per share (the "Per Share Cash
Consideration"); or

(ii) 0.188 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Atlantic Capital Common Stock (together, with any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Atlantic Capital Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.1, the "Per Share Stock Consideration"). The total cash
and stock consideration paid by Atlantic Capital in respect of FSGI Common
Stock in connection with the Merger is referred to herein as the "Merger
Consideration."

(d) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Atlantic Capital Common Stock or FSGI Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization,
appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to the Exchange Ratio
and Per Share Cash Consideration.

(e) Election and Allocation Procedures.

(i) Election. Subject to the limitations set forth below, each holder of FSGI
Common Stock shall be provided an opportunity, (i) to elect to receive
Atlantic Capital Common Stock with respect to all of such holder's FSGI Common
Stock (a "Stock Election"); (ii) to elect to receive cash with respect to all
of such holder's FSGI Common Stock (a "Cash Election"); (iii) to elect to
receive cash with respect to a portion of such holder's FSGI's Common Stock
and shares of Atlantic Capital Stock with respect to such holder's remaining
shares (a "Mixed Election"); or (iv) to indicate that such holder makes no
such election with respect to such holder's shares of FSGI Common Stock (a
"Non-Election"). Shares of FSGI Common Stock as to which a Cash Election has
been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein as
"Cash Election Shares." Shares of FSGI Common Stock as to which a Stock
Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred
to herein as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of FSGI Common Stock as to which
a Non-Election or no election has been made, including any FSGI Common Stock
issued in connection with the exercise of FSGI Stock Awards after the Election
Deadline, are referred to herein as "No-Election Shares."

(A) Atlantic Capital and FSGI shall cause to be mailed an election form and
other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent), in such form as Atlantic Capital and FSGI shall mutually
agree (the "Election Form") with or following the issuance of the Proxy
Statement (as hereinafter defined) to each holder of record of FSGI Common
Stock. Atlantic Capital and FSGI shall use all reasonable efforts to make
available as promptly as possible an Election Form to any shareholder of FSGI
who requests such Election Form following the initial mailing of the Election
Form and prior to the Election Deadline (as defined below). Each Election Form
shall permit a holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and
customary documentation and instruction) of FSGI Common Stock to make a Stock
Election, Cash Election, Mixed Election or Non-Election. Nominee record
holders who hold FSGI Common Stock on behalf of multiple 

beneficial owners shall indicate how many of such shares held by them are
Stock Election Shares, Cash Election Shares and No-Election Shares based upon
the actions of the beneficial owners thereof.

(B) Any shares of FSGI Common Stock with respect to which the holder shall not
have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective, properly completed,
Election Form prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the business day that is five
(5) business days prior to the Effective Time (or such other time and date as
Atlantic Capital and FSGI may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline") shall
be treated as No-Election Shares; provided, however, that the Election
Deadline may not occur after the Effective Time.



(C) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline, together with all required accompanying documentation and
duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form, all as
described in the instructions to the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form (or the
beneficial owner of the shares covered by such Election Form through
appropriate and customary documentation and instruction) at or prior to the
Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline and no other valid election is made, the shares of FSGI
Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall be No-Election Shares.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither
Atlantic Capital, FSGI nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to
notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

(ii) Allocation. As soon as practicable after the Election Deadline, Atlantic
Capital shall cause the Exchange Agent to allocate the Merger Consideration
among the holders of FSGI Common Stock that was issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of this
Section. In order to ensure that the limits specified with respect to the cash
consideration specified below are not exceeded, the parties hereby agree that
the Exchange Agent, in applying the allocation rules set forth herein, shall
have reasonable discretion to round calculations or otherwise adjust results
thereof in order to accomplish such purpose, and each good faith determination
made by the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and
conclusive.

(A) Cash Consideration Undersubscribed. If the number of Cash Election Shares
is less than or equal to 26,730,454 (the "Cash Election Threshold"), then, at
the Effective Time:

(I) each Cash Election Share will be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration;



(II) No-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares to the
extent necessary to have the total number of Cash Election Shares equal the
Cash Election Threshold. If less than all of the No-Election Shares are so
required to be treated as Cash Election Shares, then the Exchange Agent shall
convert, on a pro rata basis, a sufficient number of No-Election Shares into
Cash Election Shares, with all remaining No-Election Shares treated as Stock
Election Shares;



(III) If all of the No-Election Shares are converted to Cash Election Shares
under the preceding subsection and the total number of Cash Election Shares
remains below the Cash Election Threshold, then the Exchange Agent shall
convert, on a pro rata basis, a sufficient number of 

Stock Election Shares into Cash Election Shares (the "Reallocated Cash
Election Shares") such that the sum of the number of Cash Election Shares plus
the Reallocated Cash Election Shares equals the Cash Election Threshold and
each Reallocated Cash Election Share shall be converted in to the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and



(IV) each Stock Election Share which is not a Reallocated Cash Election Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.



(B) Cash Consideration Oversubscribed. If the number of Cash Election Shares
is greater than the Cash Election Threshold, then, at the Effective Time:

(I) each Stock Election Share and No-Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;



(II) the Exchange Agent shall convert, on a pro rata basis, a sufficient
number of Cash Election Shares into Stock Election Shares (the "Reallocated
Stock Election Shares") such that the number of remaining Cash Election Shares
does not exceed the Cash Election Threshold (provided that the Cash Election
Shares not subject to a Mixed Election shall be treated as Reallocated Stock
Election Shares only if the Cash Election Shares subject to a Mixed Election
are insufficient in number to reach the Cash Election Threshold and, provided
further, that holders of one hundred (100) or fewer shares of FSGI Common
Stock of record on the date of this Agreement who have elected solely the Cash
Election shall not be required to have any of their shares of FSGI Common
Stock converted to Reallocated Stock Election Shares) and all Reallocated
Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration; and



(III) each Cash Election Share which is not a Reallocated Stock Election Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.



1.5 Stock Options, Other Stock-Based Awards and Warrants.

(a) Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this Section 1.5 pertain to all
options and other stock-based awards granted by FSGI, including but not
limited to awards granted under FSGI's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the
Second Amended and Restated 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2002 Long-
Term Incentive Plan, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the "FSGI Stock Awards"), provided, however, that any
accelerated vesting performed pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall only be
performed if required by the terms of the FSGI Stock Awards as in effect on
the date hereof without any further action by FSGI.

(b) As of the Effective Time, Atlantic Capital shall either: (i) assume any
FSGI Stock Awards substantially in accordance with the terms of the FSGI Stock
Awards; or (ii) substitute the FSGI Stock Awards for substantially identical
awards under any Atlantic Capital Stock Plans or other plans to be adopted by
Atlantic Capital before the Effective Time, such that after the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of any FSGI Stock Awards, the
FSGI Stock Awards shall be converted into and become rights with respect to
Atlantic Capital Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time and after
giving effect to the foregoing assumption or substitution: (i) each FSGI Stock
Award assumed or substituted by Atlantic Capital may be exercised solely for
shares of Atlantic Capital Common Stock; (ii) the number of shares of Atlantic
Capital Common Stock subject to such FSGI Stock Award shall be equal to the
number of shares of FSGI Common Stock subject to such FSGI Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest 

whole share); and (iii) the per share exercise price under each such FSGI
Stock Award shall be adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent). It is intended that the foregoing assumption shall be
undertaken in a manner that will not constitute a "modification" as defined in
Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code, as to any stock option which is an
"incentive stock option." Atlantic Capital and FSGI agree to take all
necessary steps to effect the provisions of this Section 1.5.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, FSGI, the FSGI Board and the
compensation committee of the FSGI Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any FSGI or FSGBank
employee or other participant consents) that may be necessary to effectuate
the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 1.5.

the Code.

From and after the Effective Time, until determined otherwise by the Boards of

ARTICLE II 
DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

Exchange Procedures. 

(a) Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Atlantic
Capital shall appoint an exchange and paying agent reasonably acceptable to
FSGI (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment and exchange of the Merger
Consideration.

(b) Atlantic Capital to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Atlantic Capital shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of holders of shares of
FSGI Common Stock, certificates representing the shares of Atlantic Capital
Common Stock and an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
amount of cash 

payable pursuant to this Article II (including the estimated amount of cash to
be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Atlantic Capital Common Stock).

(c) Distributions to Holders of FSGI Common Stock. After completion of the
allocation referred to in Section 1.4(e), and upon the Effective Time, each
holder of an outstanding share of FSGI Common Stock who has properly
surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) will be entitled to evidence
of issuance in book entry form, or upon written request of such holder a
certificate or certificates representing, the number of whole shares of
Atlantic Capital Stock and/or the amount of cash in to which the aggregate
number of shares of FSGI Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. If a holder of FSGI Common Stock surrenders such
Certificates representing shares of FSGI Common Stock (the "Certificates") or
non-certificated shares of FSGI Common Stock represented by book-entry
registry (the "Book Entry Shares") and a properly executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent at least five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time, then Atlantic Capital shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, within one (1) business day
following the Effective Time, to such holder of FSGI Common Stock the
consideration into which the shares of such FSGI Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. If a holder of FSGI Common Stock
surrenders such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly executed
letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent at any time after at least five
(5) business days prior to the Effective Time, then Atlantic Capital shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to promptly, but
in no event later than five (5) business days following receipt of such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of
transmittal, deliver to such holder of FSGI Common Stock the consideration
into which the shares of such FSGI Common Stock have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of FSGI Common Stock is entitled as a
result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his or her Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 2.1. The
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be, as applicable, duly
endorsed or accompanied with such transfer and other documentation as the
Exchange Agent may require. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to a holder of the FSGI Common Stock for any amounts paid or
property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property law.

(d) Letter of Transmittal. Atlantic Capital shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the Effective
Time, to mail to each holder Certificates and Book-Entry Shares who has not
previously surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with an Election
Form, a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, into which the shares of such FSGI Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no certificates representing fractional shares of Atlantic
Capital Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of the
FSGI Common Stock and such fractional Atlantic Capital Common Stock interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder
of the Surviving Corporation. Each holder of FSGI Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Atlantic Capital Common
Stock shall instead receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share of Atlantic Capital
Common 

Stock to which such holder (after taking into account all FSGI Common Stock
held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled, by (b)
$12.50.

(f) Lost Certificates. A holder of FSGI Common Stock whose Certificates have
been lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall be entitled to
receive its portion of the Merger Consideration and dividends or
distributions, and cash in lieu of fractional shares to which such shareholder
shall be entitled upon compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent pursuant to applicable law and as
required in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's standard policy
(including the requirement that the shareholder furnish an affidavit of lost
certificate, surety bond or other customary indemnity).

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

Rights of Former FSGI Shareholders. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of FSGI shall be closed as to holders of FSGI Common Stock, and no
transfer of FSGI Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or
recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.1 of this Agreement, each Book-Entry Share or Certificate
representing shares of FSGI Common Stock shall from and after the Effective
Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. To the extent
permitted by law, former holders of record of FSGI Common Stock shall be
entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Atlantic Capital
shareholders the number of whole shares of Atlantic Capital Common Stock into
which their respective shares of FSGI Common are converted, regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their certificates representing FSGI
Common Stock for certificates representing Atlantic Capital Common Stock in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Atlantic Capital on the Atlantic Capital Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution
payable to the holders of record of FSGI Common Stock as of any time
subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any Book-
Entry Share or Certificate representing shares of FSGI Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time until such holder surrenders such Book-Entry
Share or Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 2.1 of this
Agreement. However, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate
representing FSGI Common Stock shares of Atlantic Capital Common Stock,
together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without
interest, shall be delivered and paid with respect to each Book-Entry Share or
other share represented by such Certificate.

statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.6(b) of the Atlantic Capital Disclosure
Schedule, neither Atlantic Capital nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required under GAAP
to be set forth on a balance sheet or in the notes thereto, except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Atlantic Capital for the period ended December 31, 2013 (including

or otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing

committee thereof or to any director or officer of Atlantic Capital.

(d) Atlantic Capital and each of its Subsidiaries has established and
maintains a system of internal controls (as provided for in Section 36 of the

assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and financial
statements for regulatory reporting purposes, (ii) that receipts and
expenditures of Atlantic Capital and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the applicable board of
directors, and (iii) regarding prevention, or timely detection and correction
of, unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Atlantic Capital's and its
Subsidiaries' assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements of Atlantic Capital or such Subsidiaries.

(e) During the Atlantic Capital Reporting Period, Atlantic Capital's
"disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by Atlantic Capital in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to Atlantic Capital's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Atlantic Capital
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(f) During the Atlantic Capital Reporting Period, each of Atlantic Capital's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer (or each former
principal executive officer and each former principal financial officer, as
applicable) will make all certifications required by Rule 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect
to the Atlantic Capital SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such
certifications will be true and accurate in all material respects. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. During the Atlantic Capital Reporting Period, Atlantic
Capital will be in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(g) The information contained in the budget or the pro forma financial
information (including, without limitation, the most recent projections and
forecasts contained therein) that was provided by Atlantic Capital to FSGI was
based upon reasonable assumptions, and, to Atlantic Capital's Knowledge, such
assumptions and such budget or pro forma financial information remain

Atlantic Capital's Knowledge (except as set forth in written third-party
environmental reports included in the relevant loan documentation regarding
real property securing a Loan made in the ordinary course of business to a
third party that is not an affiliate of Atlantic Capital), any property in
which Atlantic Capital or any of its Subsidiaries holds a security interest,

Bank Secrecy Act; Patriot Act; Money Laundering. 

Neither Atlantic Capital nor any Atlantic Capital Subsidiary has any reason to

regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney or auditor representing FSGI or any

Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by FSGI or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the FSGI Board or any committee thereof or
to any director or officer of FSGI.

(d) FSGI and each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains a system
of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of FSGI and its Subsidiaries are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the FSGI
Board, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of FSGI's and its Subsidiaries' assets that
could have a material effect on FSGI's financial statements.

(e) FSGI's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all information
(both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by FSGI in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to FSGI's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of FSGI required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. FSGI has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures prior to the
date of this Agreement, to FSGI's auditors and the audit committee of the FSGI
Board and on Section 4.6(e) of the FSGI Disclosure Schedule (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that could adversely affect in any
material respect FSGI's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in FSGI's
internal controls over financial reporting.

(f) Each of FSGI's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
(or each former principal executive officer and each former principal
financial officer, as applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the FSGI SEC Reports, and the statements
contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all material
respects. FSGI is in compliance with all applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

(g) The information contained in the budget or the pro forma financial
information (including, without limitation, the most recent projections and
forecasts contained therein) that was provided by FSGI to Atlantic Capital,
was based upon reasonable assumptions, and, to FSGI's Knowledge, such
assumptions and such budget or pro forma financial information remain
reasonable as of the date hereof.

accelerated Tax as a result of Section 409A or a Tax imposed under Section
409A; and (iv) for any FSGI Benefit Plan that is not intended to be subject to

events) result in any payment or benefits (whether of severance pay or
otherwise) becoming due from FSGI, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any current, former or retired officer, employee,
director, consultant, independent contractor or other service provider of FSGI
or any Subsidiary thereof, (iii) that is a contract material to the business
of FSGI to be performed after the date of this Agreement, (iv) that materially
restricts the conduct of any line of business, or the area in which such
business is conducted, by FSGI or, to the Knowledge of FSGI, upon consummation
of the Merger will materially restrict the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to engage in any line of business in which a bank holding company
may lawfully engage, (v) with or to a labor union or guild (including any
collective bargaining agreement) or (vi) including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan, performance stock,
phantom or restricted stock units, stock purchase plan, employee stock
ownership plan or benefits plan in which any of the benefits of which will be
increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the
execution of this Agreement, the occurrence of any shareholder approval or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the
value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of or
affected by any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in
this Section 4.13(a), whether or not set forth in the FSGI Disclosure
Schedule, is referred to as a "FSGI 

Contract," and neither FSGI nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has

other parties thereto.

(b) (i) Each FSGI Contract is valid and binding on FSGI or its applicable
Subsidiary and is in full force and effect, (ii) FSGI and each of its
Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations required
to be performed by it to date under each FSGI Contract and (iii) no event or

Risk Management Instruments. 

All Derivative Transactions, whether entered into for the account of FSGI or
any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of FSGI or any of its
Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and in accordance with prudent banking practice and
applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Authority

management and other policies, practices and procedures employed by FSGI and
its Subsidiaries, and with counterparties believed at the time to be
financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in

Transactions. All of such Derivative Transactions are legal, valid and binding
obligations of FSGI or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in
accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity), and are in
full force and effect. FSGI and its Subsidiaries have duly performed their
obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such

Effect on FSGI, each of FSGI and its Subsidiaries has good title to all
securities and commodities owned by it (except those sold under repurchase
agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and clear of any
Liens, except to the extent such securities or commodities are pledged in the
ordinary course of business to secure obligations of FSGI or its Subsidiaries.

Loan Portfolio. 

(a) Section 4.16(a) of the FSGI Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of December
31, 2014 (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all loan
agreements, notes or borrowing arrangements (including leases, credit
enhancements, commitments, guarantees and interest-bearing assets) payable to
FSGI or its Subsidiaries (collectively, "FSGI Loans"), other than "nonaccrual"
FSGI Loans, (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
"nonaccrual" FSGI Loans, (iii) a summary of all FSGI Loans designated as of
such date by FSGI as "Special Mention", "Substandard", "Doubtful", "Loss" or
words of similar import by category of FSGI Loan (e.g., commercial, consumer,
etc.), together with the aggregate principal amount of such FSGI Loans by
category and the amount of specific reserves 

with respect to each such category of FSGI Loans and (iv) each asset of FSGI
or any of its Subsidiaries that is classified as "Other Real Estate Owned" and
the book value thereof.

(b) Each FSGI Loan (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of
indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the
extent secured, has been secured by valid liens and security interests that
have been perfected, (iii) where required by applicable law, has been based on
an appraisal and (iv) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general
principles of equity). All FSGI Loans originated by FSGI or its Subsidiaries,
and all such FSGI Loans purchased by FSGI or its Subsidiaries, were made or
purchased in accordance with customary lending standards. All such FSGI Loans
(and any related guarantees) and payments due thereunder are, and on the
Closing Date will be, free and clear of any Lien, and FSGI or its Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects, and on the Closing Date will have
complied in all material respects, with all laws and regulations relating to
such FSGI Loans.

(c) Since December 31, 2014, none of the FSGI Subsidiaries has incurred any
unusual or extraordinary loan losses that are material to FSGI and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; to FSGI's Knowledge and in light of each
of the FSGI Subsidiaries' historical loan loss experience and its management's
analysis of the quality and performance of its loan portfolio, the reserves
for loan losses shown on the balance sheets of FSGI for the year ended
December 31, 2014 were, as of such date, adequate in all respects under the
requirements of GAAP and applicable regulatory accounting practices, in each
case consistently applied, to provide for probable loan losses as of such
date, and were in accordance with the safety and soundness standards
administered by, and the practices, procedures, requests and requirements of,
the applicable FSGI Regulatory Agency.

of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business) (the "FSGI Owned

statutory Liens securing payments not yet due, (ii) Liens for real property
taxes not yet delinquent, (iii) easements, rights of way and other similar

all Liens of any nature whatsoever encumbering FSGI's or its Subsidiaries'
leasehold estate, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is in possession of
the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid
without default thereunder by FSGI or one of its Subsidiaries or, to FSGI's
Knowledge, the lessor. The FSGI Real Property is in material compliance with
all applicable zoning laws and building codes, and the buildings and
improvements located on the FSGI Real Property are in good operating condition
and in a state of good working order, ordinary wear and tear and casualty
excepted. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of FSGI, threatened

Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all applicable health and safety
related requirements for the 

FSGI Real Property, including those under the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 and the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970. FSGI currently

amounts, scope and coverage reasonably necessary for its operations. FSGI has

4.18

Insurance. 

FSGI and each of its Subsidiaries are insured with insurers against such risks
and in such amounts as constitute reasonably adequate coverage against all
risks customarily insured against by banking institutions and their
subsidiaries of comparable size and operations to FSGI and its Subsidiaries.
FSGI has a true and complete list of all insurance policies applicable and
available to FSGI and each of its Subsidiaries with respect to its business or
that are otherwise maintained by or for FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"FSGI Policies") and has provided true and complete copies of all such FSGI
Policies to Atlantic Capital. Except as set forth in Section 4.18 of the FSGI
Disclosure Schedule, there is no claim for coverage by FSGI or any of its
Subsidiaries pending under any of such FSGI Policies as to which coverage has
been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such FSGI Policies
or in respect of which such underwriters have reserved their rights. Each FSGI
Policy is in full force and effect and all premiums payable by FSGI or any of
its Subsidiaries have been timely paid, by FSGI or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable. To the Knowledge of FSGI, neither FSGI nor any of its Subsidiaries
have received written notice of any threatened termination of, material
premium increase with respect to, lapse of coverage under, or material
alteration of coverage under, any of such FSGI Policies. To the best of FSGI's

FSGI and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use (in each case,
free and clear of any Liens), all Intellectual Property used in or necessary
for the conduct of its business as currently conducted, and all license fees
in connection with FSGI's Intellectual Property have been paid. The use of any
Intellectual Property by FSGI and its Subsidiaries does not, to the Knowledge
of FSGI, infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any Person and is in
accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which FSGI or any
Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual Property. To FSGI's
Knowledge, no Person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any
right of FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual
Property owned by and/or licensed to FSGI or its Subsidiaries. Neither FSGI
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any pending
claim with respect to any Intellectual Property used by FSGI and its
Subsidiaries and, to FSGI's Knowledge, no Intellectual Property owned and/or
licensed by FSGI or its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner
that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such
Intellectual Property.

4.20

Environmental Liability. 

There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims,
actions, causes of action, orders, assessments (including penalty assessments)
or notices of any kind with respect to any environmental, health or safety
matters or any environmental, health or safety investigations, either ordered
by any Governmental Entity or conducted voluntarily, or remediation activities
of any nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in,
any material liability or obligation of FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries
arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental,
health or safety statute, regulation or ordinance, including the CERCLA that
are currently pending or, to 

FSGI's Knowledge, threatened against FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries. To the
Knowledge of FSGI, there is no reasonable basis for, or circumstances that are
reasonably likely to give rise to, any such proceeding, claim, action,
investigation or remediation by any Governmental Entity or any third party
that would give rise to any material liability or obligation on the part of
FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither FSGI nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or
with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or
obligation with respect to any of the foregoing. Each of FSGI and its
Subsidiaries, and, to FSGI's Knowledge (except as set forth in written third-
party environmental reports included in the relevant loan documentation
regarding real property securing a FSGI Loan made in the ordinary course of
business to a third party that is not an affiliate of FSGI), any property in
which FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries holds a security interest, is in
material compliance with all local, state or federal environmental, health or
safety laws, including CERCLA. Neither FSGI nor any of its Subsidiaries has
assumed by contract any liability for any environmental, health or safety
matters. Neither FSGI nor any of its Subsidiaries is an indemnitor in
connection with any threatened or pending claim by any third-party indemnitee
for any liability for any environmental, health or safety matters.

and effect. FSGI and each of its Subsidiaries has performed, in all material
respects, all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each

Privacy of Customer Information. 

FSGI is the sole owner or, in the case of participated loans, a co-owner with
the other participant(s), of all IIPI relating to customers, former customers
and prospective customers. For purposes of this Section 4.22, "IIPI" shall
include any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
person. Neither FSGI nor the FSGI Subsidiaries have any reason to believe that
any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause the collection and use of
such IIPI by FSGI and the use of such IIPI by FSGI as contemplated by this
Agreement not to comply with all applicable privacy policies, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and all other applicable state,
federal and foreign privacy laws, and any contract or industry standard
relating to privacy. In accordance with the requirements of the Gramm-Leach-

Subsidiaries will (i) maintain the security and confidentiality of customer
records and information; (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or
hazards to the security or integrity of such records; and (iii) protect

4.23

|

Bank Secrecy Act; Patriot Act; Money Laundering. 

Neither FSGI nor any FSGI Subsidiary has any reason to believe that any facts
or circumstances exist, which would cause FSGI or the FSGI Subsidiaries to be
deemed to be operating in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act,
any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering 

by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering law. Furthermore, the
Boards of Directors of FSGI and its Subsidiaries have adopted and implemented
an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate
customer identification verification procedures, that has not been deemed
ineffective by any Governmental Authority and that meets the requirements of
Sections 352 and 326 of the Patriot Act.

4.24

|

CRA Compliance. 

Neither FSGI nor any FSGI Subsidiary has received any notice of non-compliance
with the applicable provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. As of the date hereof, FSGI and each FSGI
Subsidiary's most recent examination rating under the CRA was "satisfactory"
or better. FSGI knows of no fact or circumstance or set of facts or
circumstances which would be reasonably likely to cause FSGI or any FSGI
Subsidiary to receive any notice of non-compliance with such provisions of the
CRA or cause the CRA rating of FSGI or any FSGI Subsidiary to decrease below
the "satisfactory" level.

4.26

|

Reorganization; Approvals. 

As of the date of this Agreement, FSGI (a) is not aware of any fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and (b) knows of no reason why all regulatory approvals from any
Governmental Entity required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement should not be obtained on a timely basis.

| 
---|--- 

4.27

|

Transactions with Affiliates. 

All "covered transactions" between FSGI and an "affiliate," within the meaning
of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations promulgated
thereunder, have been in compliance with such provisions.

4.28

|

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity. 

FSGI has developed and implemented a contingency planning program to evaluate
the impact of significant events that may adversely affect FSGI's customers,
assets, or employees. To the best of FSGI's Knowledge, such program ensures
that FSGI and its Subsidiaries can recover their mission critical functions
and complies with the requirements of the FFIEC, the SEC, and the FDIC.

The information relating to FSGI and its Subsidiaries that is provided by FSGI
or their representatives for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4,
or in any application, notification or other document filed with any other
FSGI Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity in connection with the

6.1

|

Regulatory Matters. 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, 

notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or
Governmental Entities. Atlantic Capital and FSGI shall have the right to
review in advance and each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the
information relating to Atlantic Capital and FSGI, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. Each Party shall consult with the other Party in advance of
any meeting, conference or communication with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other Party and/or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. The Parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to require any Party to take any action, or
commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in
connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of third parties or Governmental Entities, that the Parties
agree would have a Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to
Atlantic Capital) on either FSGI or Atlantic Capital (a "Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition").

(b) Each Party shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders, as
applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of FSGI, Atlantic Capital
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) Each Party shall promptly advise the other Party upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any FSGI Requisite Regulatory Approval or Atlantic Capital Requisite
Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval may be materially delayed or subject to a Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

6.2

Access to Information; Confidentiality. 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
confidentiality of information, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors, agents and other representatives of the other Party, reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period before the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and,
during such period, such Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
make available to the other Party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or documents that such
Party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other
information 

concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other Party may
reasonably request, including tax returns, supporting schedules and workpapers
maintained by FSGI's outside accountants. None of Atlantic Capital or FSGI or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of such Party or its Subsidiaries or contravene
any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into before the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its respective agents and
representatives to, maintain in confidence all information received from the
other Party (other than disclosure to that Party's agents and representatives
in connection with the evaluation and consummation of the Merger) in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger (including the existence and
terms of this Agreement) and use such information solely to evaluate the
Merger, unless (i) such information is already known to the receiving Party or
its agents and representatives, (ii) such information is subsequently
disclosed to the receiving Party or its agents and representatives by a third
party that, to the Knowledge of the receiving Party, is not bound by a duty of
confidentiality, (iii) such information becomes publicly available through no
fault of the receiving Party, (iv) the receiving Parties in good faith
believes that the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in
making any filing or obtaining any consent required for the Merger (in which
case the receiving Party shall advise the other Party before making the
disclosure) or (v) the receiving Party in good faith believes that the
furnishing or use of such information is required by or necessary or
appropriate in connection with any applicable laws or any listing or trading
agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which case the
receiving Party shall advise the other Party before making the disclosure).

All information and materials provided by Atlantic Capital and FSGI pursuant
to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of that certain
confidentiality letter agreement entered into between FSGI and Atlantic
Capital dated July 25, 2014 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(c) No investigation by a Party or its representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties of the other Party set forth in this Agreement.

to the filing of the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, both FSGI and Atlantic
Capital shall consult with the other Party with respect to such filings and
shall afford the other Party and their 

Representatives reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Both FSGI and
Atlantic Capital shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
Subsidiaries to the other Party, and provide such other assistance, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, and the Proxy Statement
and the Form S-4 shall include all information reasonably requested by such
other Party to be included. Atlantic Capital shall also use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and FSGI shall furnish all information concerning FSGI and the
holders of FSGI Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with

(b) Atlantic Capital shall, as soon as practicable following the date the Form

shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 6.9.
Except as expressly contemplated by the two immediately preceding sentences,
Atlantic Capital agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.3
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to Atlantic Capital of any Takeover Proposal. Further, in no
event shall the making of an Adverse Recommendation Change relieve Atlantic
Capital of any obligation to call, give proper notice of, convene, and hold
the Atlantic Capital Shareholders' Meeting, and to distribute, collect,
tabulate and vote proxies for the Atlantic Capital Shareholders' Meeting, in
each case to the extent generally consistent with past practice for Atlantic
Capital shareholders' meetings.

(c) FSGI shall, as soon as practicable following the date the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give proper notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of the FSGI Shareholders ("FSGI
Shareholders' Meeting") for the purpose of approving the Merger (the "FSGI

(i) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the FSGI Shareholders and to
hold the FSGI Shareholders' Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act and (ii) except if the FSGI
Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section
6.9, solicit the FSGI Shareholder Approval. FSGI shall, through the FSGI
Board, recommend to the FSGI Shareholders that they vote for the FSGI
Shareholder Approval (the "FSGI Board Recommendation") and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the FSGI
Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section
6.9. Except as expressly contemplated by the two immediately preceding
sentences, FSGI agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to FSGI of any Takeover Proposal. Further, in no event shall the
making of an Adverse Recommendation Change relieve FSGI of any obligation to
call, give proper notice of, convene, and hold the FSGI Shareholders' Meeting,
and to distribute, collect, tabulate and vote proxies for the FSGI
Shareholders' Meeting, in each case to the extent generally consistent with
past practice for FSGI shareholders' meetings.

6.5

Employee Matters. 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Atlantic Capital shall make offers of
employment to the individuals listed on Section 6.5(a) of the Atlantic Capital
Disclosure Schedule to serve as executive officers of the Surviving
Corporation from and after the Effective Time (the "Surviving Corporation
Officers"). All individuals employed by, or on an authorized leave of absence
from, Atlantic Capital or FSGI or any of their respective Subsidiaries
immediately before the Effective Time (collectively, the "Covered Employees")
shall automatically become employees of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. For the period beginning at the
Effective Time and continuing for twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, provide to each Covered Employee employee benefits, rates of
base salary or hourly wage and annual bonus opportunities that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the rate of base salary or hourly wage and the
employee benefits and annual bonus opportunity provided to such Covered
Employee as in effect immediately before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
(i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Atlantic Capital Benefit Plan
or FSGI Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the
provisions of this Section 6.5, (iii) limit the right of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Covered Employee at any time or require the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries to provide any such employee benefits, rates of base salary
or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such
termination, or (iv) obligate Atlantic Capital, FSGI or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular Atlantic Capital
Benefit Plan or FSGI Benefit Plan, as applicable, or (B) retain the employment
of any particular Covered Employee.

(b) If during the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending nine (9)
months following the Effective Time the employment of a Covered Employee who
does not have an employment, change-of-control or severance agreement with
Atlantic Capital, FSGI or any of their Subsidiaries (i) is terminated by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries due to a permanent or
indefinite reduction in staff resulting in job elimination, reduction of a
position (including a position that had been held at Atlantic Capital or any
of its Subsidiaries) as the result of an organizational or business
restructuring or the integration of Atlantic Capital or any of its
Subsidiaries with FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries, discontinuance of an
operation, relocation of all or a part of FSGI's or its Subsidiaries'
business, sale of an operation to another company, or sale or other change in
ownership of all or a part of FSGI's or its Subsidiaries' business or (ii)
voluntarily resigns after being notified that, as a condition of employment,
such Covered Employee's rate of base salary or hourly wage, employee benefits,
and annual bonus opportunity will be, in the aggregate, materially decreased,
in any case or both cases, such Covered Employee shall be entitled (after
providing customary releases) to receive severance payments equal to two (2)
weeks of severance pay for every year of employment with Atlantic Capital and
its Subsidiaries or FSGI and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, with a minimum severance payment
of three (3) months and a maximum of one (1) year, regardless of employee
classification. 

Atlantic Capital and FSGI shall, and shall each cause their Subsidiaries to,
take whatever action is necessary to terminate any and all other severance
arrangements (other than as set forth in Section 6.5(b) of the Atlantic
Capital Disclosure Schedule and Section 6.5(b) of the FSGI Disclosure Schedule
or pursuant to employment agreements to be entered into between Atlantic
Capital and the Surviving Corporation Officers) and to ensure that Atlantic
Capital and FSGI have no other liability for any other severance payments. The
Parties shall cooperate to effectuate the foregoing, including compliance with
the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act or any similar state or
local law.

Nothing contained in this Section 6.5(b) shall be construed or interpreted to
limit or modify in any way Atlantic Capital's at-will employment policy. In
addition, in no event shall severance pay payable under this Section 6.5(b) to
any Covered Employee who does not have an employment, change-in-control or
severance agreement with FSGI or Atlantic Capital be taken into account in
determining the amount of any other benefit (including an individual's benefit
under any retirement plan, SERP or agreement), unless otherwise provided under
the terms of the controlling document, controlling law or otherwise. If, by
reason of the controlling document, controlling law or otherwise, severance
pay is taken into account in determining any other benefit, the severance pay
otherwise payable shall be reduced by the present value of the additional
benefit determined under other benefit plans attributable to the severance
pay.

The provisions of this Section 6.5(b) shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and, subject to Section 9.12 hereof, shall
be enforceable by, each Covered Employee and his or her heirs and
representatives.

Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any
Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the
fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of FSGI or any
of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of FSGI or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee or employee of another Person
and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
before, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request
of Atlantic Capital pursuant to Section 6.7. 

(c) Atlantic Capital shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of FSGI or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective
Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by
the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by FSGI
with respect to acts or omissions occurring before the Effective Time that
were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such,
provided that Atlantic Capital may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not
less advantageous to such officers and directors than such policy; provided,
further, that (i) in no event shall Atlantic Capital be required to expend on
an annual basis an amount in excess of an amount equal to 200% of the annual
premiums paid by FSGI to procure such directors and officers insurance
coverage for the twelve (12) month period ending December 31, 2014, and (ii)
the officers and directors of FSGI or any FSGI Subsidiary may be required to
make application and provide customary representations and warranties to
Atlantic Capital's insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

6.7

Additional Agreements. 

(a) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including
any merger between a Subsidiary of FSGI, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of
Atlantic Capital, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of the Parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each Party
and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may
be reasonably requested by Atlantic Capital.

(b) Atlantic Capital shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to enable
it to have, as of the Effective Time, cash or cash equivalents that, when

contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

Both FSGI and Atlantic Capital shall promptly advise the other Party of any
change or event (a) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on it or (b) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to

warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the Parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement; provided,
further, that a failure to comply with this Section 6.8 shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in Article
VI to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in

Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which Takeover Proposal did not
result from any breach of this Section 6.9, then such Receiving Party and its
Representatives may, upon the good faith determination of its Board of
Directors, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including non-public information) with respect to such Receiving
Party and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such
Takeover Proposal and their respective Representatives; provided that such
Receiving Party shall (subject to the terms of Confidentiality Agreement)
promptly make available to the other Party (the "Non-Receiving Party")
(through an electronic dataroom or otherwise), and concurrently provide
express written notification, via electronic mail notification to the Non-
Receiving Party in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 9.4,
of the availability of, any written material non-public information that is
provided to any such Person or group of Persons or their respective
Representatives, if such information was not previously provided to the Non-
Receiving Party or its Representatives, and (ii) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons
making such Takeover Proposal and their respective Representatives; provided,
further that the Receiving Party promptly provides to the Non-Receiving Party
(1) a copy of any Takeover Proposal made in writing by any such Person or
group of Persons to the Receiving Party, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Representatives, and the identity of the Person making the
Takeover Proposal, and (2) a written summary of the material terms of any such
Takeover Proposal not made in writing. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Acceptable Confidentiality 

Agreement" means any confidentiality agreement that contains provisions with
respect to confidentiality matters that are no less favorable to such Party
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The Receiving Party shall keep the Non-Receiving Party reasonably informed
of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding the
Takeover Proposal, including any such proposal first made or discussed with
the Receiving Party prior to the date of this Agreement (including forwarding
to the Non-Receiving Party any written materials provided to the Receiving
Party or its Representatives in connection with any such Takeover Proposal) on
a current basis, and shall notify the Non-Receiving Party of the status of
such Takeover Proposal.

(d) Except as permitted by Section 6.9(f), upon the receipt by FSGI of a
Takeover Proposal, the FSGI Board shall not (i) (A) fail to recommend to its

withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Atlantic Capital, the
FSGI Board Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer other than a recommendation of rejection of such offer or a
temporary "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of
the Exchange Act, or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to its shareholders, a Takeover Proposal (actions
described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "FSGI Adverse
Recommendation Change") or (ii) cause or permit FSGI or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in
principle with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) (each, an "Acquisition Agreement").

(e) Except as permitted by Section 6.9(f), upon the receipt by Atlantic
Capital of a Takeover Proposal, the Atlantic Capital Board shall not (i)
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to
its shareholders, such Takeover Proposal (an "Atlantic Capital Adverse
Recommendation Change" and, together with the FSGI Adverse Recommendation
Change, an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) cause or permit Atlantic
Capital or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Acquisition Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to (x) with respect
to FSGI, the time that the FSGI Shareholder Approval is obtained, and (y) with
respect to Atlantic Capital, the time that the Atlantic Capital Shareholder
Approval is obtained, the Board of Directors of the Receiving Party may, in
connection with a bona fide written Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal
was made after the date of this Agreement (or that was made prior to the date
of this Agreement and remade after the date of this Agreement) and that did
not result from any breach of this Section 6.9, make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i) or 8.1(j) to
enter into a definitive merger agreement or other definitive purchase or
acquisition agreement with respect to such Takeover Proposal, if and only if,
prior to taking such action, such Receiving Party has complied with its
obligations under this Section 6.9 and the Board of Directors of such Party
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that prior to taking any
such action (i) the Receiving Party has given the Non-Receiving Party at least
five (5) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action (which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any
such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided a copy to the Non-
Receiving Party of all written materials (including all transaction agreements
and related documents) with or from the Person or group of Persons making such
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Receiving Party has negotiated, and has caused 

its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the Non-Receiving Party
during such notice period to the extent the Non-Receiving Party wishes to
negotiate, to enable the Non-Receiving Party to revise the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal and (iii) following the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of the Receiving Party shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by the Non-
Receiving Party, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given
effect. In the event of any material revisions to a Takeover Proposal that
could have an impact, influence or other effect on the Receiving Party's Board
of Directors' decision or discussion with respect to whether such proposal is
a Superior Proposal, the Receiving Party shall deliver a new written notice to
the Non-Receiving Party pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) and again comply
with the requirements of this Section 6.9(f) with respect to such new written
notice; provided, however, that references herein to the five (5) business day
period shall be deemed to be references to a three (3) business day period
with respect thereto.

(g) Provided that the Receiving Party and its Board of Directors comply with
their applicable obligations under Section 6.9(f), nothing in this Section 6.9
shall prohibit the Receiving Party's Board of Directors from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Receiving Party's shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communications to
the Receiving Party's shareholders pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the Receiving Party's
shareholders); provided, however, that the taking of any action pursuant to
either of the preceding clauses (i) or (ii) shall in no way limit or modify
the effect of this Agreement with respect to any such action taken.

(h) As used in this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person (other than a Party or its Subsidiaries) or
"group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to,
in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any (i) acquisition
of assets of the Receiving Party and its Subsidiaries equal to more than 50%
of the Receiving Party's consolidated assets or to which more than 50% of the
Receiving Party's net income on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii)
acquisition of more than 50% of the outstanding common stock of the Receiving
Party or the capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Receiving Party, (iii)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning more than 50% of the outstanding common stock of the
Receiving Party, (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Receiving Party or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated,
would result in the shareholders of the Receiving Party immediately preceding
such transaction holding less than 50% of the equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity (or the parent of such entity) of such
transaction or (v) any liquidation or resolution of the Receiving Party; in
each case other than the Merger.

(i) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that the Receiving Party's Board of Directors has
determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms and that is reasonably likely to
result in the consummation of a transaction more favorable to the Receiving
Party's shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking
into account (a) all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal
(including availability of financing and certainty of closing) and the Person
making the proposal; and (b) any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Non-Receiving Party in response to such proposal or otherwise.

Agreement or fraud, and the aggrieved Party will be entitled to all rights and
remedies available at law or in equity.

(d) This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken or

delivered under this Agreement, if such alteration or change would adversely
affect the shareholders entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, 

(ii) alters or changes any term of the articles of incorporation of the

amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

ARTICLE EIGHT 
DIRECTOR'S LIABILITY

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no director of the
Corporation shall have any liability to the Corporation or its shareholders

which are actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened,
pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative, in which such person may be involved by
reason of his being or having been a director or officer of this Corporation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this Article is
intended to provide indemnification to each director and officer of the
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Code, as the same exists

ATLANTIC CAPITAL BANCSHARES, INC.

______, 2015





Exhibit C - Page 1 ARTICLE ONE 
OFFICES

1.1 Registered Office and Agent. The Corporation shall have and continuously
maintain a registered office and registered agent in accordance with the
provisions of Section 14-2-501 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code.

1.2 Other Offices. The Corporation may have offices at such place or places
within or without the State of Georgia as the Board of Directors may from time
to time appoint or the business of the Corporation may require or make
desirable.

ARTICLE TWO 
SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

2.1 Annual Meeting. A meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be
held annually. The annual meeting shall be held at such time and place and on
such date as the Board of Directors shall determine from time to time and as
shall be specified in the notice of the meeting.

2.2 Special Meetings. Special meeting of the shareholders may be called at any
time by the Corporation's Board of Directors, its President, or by the
Corporation upon the written request of any one or more shareholders, owning
an aggregate of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding
capital stock of the Corporation. Special meetings shall be held at such time
and place and on such dates as shall be specified in the notice of the
meeting.

2.3 Place. Annual and special meetings of shareholders may be held within or
without the State of Georgia.

2.4 Notice; Waiver of Notice. Notice of annual or special meetings of
shareholders stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting shall be given in
writing or by electronic transmission not less than ten (10) days nor more
than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, and shall be given to
each shareholder by mail or electronic transmission to the last known address
of the shareholder or by personal delivery to the shareholder. Notice of any
special meeting of shareholders shall state the purpose or purposes for which
the meeting is called. The notice of any meeting at which amendments to or
restatements of the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws, merger or share
exchange of the Corporation, or the disposition of corporate assets requiring
shareholder approval are to be considered shall state such purpose, and shall
further comply with all requirements of law. Notice of a meeting may be waived
by an instrument in writing or by electronic transmission signed by the
shareholder before or after the meeting. The waiver need not specify the
purpose of the meeting or the business transacted, unless one of the purposes
of the meeting concerns a plan of merger or share exchange, in which event the
waiver shall comply with the further requirements of law concerning such
waivers. Attendance of a shareholder at a meeting, either in person or by
proxy, shall of itself constitute waiver of lack of notice or defective notice
of the meeting and waiver of any objections to consideration of a particular
matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in
the notice, unless the shareholder or the appointed proxy at the beginning of
the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the
meeting or objects to considering the matter not described in the notice when
it is presented. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given otherwise
than by announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.





Exhibit C - Page 2 2.5 Advance Notice of Shareholder Nominees for Director and Other Shareholder
Proposals. The matters to be considered and brought before any annual or
special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation shall be limited to only
such matters, including the nomination and election of directors, as shall be
brought properly before such meeting in compliance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 2.5.

For any matter to be brought properly before any annual meeting of
shareholders, the matter must be (i) specified in the notice of the annual
meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise
brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or (iii) brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder who is a
shareholder of record of the Corporation on the date the notice provided for
in this Section 2.5 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is
entitled to vote at the annual meeting and who complies with the procedures
set forth in this Section 2.5.

In addition to any other requirements under applicable law and the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation, written notice (the "Shareholder
Notice") of any nomination or other proposal must be timely and any proposal,
other than a nomination, must constitute a proper matter for shareholder
action. To be timely, the Shareholder Notice must be delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive office of the
Corporation not less than 90 nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior
to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year;
provided, however, that if (and only if) the annual meeting is not scheduled
to be held within a period that commences thirty (30) days before such
anniversary date and ends within sixty (60) days after such anniversary date
(an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an
"Other Meeting Date"), the Shareholder Notice shall be given in the manner
provided herein by the later of the close of business on (i) the date ninety
(90) days prior to such Other Meeting Date or (ii) the tenth day following the
date such Other Meeting Date is first publicly announced or disclosed.

A Shareholder Notice must contain the following information: (i) whether the
shareholder is providing the notice at the request of a beneficial holder of
shares, whether the shareholder, any such beneficial holder or any nominee has
any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, or has received any
financial assistance, funding or other consideration from, any other person
with respect to the investment by the shareholder or such beneficial holder in
the Corporation or the matter the Shareholder Notice relates to, and the
details thereof, including the name of such other person (the shareholder, any
beneficial holder on whose behalf the notice is being delivered, any nominees
listed in the notice and any persons with whom such agreement, arrangement or
understanding exists or from whom such assistance has been obtained are
hereinafter collectively referred to as "Interested Persons"), (ii) the name
and address of all Interested Persons, (iii) a complete listing of the record
and beneficial ownership positions (including number or amount) of all equity
securities and debt instruments, whether held in the form of loans or capital
market instruments, of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries held by all
Interested Persons, (iv) whether and the extent to which any hedging,
derivative or other transaction is in place or has been entered into within
the prior six (6) months preceding the date of delivery of the Shareholder
Notice by or for the benefit of any Interested Person with respect to the
Corporation or its subsidiaries or any of their respective securities, debt
instruments or credit ratings, the effect or intent of which transaction is to
give rise to gain or loss as a result of changes in the trading price of such
securities or debt instruments or changes in the credit ratings for the
Corporation, its subsidiaries or any of their respective securities or debt
instruments (or, more generally, changes in the





Exhibit C - Page 3 perceived creditworthiness of the corporation or its subsidiaries), or to
increase or decrease the voting power of such Interested Person, and if so, a
summary of the material terms thereof, and (v) a representation that the
shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation that would be
entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at
the meeting to propose the matter set forth in the Shareholder Notice. As used
herein, "beneficially owned" has the meaning provided in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Shareholder Notice shall be
updated not later than ten (10) days after the record date for the
determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting to provide any
material changes in the foregoing information as of the record date.

Any Shareholder Notice relating to the nomination of directors must also
contain (i) the information regarding each nominee required by paragraphs (a),
(e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (or the corresponding provisions of any successor
regulation), (ii) each nominee's signed consent to serve as a director of the
Corporation if elected, and (iii) whether each nominee is eligible for
consideration as an independent director under the relevant standards
contemplated by Item 407(a) of Regulation S-K (or the corresponding provisions
of any successor regulation). The Corporation may also require any proposed
nominee to furnish such other information, including completion of the
Corporation's directors' questionnaire, as it may reasonably require to
determine whether the nominee would be considered "independent" as a director
or as a member of the audit committee of the Board of Directors under the
various rules and standards applicable to the Corporation. Any Shareholder
Notice with respect to a matter other than the nomination of directors must
contain (i) the text of the proposal to be presented, including the text of
any resolutions to be proposed for consideration by shareholders and (ii) a
brief written statement of the reasons why such shareholder favors the
proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.5 to the contrary, in the
event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of
the Corporation is increased and either all of the nominees for director or
the size of the increased Board of Directors is not publicly announced or
disclosed by the Corporation at least one hundred (100) days prior to the
first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a Shareholder Notice
shall also be considered timely hereunder, but only with respect to nominees
for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to
the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive office of the
Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following
the first date all of such nominees or the size of the increased Board of
Directors shall have been publicly announced or disclosed.

For any matter to be brought properly before a special meeting of
shareholders, the matter must be set forth in the Corporation's notice of the
meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors. In the event
that the Corporation calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose
of electing one or more persons to the Board of Directors, any shareholder may
nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such
position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of the meeting, if the
Shareholder Notice required by Section 2.5 shall be delivered to the Secretary
of the Corporation at the principal executive office of the Corporation not
later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which
the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of
Directors to be elected at such meeting is publicly announced or disclosed.

For purposes of this Section 2.5, a matter shall be deemed to have been
"publicly announced or disclosed" if such matter is disclosed in a press
release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,





Exhibit C - Page 4 Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In no event shall the postponement or adjournment of an annual meeting already
publicly noticed, or any announcement of such postponement or adjournment,
commence a new period (or extend any time period) for the giving of notice as
provided in this Section 2.5. This Section 2.5 shall not apply to shareholders
proposals made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

The person presiding at any meeting of shareholders, in addition to making any
other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting,
shall have the power and duty to determine whether notice of nominees and
other matters proposed to be brought before a meeting has been duly given in
the manner provided in this Section 2.5 and, if not so given, shall direct and
declare at the meeting that such nominees and other matters are not properly
before the meeting and shall not be considered. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.5, if the shareholder or a qualified
representative of the shareholder does not appear at the annual or special
meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to present any such nomination, or
make any such proposal, such nomination or proposal shall be disregarded,
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by
the Corporation.

2.6 Quorum. At all meetings of shareholders, a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Corporation shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business, and no resolution or business shall be transacted without the
favorable vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented at the
meeting and entitled to vote, unless a higher vote is required by the Articles
of Incorporation. A lesser number may adjourn from day to day, and shall
announce the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned.

2.7 Proxies; Required Vote. At every meeting of the shareholders, including
meetings of shareholders for the election of directors, any shareholder having
the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, but no
proxy shall be voted after eleven (11) months from its date, unless said proxy
provides for a longer period. Each shareholder shall have one vote for each
share of stock having voting power, registered in his or her name on the books
of the Corporation. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders, except as otherwise
provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws.

2.8 Presiding Officer and Secretary. At every meeting of shareholders, the
Chairman or the President, or, if such officers shall not be present, then the
person appointed by one of them, shall preside. The Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary, or if such officers shall not be present, the appointee of the
presiding officer of the meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

2.9 Shareholders' List. The officer or agent having charge of the stock
transfer books of the Corporation shall produce for inspection by any
shareholder a complete alphabetical list of shareholders showing the address
and share holdings of each shareholder. The shareholders' list must be
available for inspection by any shareholder, his or her agent, or his or her
attorney during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of
the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held in person, then the list shall
be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the duration
of the meeting and may be inspected by any shareholder who is present. If the
meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list
shall also be open to the examination of any shareholder during the duration





Exhibit C - Page 5 of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
the meeting.

2.10 Action in Lieu of Meeting. Any action required to be taken at a meeting
of the shareholders, or any action which may be taken at a meeting of the
shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if one or more written consents,
setting forth the date of signature and the action authorized and delivered to
the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate
records, [shall be signed and dated by all the shareholders entitled to vote
on such action or, if so provided in the Articles of Incorporation, by those
persons who would be entitled to vote at a meeting those shares having voting
power to cast not less than the minimum number (or numbers, in the case of
voting by groups) of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote were present and
voted.] Such consents shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of the
shareholders at a special meeting called for considering the action
authorized. The rights set forth in this Section shall be governed by and
subject to the provisions of Section 14-2-704 of the Georgia Business
Corporation Code, and no written consent shall be effective except upon
compliance with the provisions of Section 14-2-704(b) of such code.

ARTICLE THREE 
DIRECTORS

3.1 Management. Subject to these Bylaws, or any lawful agreement between the
shareholders, the full and entire management of the affairs and business of
the Corporation shall be vested in the Board of Directors, which shall have
and may exercise all of the powers that may be exercised or performed by the
Corporation.

3.2 Number of Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than
five (5) nor more than twenty-five (25) members. The number of directors may
be fixed or changed from time to time, within the minimum and maximum, by the
shareholders by the affirmative vote of majority of all the shares entitled to
vote in an election of directors; or by the Board of Directors by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office.

3.3 Vacancies. The Board of Directors, even though less than a quorum, may
fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors, including a vacancy created by an
increase in the number of directors. Such appointment by the Board of
Directors shall continue until the expiration of the term of the director
whose place has become vacant or, in the case of an increase in the number of
directors, until the next meeting of the shareholders.

3.4 Election of Directors. The directors shall be elected at each annual
shareholders meeting and shall serve for a term of one year and until their
successors are elected or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation, or removal. [Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each holder of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of
the Corporation entitled to vote in an election of directors shall have the
right to elect a director; provided, however, this right shall expire upon the
first to occur of (i) May 1, 2016, (ii) the time immediately prior to the
effectiveness of a registration statement for an underwritten public offering
for each of the shares of the Corporation pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933, and (iii) the time immediately prior to when shares of the Corporation
are listed on a national securities exchange or regularly traded in a market
maintained by securities dealers or brokers.]





Exhibit C - Page 6 3.5 Removal. The shareholders may remove one or more directors at a meeting of
the shareholders with respect to which notice of such purpose is given: with
or without cause, upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote in an election of
directors, [except that a director elected pursuant to Section 3.4 by a holder
of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote in an election of directors may be removed
without cause only by the affirmative vote of the shareholder who elected such
director. For purposes of this Section, a director of the Corporation may be
removed for cause if (i) the director has been convicted of a felony; (ii) any
bank regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Corporation requests or
demands the removal; or (iii) at least two‑thirds (2/3) of the directors of
the Corporation then in office, excluding only the director who is subject to
the vote regarding his or her removal, determine that such director's
continued service is not in the best interests of the Corporation. In the
event a director elected pursuant to Section 3.4 by a holder of twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of the outstanding shares of the Corporation is removed,
the shareholder who elected such director shall have the sole right to replace
the removed director with a director of his or her choice, if such shareholder
would, at the time of replacement, still be entitled to elect a director
pursuant to Section 3.4.

3.6 Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by delivering notice in
writing or by electronic transmission to the Board of Directors or its
chairperson or to the Corporation. A director who resigns may postpone the
effectiveness of his or her resignation to a future date or upon the
occurrence of a future event specified in a written tender of resignation. If
no time of effectiveness is specified therein, a resignation shall be
effective upon tender. A vacancy shall be deemed to exist at the time a
resignation is tendered, and the Board of Directors or the shareholders may,
then or thereafter, elect a successor to take office when the resignation by
its terms becomes effective.

3.7 Compensation. Directors may be allowed such compensation for their
services as directors as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the
Board of Directors.

3.8 Honorary and Advisory Directors. When a director of the Corporation
retires under the retirement policies of the Corporation as established from
time to time by the Board of Directors, such director automatically shall
become an Honorary Director of the Corporation following his or her
retirement. The Board of Directors of the Corporation also may appoint any
individual an Honorary Director, Director Emeritus, or member of any advisory
board established by the Board of Directors. Any individual automatically
becoming an Honorary Director or appointed an Honorary Director, Director
Emeritus, or member of an advisory board as provided by this Section 3.8 may
be compensated as provided in Section 3.7, but such individual may not vote at
any meeting of the Board of Directors or be counted in determining a quorum as
provided in Section 5.5 and shall not have any responsibility or be subject to
any liability imposed upon a director, or otherwise be deemed a director.

ARTICLE FOUR

shareholders and until the member's successor is elected and qualified, or
until the member's death, resignation, or removal, or until the member shall
cease to be a director.

(b) During the intervals between the meetings of the Board of Directors, the

in reference to (i) an amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or an
adoption, amendment, or repeal of the Bylaws; (ii) an adoption of a plan of
merger or consolidation; (iii) a sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition
of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Corporation; (iv) a
voluntary dissolution of the Corporation or the revocation of any such
voluntary dissolution; (v) the determination of whether or not for cause

or proposal to the shareholders of an action that the Georgia Business
Corporation Code requires to be approved by the shareholders; or (vii) the
removal of any or all of the Officers of the Corporation.

(c) The Executive Committee shall meet from time to time on call of the
Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President or of any two or more
members of the Executive Committee. Meetings of the Executive Committee may be
held at such place or places, within or without the State of Georgia, as the
Executive Committee shall determine or as may be specified or fixed in the
respective notices or waivers of such meetings. The Executive Committee may
fix its own rules of procedure, including provision for notice of its
meetings. It shall keep a record of its proceedings and shall report these
proceedings to the Board of Directors at the meeting thereof held next after
they have been taken, and all such proceedings shall be subject to revision or
alteration by the Board of Directors except to the extent that action shall
have been taken pursuant to or in reliance upon such proceedings prior to any
such revision or alteration.

(d) The Executive Committee shall act by majority vote of its members;
provided, however, that contracts or transactions of and by the Corporation in
which officers or directors of the Corporation are interested shall require
the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested members of the
Executive Committee at a meeting of the Executive Committee at which the
material facts as to the interest and as to the contract or transaction are
disclosed or known to the members of the Executive Committee prior to the
vote.

(e) Members of the Executive Committee may participate in committee
proceedings by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the proceedings can
hear each other, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at
such proceedings.

(f) The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted in accordance with paragraph
(a) of this Section, may designate one or more directors as alternate members
of the Executive Committee who may act in the place and stead of any absent
member or members at any meeting of said committee.

4.2 Other Committees. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the entire Board of Directors, may designate one or more
additional committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the
directors of the Corporation, which shall have such name or names and shall
have and may exercise such powers of the Board of Directors, except the powers
denied to the Executive Committee, as may be determined from time to time by
the Board of Directors. Such committees shall provide for their own rules of
procedure, subject to the same restrictions thereon as provided above for the
Executive Committee.





Exhibit C - Page 7 4.3 Removal. The Board of Directors shall have power at any time to remove any
member of any committee, with or without cause, to increase or decrease the
number of members, and to fill vacancies in and to dissolve any such
committee.

place either within or without the State of Georgia.

5.2 Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held
without notice at such time and place, within or without the State of Georgia,
as shall be determined by the Board of Directors from time to time.

5.3 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called
by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President on not less than
one (1) day's notice by mail, email, telegram, cablegram, personal delivery,
or telephone to each director and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board
of Directors or the President in like manner and on like notice on the written
request of any [two] or more directors. Any such special meeting shall be held
at such time and place, within or without the State of Georgia, as shall be
stated in the notice of the meeting.

5.4 Content and Waiver of Notice. No notice of any meeting of the Board of
Directors need state the purposes thereof, except as may be otherwise provided
in the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws. Notice of any meeting may be
waived in writing or by electronic transmission signed by the director before
or after the meeting. Attendance in person at any such meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice thereof unless the director at the beginning of
the meeting (or promptly upon his or her arrival) objects to holding the
meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote
for or assent to any action taken at the meeting.

5.5 Quorum; Participation by Telephone. At all meetings of the Board of
Directors, the presence of a majority of the number of directors in office
immediately prior to such meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Directors may participate
in any meeting by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in a meeting by means of such communications
equipment shall constitute the presence in person at such meeting. Except as
may be otherwise specifically provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation,
or these Bylaws, all resolutions adopted and all business transacted by the
Board of Directors shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors present at the meeting. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of
the directors present at any meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time
until a quorum is present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need only be given
by announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

5.6 Action in Lieu of Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at
any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may be taken
without a meeting if one or more consents in writing or by electronic
transmission describing the action taken are signed by all the members of the
Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, and such consents
are filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors and
upon compliance with any further requirements of law pertaining to such
consents.

5.7 Interested Directors and Officers. An interested director or officer is
one who is a party to a contract or transaction with the Corporation or who is
an officer or director of, or has a financial interest in, another
corporation, partnership, or association which is a party to a contract or
transaction with the Corporation. Contracts and transactions between the
Corporation and one or more interested directors or officers shall not be void
or voidable solely because of the involvement or vote of such interested
persons as long as (a) the contract or transaction is approved in good faith
by the Board of Directors or the appropriate committee by the affirmative vote
of a majority of disinterested directors, even if the disinterested directors
be less than a quorum, at a meeting of the Board of Directors or the committee
at which the material facts as to the interested person or persons and the
contract or transaction are disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or
the committee prior to the vote; or (b) the contract or transaction is
approved in good faith by the shareholders after the material facts as to the
interested person or persons and the contract or transaction have been
disclosed to them; or (c) the contract or transaction is fair as to the
Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified by the
Board of Directors, the committee, or the shareholders. Interested directors
may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the
Board of Directors or the committee which authorizes the contract or
transaction.

Removal shall be without prejudice to the Corporation's contract rights. The
compensation of officers, agents, and employees elected by the Board of

President who has served in that capacity for the longest time and who shall

the powers of the Chief Executive Officer. The performance of any such duty by
any Vice President shall be conclusive evidence of his or her power to act.

6.4 Powers and Duties of the Secretary. The Secretary shall have charge of the

CAPITAL STOCK

(a) The interest of each shareholder may but need not be evidenced by a
certificate or certificates representing shares of the Corporation which shall

shall be numbered and entered into the books of the Corporation as they are
issued. Each certificate representing shares shall set forth upon the face
thereof the following:

(i) the name of the Corporation;

(ii) that the Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Georgia;

(iii) the name or names of the person or persons to whom the certificate is
issued;

(iv) the number and class of shares, and the designation of the series, if
any, which the certificate represents; and

respect to dividends or amounts payable on liquidation, the certificate shall
further set forth on either the face or the back thereof a clear and concise
statement to that effect.

(b) Each certificate shall be signed, either manually or in facsimile, by the
President or a Vice President and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary and
may be sealed with the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof. If a
certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent or registered by a registrar,
other than the Corporation itself or an employee of the Corporation, the
signature of any such officer of the Corporation may be a facsimile. In case
any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or
signatures shall have been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall
cease to be such officer or officers of the Corporation, whether because of
death, resignation, or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates
shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates
may nevertheless be delivered as though the person or persons who signed such
certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signatures shall have been used
thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers.

(c) Unless the Corporation's articles of incorporation provide otherwise, the
Board of Directors may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of the
Corporation of any or all of its classes or series without certificates. Such
authorization shall not affect shares already represented by certificates
until they are surrendered to the Corporation.

(d) Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares without
certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholder then owning such
shares a written statement of the information required to be placed on
certificates by Section 7.1(a) of these Bylaws and applicable law.

Corporation only by the person named in the certificate (or in the case of
uncertificated shares, the owner of record), or by power of attorney lawfully
constituted in writing (by such person or owner), and upon surrender of the
certificate, or in the case of a certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, upon compliance with the provisions of Section 7.7 of
these Bylaws.

7.3 Record Dates. For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment
thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a
determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of
Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such
determination of shareholders, such date to be not more than seventy (70) days
and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10) days, prior
to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of
shareholders is to be taken.

7.4 Registered Owner. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of
record of any share of stock of the Corporation as the person entitled to vote
such share, to receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to such
share, and for all other purposes and accordingly shall not be bound to
recognize any equitable or other claim or interest in such share on the part
of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof, except as otherwise provided by law.





Exhibit C - Page 11 7.5 Transfer Agent and Registrar. The Board of Directors may appoint one or
more transfer agents and one or more registrars and may require each stock

stolen, or destroyed shall make an affidavit or affirmation of the fact in
such manner as the Board of Directors may require and, if the directors so
require, shall give the Corporation a bond of indemnity in form and amount and
with one or more sureties satisfactory to the Board of Directors, whereupon an
appropriate new certificate may be issued in lieu of the certificate alleged
to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

7.7 Fractional Shares or Scrip. The Corporation may, when and if authorized to
do so by its Board of Directors, issue certificates for fractional shares or
scrip in order to effect share transfers, share distributions, or
reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or reorganizations. Holders of
fractional shares shall be entitled, in proportion to their fractional
holdings, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, and participate in any
of the assets of the Corporation in the event of liquidation. Holders of scrip
shall not, unless expressly authorized by the Board of Directors, be entitled
to exercise any rights of a shareholder of the Corporation, including voting
rights, dividend rights, or the right to participate in any assets of the
Corporation in the event of liquidation. In lieu of issuing fractional shares
or scrip, the Corporation may pay in cash the fair value of fractional
interests as determined by the Board of Directors; and the Board of Directors
may adopt resolutions regarding rights with respect to fractional shares or
scrip as it may deem appropriate, including, without limitation, the right for
persons entitled to receive fractional shares to sell such fractional shares
or purchase such additional fractional shares as may be needed to acquire one
full share, or sell such fractional shares or scrip for the account of such
persons.

ARTICLE EIGHT

(a) Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by law, any person who

record of, at least two percent (2%) of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation, upon written demand stating the purpose thereof, shall have the
right to examine in person or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable time or
times, for any proper purpose, the books and records of account, minutes, and
record of shareholders and to make extracts therefrom.

(b) A shareholder may inspect and copy the records described in the
immediately preceding paragraph only if (i) his or her demand is made in good
faith and for a proper purpose that is reasonably relevant to his or her
legitimate interest as a shareholder; (ii) the shareholder describes with
reasonable particularity his or her purpose and the records he or she desires
to inspect; (iii) the records are directly connected with the stated purpose;
and (iv) the records are to be used only for that purpose.

(c) If the Secretary or a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or
Executive Committee find that the request is proper, the Secretary shall
promptly notify the shareholder of the time and place at which the inspection
may be conducted.

(d) If said request is found by the Secretary, the Board of Directors, or the
Executive Committee to be improper, the Secretary shall so notify the
requesting shareholder on or prior to the date on which the shareholder
requested to conduct the inspection. The Secretary shall specify in said
notice the basis for the rejection of the shareholder's request.

(e) The Secretary, Board of Directors, and the Executive Committee shall at
all times be entitled to rely on the corporate records in making any
determination hereunder.

8.2 Seal. The Corporate seal shall be in such form as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine. In the event it is inconvenient to use such a
seal at any time, the signature of the Corporation followed by the word "Seal"
enclosed in parentheses or scroll shall be deemed the seal of the Corporation.

8.3 Annual Statements. Not later than four (4) months after the close of each
fiscal year, and in any case prior to the next annual meeting of shareholders,
the Corporation shall prepare:

(a) A balance sheet showing in reasonable detail the financial condition of

ARTICLE NINE 
INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Authority to Indemnify. The Corporation shall indemnify or obligate itself
to indemnify an individual made a party to a proceeding because he or she is
or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation (or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise) for reasonable expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, and amounts
paid in settlement (including attorneys' fees), incurred in connection with
the proceeding if the individual conducted himself or herself in good faith
and reasonably believed that such conduct was (a) in the case of conduct in
his or her official capacity, in the best interests of the Corporation, (b) in
all other cases, at least not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, he or she had no
reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful. The termination of a
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the
director, officer, employee, or agent did not meet the standard of conduct set
forth above. Indemnification permitted under this Section in connection with a
proceeding by, or in the right of, the Corporation is limited to reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding if it is determined that
the director, officer, employee, or agent has met the relevant standard of
conduct under this Section.

9.2 Mandatory Indemnification. To the extent that a director, officer,
employee, or agent of the Corporation has been wholly successful, on the
merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she was a
party, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, because he or she
is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, the
Corporation shall indemnify the director, employee, or agent against
reasonable expenses incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

9.3 Advance for Expenses. The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the
reasonable expenses incurred by a director, officer, employee, or agent of the
Corporation who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of
the proceeding if (a) he or she furnishes the Corporation written affirmation
of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct
set forth in Section 9.1 of this Article, and (b) he or she furnishes the
Corporation a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her
behalf, to repay any advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she is
not entitled to indemnification. The undertaking required by this Section must
be an unlimited general obligation, but need not be secured and may be
accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

9.4 Court-ordered Indemnification and Advances for Expenses. A director,
officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation who is a party to a proceeding
may apply for indemnification or advances for expenses to the court conducting
the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction.

9.5 Determination of Indemnification. Except as provided in Section 9.2 and
except as may be ordered by the court, the Corporation may not indemnify a
director, officer, employee, or agent under Section 9.1 unless authorized
thereunder and a determination has been made in the specific case that
indemnification of the director, officer, employee, or agent is permissible in
the circumstances because he or she has met the standard of conduct set forth
in Section 9.1. The determination shall be made:

(a) If there are two or more disinterested directors, by the Board of
Directors by a majority vote of all the disinterested directors (a majority of
whom shall for such purpose constitute a quorum) or by a majority of the
members of a committee of two or more disinterested directors appointed by
such a vote;

(b) By special legal counsel:

(i) Selected in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Section; or

(ii) If there are fewer than two disinterested directors, selected by the
Board of Directors (in which selection directors who do not qualify as
disinterested directors may participate); or

(c) By the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of a
director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested director may not
be voted on the determination.

9.6 Authorization of Indemnification. Authorization of indemnification or an
obligation to indemnify and evaluation as to the reasonableness of expenses
shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is
permissible, except that if the determination is made by special legal
counsel, authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness
of expenses shall be made by those entitled under paragraph (b) of Section 9.5
to select counsel.

9.7 Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by
or granted pursuant to this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights, in respect of indemnification or otherwise, to which those seeking
indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw,
resolution, agreement, or contract, either specifically or in general terms,
approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
entitled to vote thereon, taken at a meeting the notice of which specified
that such bylaw, resolution, or agreement would be placed before the
shareholders, both as to action by a director, trustee, officer, employee, or
agent in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office or position; except that no such other rights, in
respect to indemnification or otherwise, may be provided or granted to a
director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent pursuant to this Section 9.7 by
the Corporation for liability for (a) any appropriation, in violation of his
or her duties, of any business opportunity of the Corporation; (b) acts or
omissions which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
(c) the types of liability set forth in Section 14-2-832 of the Georgia
Business Corporation Code dealing with illegal or unauthorized distributions
of corporate assets, whether as dividends or in liquidation of the Corporation
or otherwise; or (d) any transaction from which he or she received an improper
material tangible personal benefit. Neither the amendment or repeal of this
Article nor the adoption of any provision to these Bylaws inconsistent with
this Article shall eliminate or adversely affect any right or protection of
any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation existing
immediately prior to such amendment or repeal or adoption.

9.8 Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of an individual who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the
Corporation or who, while a director, officer, employee, or agent of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or
domestic corporation, partnership joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan,
or other entity against liability asserted against or incurred by him or her
in that capacity or arising from his or her status as a director, officer,
employee, or agent whether or not the Corporation would have power to
indemnify him or her against the same liability under this Article.

9.9 Continuation of Expenses. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by or granted pursuant to this Article shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such
a person.

order of seniority, directors for such meeting.

11.7 Liability of Officers, Directors, and Agents. No officer, director,
agent, or employee acting in accordance with any emergency bylaw shall be
liable except for willful misconduct. No officer, director, agent, or employee

emergency in furtherance of the ordinary business affairs of the Corporation
even though not authorized by the bylaws then in effect.

at a meeting of the shareholders, notice of the general nature of the proposed
change in the Bylaws shall be given in the notice of meeting. The shareholders
may provide by resolution that any bylaw provision repealed, amended, adopted,
or altered by them may not be repealed, amended, adopted, or altered by the

delivered this Agreement and, assuming its due authorization, execution and
delivery by [Atlantic Capital / FSGI], this Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder, enforceable against the
Shareholder in accordance with its terms. The execution and delivery by the
Shareholder of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the terms hereof will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination,





Exhibit C - Page 14 cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon the Covered Shares
under, any provision of any agreement to which the Shareholder is a party or

matters referred to in the next sentence, any provision of any law or
judicial, regulatory or other administrative order or decree applicable to the

any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval

shall, (i) if a meeting is held, appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the
Covered Shares to be counted as present at such meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum, and (ii) vote (or cause to be voted) the Covered
Shares, as applicable, in favor of the Covered Actions. The Shareholder
represents that any proxies heretofore given in respect of the Covered Shares
that may still be in effect are not irrevocable, and such proxies are hereby

(other than the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger), (ii) any Takeover Proposal (including any Superior
Proposal) with respect to the Company, and (iii) any other proposal or
transaction involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary, which amendment
or other proposal or transaction would in any manner impede, frustrate,
prevent or nullify any provision of the Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, or change in any
manner the voting rights of any class of capital stock of the Company. The
Shareholder shall not commit or agree to take any action inconsistent with the
foregoing.



(c)Other than pursuant to this Agreement, the Shareholder shall not (i) sell,
transfer, pledge, hypothecate, assign or otherwise dispose of (including by
gift), hedge or utilize a derivative to transfer the economic interest in
(collectively, "Transfer"), or enter into any agreement, option or other
arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) with respect to the
Transfer of, or propose to Transfer, any Covered Shares to any Person, (ii)
enter into, or propose to enter into, any voting arrangement, whether by
proxy, voting agreement or otherwise, with respect to any Covered Shares,
(iii) take any action that would make any representation or warranty of the
Shareholder herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing or
disabling the Shareholder from performing its obligations hereunder or (iv)
commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions in clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii). This Section 2(c) shall not prohibit a Transfer to any member of
Shareholder's immediate family, or to a trust for the benefit of Shareholder
or any member of Shareholder's immediate family, or upon the death of
Shareholder; provided that, as a precondition to such Transfer, [(x)] the
transferee agrees in writing, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
[Atlantic Capital / FSGI], to be bound by all terms of this Agreement, and (y)
such Transfer, in the reasonable opinion of [Atlantic Capital / FSGI], shall
not require [Atlantic Capital / FSGI] to amend any filings or disclosures that
it has made pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, or any other
law, rule or regulation applicable to [Atlantic Capital / FSGI].



(d)The Shareholder shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, take any action to: (i) solicit,
initiate, propose, encourage, facilitate or induce any inquiries, discussions,
proposals, indications of interest, submissions or announcements of, any
Company Takeover Proposal, or take any other action to encourage, facilitate
or assist any inquiries or discussions, or the making of any proposal,
indication of interest, submission or announcement, in each case, that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover
Proposal, (ii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement, (iii) participate or
engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Takeover
Proposal, (iv) furnish to any Person (other than [Atlantic Capital / FSGI], or
any Representative of [Atlantic Capital / FSGI]) any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or afford to any
Person (other than [Atlantic Capital / FSGI] and any Representative of
[Atlantic Capital / FSGI]) access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, or the Shareholder (to the extent related to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), in any such case, which could reasonably
be expected to induce the making, proposal, submission or announcement of, or
could reasonably be expected to initiate, encourage, facilitate or assist, a
Takeover Proposal with respect to the Company or any inquiries or discussions,
or the making of any proposal, indication of interest, submission





Exhibit D - Page 2 or announcement, in any such case, which could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Takeover Proposal with respect to the Company, or (v) otherwise take any
action with the primary purpose of facilitating an effort or attempt by any
Person to make such a Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Shareholder shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 2(d) by the Shareholder. Each Shareholder shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and
other communications with any Person (other than [Atlantic Capital / FSGI] and
its affiliates) conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal with respect to the Company.



(e)The Shareholder shall not issue any press release or make any other public
statement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Merger), without
the prior written consent of [Atlantic Capital / FSGI] (which consent may not
be unreasonably withheld), provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Shareholder from engaging in non-public communication with
any person to the extent such communication does not involve the transmission
of material non-public information relating to the Merger Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated thereby.



(f)This Section 2 shall apply to Shareholder solely in his capacity as a
stockholder of the Company, and nothing in this Agreement shall in any way
restrict or limit the Shareholder or any of its Representatives, employees or
Affiliates who are directors or officers of the Company from taking (or
omitting to take) any action in such Person's capacity as a director or
officer of the Company, including in exercising rights under the Merger
Agreement, or pursuant to such Person's fiduciary duties under applicable law
as a director or officer of the Company, as determined by such Person in good
faith; and no such action or omission shall be deemed a breach of this
Agreement.

Section 3. Restrictive Covenants.



(a)From the date of this Agreement to a period of one year after the Closing
Date, the Shareholder agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, for any
reason, for his own account, or on behalf of, or together with or through, any
other Person:



(i) serve as a director of any Person providing products or services that are
competitive with those provided by the Company, [Atlantic Capital / FSGI], the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, including
without limitation FSGBank or its successor in interest (collectively, the
"Corporate Group"), within a radius of twenty (20) miles from each office
maintained by any member of the Corporate Group as of the Closing Date;



(ii) solicit, or attempt to solicit, any customer or employee of any member of
the Corporate Group who is a customer or employee of any member of the
Corporate Group on the Closing Date, for the benefit of any Person providing
products or services that are competitive with those provided by any member of
the Corporate Group; and







Exhibit D - Page 3 (iii) publish or communicate in any public forum any comments or statements
(whether written or oral) that denigrate or disparage, or are detrimental to,
the reputation of any member of the Corporate Group or any of its businesses
or any of its employees, directors or officers.



(b)Confidential Information. The Shareholder hereby agrees that for a period
of one year from the date that such Shareholder ceases to be a director of a
member of the Corporate Group, the Shareholder shall (i) keep strictly
confidential and not disclose to any Person not employed by any member of the
Corporate Group any Confidential Information of the Corporate Group; and (ii)
not use personally or for any other Person any Confidential Information,
provided, that nothing herein shall preclude the Shareholder from: (x) the use
or disclosure of information known generally to the public (other than
information known generally to the public as a result of the Shareholder's
violation of this section) or (y) any disclosure required by law or court
order so long as the Shareholder provides the Corporate Group prompt advance
written notice of any potential disclosure under this subsection. As used
herein, the term "Confidential Information" means all information not
generally known or available in the marketplace that was furnished to,
obtained by or created by the Shareholder in his capacity as a director or
officer of any member of the Corporate Group. Confidential Information
includes, by way of illustration, such information relating to: (i) any member
of the Corporate Group's customers, including customer lists, contact
information, contractual terms and information regarding products or services
provided to such customer; (ii) any member of the Corporate Group's finances,
including nonpublic financial statements, balance sheets, sales data,
forecasts and cost analyses; (iii) any member of the Corporate Group's plans
and projections related to growth, new products and services, and potential
sales/acquisitions; and (iv) any member of the Corporate Group's pricing and
fee strategies, operating processes, legal affairs, lending and credit
information, commission structure, personnel matters, loan portfolios,
contracts, services, products and operating results.



(c)Although the parties have, in good faith, used their best efforts to make
the provisions of this Section 3 reasonable in terms of geographic area,
duration and scope of restricted activities in light of the Corporate Group's
business activities, and it is not anticipated, nor is it intended, by any
party hereto that a court of competent jurisdiction would find it necessary to
reform the provisions hereof to make them reasonable in terms of geographic
area, duration or otherwise, the parties understand and agree that if a court
of competent jurisdiction determines it necessary to reform the scope of this
Section 3 or any part thereof in order to make it binding and enforceable,
such provision shall be considered divisible in all respects and such lesser
scope as any such court shall determine to be reasonable shall be effective,
binding and enforceable.



(d)Because of the difficulty in measuring economic losses that may be incurred
by the Corporate Group as a result of any breach by the Shareholder of any of
the covenants contained in this Section 3, and because of the immediate and
irreparable damage that would be caused for which the Corporate Group would
have no other adequate remedy, the Shareholder agrees that any member of the
Corporate Group may enforce the provisions of this Section 3, by any
applicable equitable or legal means, including by injunction or restraining
order against the Shareholder if the Shareholder breaches or threatens to
breach any provisions of this Section 3.



Section 4. Reserved.







Exhibit D - Page 4 Section 5. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest of
(a) the Closing Date, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, (c) the date of any material modification, waiver
or amendment of the Merger Agreement entered into without Shareholder's
consent, and (d) March [●], 2016; provided, that any termination of this
Agreement shall not affect the liability of any party for breach of any
provision of this Agreement prior to such termination, and, provided, further,
that the rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to Sections 3, and 7
hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement if the Merger is
consummated pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.

Section 6. Additional Matters. The Shareholder and [Atlantic Capital / FSGI]
shall, from time to time, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, such additional or further consents, documents and other

illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the

of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby brought by any party hereto, and (b)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject

in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action or proceeding is
improper, or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any such courts.

(i) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE

C.As a condition for [Atlantic Capital / FSGI] to consummate the Merger and

/ FSGI] has requested that the Shareholder enter into this Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:



Section 1. Representations and Warranties. The Shareholder hereby represents
and warrants to [Atlantic Capital / FSGI] as follows:



(a) Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. The Shareholder has all requisite
power and authority to execute this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by the
Shareholder of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the Shareholder. The Shareholder has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and, assuming its due authorization, execution and delivery by
[Atlantic Capital / FSGI], this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in
accordance with its terms. The execution and delivery by the Shareholder of
this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,





Exhibit E - Page 1 cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon the Covered Shares
under, any provision of any agreement (including any organizational document
of the Shareholder) to which the Shareholder is a party or by which the
Covered Shares are bound or, subject to the filings and other matters referred
to in the next sentence, any provision of any law or judicial, regulatory or
other administrative order or decree applicable to the Shareholder or the
Covered Shares. No consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with,
any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect
to the Shareholder in connection with the execution, delivery and performance

(b) Covered Shares. The Shareholder is the record or Beneficial Owner of and
has good and marketable title to, the Covered Shares free and clear of all
Liens. The Shareholder does not Beneficially Own, or own of record, any equity

not appointed or granted any proxy or similar agreement inconsistent with this
Agreement, which appointment or grant is still effective, with respect to the

securities Beneficially Owned by its Affiliates or any group of which such
Person or any such Affiliate is or becomes a member. The terms "Beneficially
Own", "Beneficially Owned" and "Beneficial Ownership" shall have correlative
meanings to "Beneficial Owner".

Section 2. Voting Covenants. The Shareholder covenants and agrees as follows:

(a)At any meeting of the stockholders of the Company called to seek the [FSGI
/ Atlantic Capital] Shareholder Approval (the "Shareholder Approval") or in
any other circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval
(including by written consent) for the purpose of approving the Merger
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger [and the amendment to the Atlantic Capital articles of incorporation],
and any actions that would reasonably be considered to be in furtherance
thereof, is sought (collectively, the "Covered Actions"), the Shareholder
shall, (i) if a meeting is held, appear at such meeting or otherwise cause the
Covered Shares to be counted as present at such meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum, and (ii) vote (or cause to be voted) the Covered
Shares, as applicable, in favor of the Covered Actions. The Shareholder
represents that any proxies heretofore given in respect of the Covered Shares
that may still be in effect are not irrevocable, and such proxies are hereby
revoked.

thereof or in any other circumstances upon which the Shareholder's vote,

including the Merger), (ii) any Takeover Proposal (including any Superior
Proposal) with respect to the Company, and (iii) any other proposal or
transaction involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary, which amendment

transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, or change in any
manner the voting rights of any class of capital stock of the Company. The
Shareholder shall not commit or agree to take any action inconsistent with the
foregoing.

(iii). This Section 2(d) shall not prohibit a Transfer to an Affiliate of the
Shareholder, provided that, as a precondition to such Transfer, [(x)] the
transferee agrees in writing, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
[Atlantic Capital / FSGI], to be bound by all terms of this Agreement, and (y)
such Transfer, in the reasonable opinion of [Atlantic Capital / FSGI], shall
not require [Atlantic Capital / FSGI] to amend any filings or disclosures that
it has made pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, or any other
law, rule or regulation applicable to [Atlantic Capital / FSGI].

[Atlantic Capital / FSGI]) access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, or the Shareholder (to the extent related to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), in any such case, which could reasonably
be expected to induce the making, proposal, submission or announcement of, or
could reasonably be expected to initiate, encourage, facilitate or assist, a
Takeover Proposal with respect to the Company or any inquiries or discussions,
or the making of any proposal, indication of interest, submission or
announcement, in any such case, which could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Takeover Proposal

purpose of facilitating an effort or attempt by any Person to make such a

Section 2(e) by the Shareholder. Each Shareholder shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Person (other than [Atlantic Capital / FSGI] and its Affiliates)

officer of the Company, including in exercising rights under the Merger
Agreement, or pursuant to such Person's fiduciary duties under applicable law
