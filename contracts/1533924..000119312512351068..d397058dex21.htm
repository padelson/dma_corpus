Section 3.31 _Investment Representations_.

 

(a) _Experience; Status_.

(i) Seller has substantial experience in analyzing and investing in companies
like Parent and is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in Parent and has the capacity to protect its own interests. To
the extent necessary, Seller has retained, at its own expense, and relied
upon, appropriate professional advice regarding the investment, tax and legal
merits and consequences of an investment in the Preferred Shares that
Seller will receive at Closing and the Common Shares issuable upon conversion
of such Preferred Shares.

(ii) Seller is an "accredited investor" (as such term is used in Rule 501
under the Securities Act), is able to bear the economic risk of its investment
in the Preferred Shares and the Common Shares indefinitely and has sufficient
net worth to sustain a loss of its entire investment in Parent without
economic hardship if such loss should occur.

 



32 (b) _Access to Information._

 

(i) Seller has had an opportunity to discuss Parents business, management and
financial affairs with the members of Parents management and has had the
opportunity to review Parents operations and facilities. Seller has also had
an opportunity to ask questions of the officers of Parent, which questions
were answered to its satisfaction. Seller acknowledges that it is familiar
with the nature of Parents business. Seller has received and had an
opportunity to read the Reports.

(ii) Seller has not received representations or warranties from Parent or
Buyer, or their employees, affiliates, attorneys, accountants or agents,
except as set forth in this Agreement and has undertaken such due diligence
pertaining to Parent and Buyer as Seller deems adequate. Seller has, as of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, no Knowledge of any fact that
results in the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Buyer or
Parent given hereunder.

 

(iii) Seller understands that the ownership of the Preferred Shares and the
Common Shares involves numerous risks, including those described under the
heading "Risk Factors" in Parents filings with the SEC.

(c) _Investment Purposes_. 

(i) Seller is acquiring the Preferred Shares and the Common Shares issuable
upon conversion of such Preferred Shares solely for investment for its own
account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with the view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in any transaction in violation of
the securities Laws of the United States of America or any state. Seller
understands that the Preferred Shares and the Common Shares issuable upon
conversion of such Preferred Shares have not been registered under the
Securities Act or applicable state securities laws by reason of a specific
exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, the availability of which depends upon,
among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the
accuracy of Sellers representations as expressed herein. Seller understands
that Parent is relying, in part, upon the representations and warranties
contained in this _Section 3.31_ for the purpose of determining whether this
transaction meets the requirements for such exemptions.

(ii) Seller acknowledges and understands that it must bear the economic risk
of its investment in the Preferred Shares and the Common Shares issuable upon
conversion of such Preferred Shares for an indefinite period of time because
such Preferred Shares and such Common Shares must be held indefinitely unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws or unless an exemption from such registration is available.

(iii) Seller understands that any transfer agent of Parent will be issued
stop transfer instructions with respect to the Preferred Shares and the Common
Shares unless such transfer is subsequently registered under the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption from such
registration is available.

 



33 Section 3.32 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Seller is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement with respect
to any individuals who are employed by Seller or an Affiliate who provide
services related to the Assets.

(b) Neither Seller nor any trade or business, whether or not incorporated,
that together with Seller would be deemed a "controlled group" within the
meaning of Section 4001 of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" _ERISA_ ") or Section 414 of the Code has any liability (or has
within the past six (6) years) had any liability (including any contingent
liability under Section 4204 of ERISA) with respect to any plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA that would be, or could be reasonably expected to become, a
Liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (" _Title IV Liability_ ").

35 (b) As of the Execution Date, Buyer represents that, as of the date it was
filed with the SEC, each Report (i) complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (ii) did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

subsequent filings with the SEC prior to the Execution Date. As of the

presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity
included in or incorporated by reference into the Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders equity, as the

balance sheet of Parent and its subsidiaries included in the most recent
Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement that includes such a balance
sheet, including all notes thereto, as of the date of such balance sheet,
neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations
of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would
be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a balance sheet of
Parent or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied, other than liabilities or
obligations which do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.7 _Claims, Disputes and Litigation_. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to Buyers Knowledge,
threatened in writing against Buyer that would prevent the consummation by
Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Operative

business. In making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein, subject to the express
provisions of this Agreement, Buyer (i) has relied on its own
independent investigation and evaluation of the Assets and (ii) has
undertaken such due diligence pertaining to the Assets as Buyer deems
adequate. Buyer has, as of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, no
Knowledge of any fact that results in the breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of Seller given hereunder.

 



36 Section 4.10 _Financing_. The financing of the Cash Purchase Price will
consist of debt financing provided to Parent and/or Buyer, which may consist
of proceeds from a loan or the sale of debt securities (the " _Financing_ ").
Buyer has delivered to Seller true and complete copies of fully executed
commitment letters pursuant to which certain of the parties named therein
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set
forth therein for the purposes of funding the Cash Purchase Price at Closing
(the " _Commitment Letter_ "). As of the Execution Date, the Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, the other parties
thereto, the financing commitments thereunder have not been withdrawn or
terminated, and the Commitment Letter has not been amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified in any respect. No event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Buyer or Parent (as applicable) under any term of the Commitment
Letter. Buyer has no reason to believe that it or any of the other parties to
the Commitment Letter will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of the Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it. Buyer has
no reason to believe that any portion of the Financing to be made thereunder
will otherwise not be available to Buyer on a timely basis to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and its Affiliates are not required
to pay any fees or other amounts to the Financing Sources in connection with
the Financing prior to the execution of this Agreement, except those fees and
other amounts which Buyer and its Affiliates have paid in full as of the
Execution Date. The obligations of the other parties to the Commitment Letter
to fund the full amount of the Financing to Buyer pursuant to the terms of the
Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions other than the conditions
set forth in the Commitment Letter. There are no side contracts or
understandings (other than for customary fee letters and engagement letters)
related to the Financing under the Commitment Letter other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letter. At the Closing, Buyer will have readily
available funds that are sufficient to pay the Cash Purchase Price on the
terms contemplated hereby.

Shares_.

the issuance of the Preferred Shares in connection therewith, the Preferred
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date (or earlier termination of

_Section 5.2_ and the obtaining of any required Consents, including Consents
of operators of the Assets (which Consents Seller shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain), Seller will give Buyer, its Affiliates and its
and their respective officers, employees, agents, accountants, attorneys,
investment bankers and other authorized representatives (collectively, "
_Buyer s Representatives_") reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the offices, Records and Assets of Seller, for purposes of conducting
Buyers title and environmental due diligence with respect to the Assets. All
investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or any of Buyers
Representatives shall (i) be conducted at Buyers sole cost, risk and
expense, in such manner so as not to interfere with the conduct of the
business of Seller and, to the extent so requested by Seller, under the
supervision of a representative of Seller and (ii) not be conducted without
prior notice to, and approval of, Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall not (A) have access to personnel records of Seller relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information, the disclosure of which, in Sellers reasonable opinion, could
subject Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of the other Seller Subject
Parties to risk of liability (unless such information is sufficiently redacted
in order to allow such disclosure) without prior written consent of Seller or
(B) have access to any information if doing so could violate any Related
Contract or Law to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party or is
subject or which such Person believes in good faith could jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, neither Buyer nor any of Buyers Representatives shall have
access to, or shall be permitted to conduct, any environmental due
diligence (including any Phase I environmental property assessments) with
respect to any Asset where Seller does not have the authority to grant access
to such Persons for such due diligence; _provided, however_ that Seller shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require the payment
of any monies by Seller) to obtain such access for such Persons with respect
to any such Asset.

(b) Before conducting any sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive
investigation activities (" _Invasive Activities_ ") on or with respect to any
of the Assets, Buyer shall (i) based on Buyers conduct of Phase I
environmental property assessments with respect thereto, have a reasonable
belief that such Asset is affected by an Environmental Condition, (ii) furnish
Seller with a written description of (A) the basis for Buyers reasonable
belief that such Asset is affected by an Environmental Condition and (B) the
proposed scope of the Invasive Activities to be conducted, including a
description of the activities to be conducted, and a description of the
approximate location and expected timing of such activities and (iii) obtain
the prior written consent of Seller (which consent may be withheld by Seller
in its sole and absolute discretion) to undertake such Invasive Activities;
_provided_ , _however_ that if Seller does not give its written consent to
undertake such Invasive Activities within three days, then Buyer may, in its
sole discretion, within three days of notice of such nonconsent or expiration
of the three-day period referred to above, elect to remove the Asset with
respect to which Buyer so proposed to conduct such Invasive Activities from
the Assets being conveyed by Seller to Buyer at Closing pursuant hereto, in
which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value thereof.

 



40 (c) Buyer shall coordinate its environmental property assessments, physical
inspections of the Assets and other due diligence activity with Seller and
(if applicable) all third party operators of the Assets to minimize any
inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by such Persons.
Buyer shall, and shall cause all of Buyers Representatives to, abide by
Sellers and any third party operators, as applicable, safety rules,
regulations and operating policies while conducting its due diligence
evaluation of the Assets, including any environmental or other inspection or
assessment of the Assets. Buyer hereby releases, indemnifies, defends and
holds harmless each of the operators of the Assets and the Seller Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Liabilities arising out of,
resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental property
assessment or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any of
Buyers Representatives with respect to the Assets, including entry by Buyer
or any of Buyers Representatives into the offices of Seller, EVEN IF SUCH
LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY THIRD PARTY OPERATOR OR ANY
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM
THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH THIRD PARTY OPERATOR OR
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

 

(d) Buyer agrees to promptly (and in any event no less than forty-eight (48)
hours after their receipt or creation), provide Seller with copies of all
final reports and test results prepared by Buyer or any of Buyers
Representatives that contain data collected or generated from Buyers due
diligence with respect to the Assets (including all environmental and
title reports). Seller shall not be deemed by its receipt of said documents
or otherwise to have made any representation or warranty, expressed, implied
or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets or to the accuracy of said
documents or the information contained therein.

(e) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense (i) repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with Buyers
due diligence, (ii) restore the Assets to the approximate same or better
condition than they were prior to commencement of Buyers due diligence
and (iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the

warranty as to the accuracy of any information provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.2_, and Buyer may not rely on the accuracy of any such
information, in each case, other than as expressly set forth in the

will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreements dated as of May 1, 2012 and
July 23, 2012 between Eagle Energy of Oklahoma, LLC and Parent (the "

41 Section 5.3 _Return or Destruction of Information._ In the event of
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of _Article
XI_, Buyer shall promptly, and in any event, with five (5) days after such
termination, return or cause to be returned to Seller, or, at Buyers option,
destroy or cause to be destroyed (in which case, promptly after such

Seller that such destruction has occurred), all documents and other materials
obtained from or on behalf of Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall keep confidential any such information, all in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements.

Section 5.4 _Notification of Breaches._ Until the Closing (or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of _Article
XI_):

 

(a) Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to notify Seller promptly after Buyer
obtains Knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in
this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any
material respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to
be performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has
not been so performed or observed in any material respect. Following receipt
of such notice, Seller shall use its reasonably best efforts to cure such
condition or perform such covenant or agreement; _provided, however ¸_ that
the failure to so cure or perform pursuant to this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall
not be taken into account in determining whether the condition in _Section
6.2(b)_ has been satisfied; _provided further_ , that the breach or
nonperformance indentified in any notice provided pursuant to this _Section
5.4(a)_ shall be taking into account for all other purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Seller shall use reasonable efforts to notify Buyer promptly after Seller
obtains Knowledge that any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in
this Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any
material respect as of Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date has not been so
performed or observed in any material respect. Following receipt of such
notice, Buyer shall use its reasonably best efforts to cure such condition or
perform such covenant or agreement; _provided, however ¸ _that the failure to
so cure or perform pursuant to this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall not be taken into
account in determining whether the condition in _Section 6.1(b)_ has been
satisfied; _provided further_ , that the breach or nonperformance identified
in any notice provided pursuant to this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall be taking
into account for all other purposes of this Agreement.

Section 5.5 _Disclosure Schedules._ From time to time up to the earlier of
the date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article XI_, each Party shall have
the right to supplement or amend the Schedules attached hereto (other than
_Schedule 5.1_) that it has delivered to disclose any matter that (a) of
which such Party did not have Knowledge on the Execution Date after reasonable
due diligence with respect thereto or (b) arises subsequent to the Execution
Date, which fact shall be certified by an officer of such Party. To the
extent, in the aggregate, that any such supplements and/or amendments result
in a Seller Material Adverse Effect (in the case of supplements
and/or amendments by Seller) or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect (in the case
of supplements and/or amendments by Buyer), such supplements and/or amendments
shall not have the effect of modifying this Agreement for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections
6.2(a)_ and _6.2(b)_ (in the case of supplements and/or amendments by Seller)
or in _Sections 6.1(a)_ and _6.1(b)_ (in the case of supplements and/or
amendments by Buyer), but shall have the effect of modifying this Agreement
for all other purposes (including for purposes of _Article X_). To the
extent, in the aggregate, that any such supplements and/or amendments that
relate to clause (b) of the first sentence of this _Section 5.5_ do not

 



42  result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect (in the case of supplements
and/or amendments by Seller) or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect (in the case
of supplements and/or amendments by Buyer), such supplements and/or
amendments shall have the effect of modifying this Agreement for all purposes
(including for purposes of _Articles VI_ and _X_ ). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any supplements and/or amendments to the Schedules as a result of
any action taken or not taken in accordance with _Section 5.1_ shall not be
taken into consideration in determining whether a Seller Material Adverse
Effect has occurred.

 

 __Section 5.6 _Tax Matters._

(a) _Transfer Taxes._ All excise, sales, use, purchase, stamp, transfer,
documentary, filing, registration, recordation, value added and other similar
Taxes and fees, if any, that are imposed on or with respect to the purchase
and sale of the Assets (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne
solely by Buyer. The Parties shall cooperate to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party in connection with the qualification for, and
obtainment of, any exemption with respect to Transfer Taxes.

(b) _Property Taxes and Income Taxes._ Until the first (1st) anniversary of
the Closing, except to the extent already taken into account by the Parties in
the determination of the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, Seller shall retain
responsibility for, pay, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
from and against (i) all Property Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
ownership and operation of the Assets for any Tax period, or portion thereof,
ending on or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) Income Taxes of Seller and
its Affiliates. Except to the extent already taken into account by the Parties
in the determination of the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, Buyer shall be
responsible for, pay, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
and all of the other Seller Subject Parties from and against all Taxes other
than those that are the responsibility of Seller according to the preceding
sentence. For purposes of allocating Property Taxes to any portion of a
Tax period under this _Section 5.6(b)_, (A) in the case of Property Taxes
that are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a
transactional basis such as severance or production taxes, such allocation
will be made using a closing of the books method as if the Tax period ended
immediately prior to the end of the Effective Time, and (B) in the case of any
other Property Taxes, such Taxes will be allocated pro-rata based on the
number of days in the relevant portion of the Tax period before or after the
Effective Time, as compared to the number of days in the entire Tax period.
For purposes of clause (A) of the preceding sentence, any exemption,
deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall
be allocated pro rata per day based on the number of days in the relevant
portion of the Tax period as compared to the number of days in the entire Tax
period. To the extent the actual amount of Taxes is not determinable
at Closing (or when the Final Settlement Statement is determined), Buyer and
Seller shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the
amount of Property Taxes for purposes of _Sections 2.2(c)(i)(C)_,
_2.2(c)(ii)(C)_ ,  _2.3_ and _2.5_.

(c) _Tax Cooperation._ The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
another Partys request) the provision of records and information that are
relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. The Parties agree that the Preferred Shares are properly classified
as common stock under Section 305 of the Code and agree to report consistently
with such treatment on all Tax Returns and in any audit, litigation or other
proceeding, except to the extent that, as a result of a change in applicable
circumstances or Law, different treatment is required by applicable Law.
Further, Buyer agrees that it will not withhold any tax on any
dividends (whether actual or deemed) made on the Preferred Shares provided
that the holder of the Preferred Shares provides Buyer with a properly
executed IRS Form W-9.

 



43 (d) _Refunds_. Each Party shall be entitled to any refund, credit, or offset
with respect to Taxes for which such Party is responsible under this _Section
5.6_. If a Party receives a refund, credit, or offset to which the other Party
is entitled, the Party receiving the refund, credit, or offset shall pay an
amount of cash equal to the value thereof to the Party entitled to the
refund, credit, or offset within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt.

Section 5.7 _Governmental Bonds and Third Party Deposits._ Buyer understands
and acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters of credit, guarantees and
deposits posted by (or on behalf of) Seller with any Governmental Authorities
or any other Third Parties and relating to the Assets, other than those for
which an adjustment to the Purchase Price is made pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_ or _2.5_ , are transferable to Buyer. At the Closing, Buyer shall
cause all of the bonds, letters of credit, guarantees and deposits described
on _Schedule 5.7_ to be returned to Seller.

Section 5.8 _Financing._

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause Parent and its subsidiaries to, use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter, when applicable, any
Alternative Financing Commitment or, when applicable, the Commitment Letter
or Alternative Financing Commitment, each as amended, modified or replaced in
accordance with the Financing Modification Requirements (collectively, the "
_Financing Commitment_ "), including using all commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Financing Commitment and to negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitment or on other terms no less
favorable to Buyer, (ii) to satisfy (or cause Parent and its subsidiaries to
satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions in such definitive agreements, (iii)
subject to the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitment,
to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iv) to comply with
its obligations under the Financing Commitment and (v) to cause the Persons
providing the Financing to fund the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitment on the Closing Date (including by enforcing its rights under the
Financing Commitment). Buyer shall deliver to Seller true and complete copies
of all agreements (other than any fee letters and engagement letters) pursuant
to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide Buyer
with any portion of the Financing. Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice upon
becoming aware of any material breach by any party to the Financing Commitment
or any termination of the Financing Commitment. Buyer shall refrain (and
shall cause its subsidiaries to refrain) from taking, directly or indirectly,
any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of
the conditions contained in the Financing Commitment or in any
definitive agreement related to the Financing. Buyer shall not agree, without
Sellers prior written consent, to or permit any replacement, amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, all or
a portion of the Financing Commitment if such replacement, amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver (1) reduces the aggregate amount of the
Financing Commitment, (2) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
amends, expands or modifies any of the conditions to the Financing in any
respect that could make such conditions less likely to be satisfied before the
Closing or that would expand the possible circumstances under which such
conditions would not be satisfied by the Closing Date, (3) can reasonably be
expected to delay the Closing or the date on which the Financing would be
obtained or (4) could adversely impact the ability of Buyer and its Affiliates
to enforce their rights against other parties to the Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing (the " _Financing
Modification Requirements_ "). In the event

 



44  that the Buyer becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes
procurement of any portion of the Financing unlikely to occur in the manner or
from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letters, Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to arrange as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than one day prior to the
Closing Date, any such portion from alternative debt financing sources, on
terms and conditions consistent with the Financing Modification Requirements
(any such alternative financing actually obtained by Buyer, an " _Alternative
Financing Commitment_ "). Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a current basis
of the status of its efforts to obtain the Financing, provide Seller with
copies of all documents related to the Financing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, if Buyers inability to consummate the Financing
is attributable to Sellers failure to comply with its obligations under
_Sections 5.8(b)(i)_ and _(c)(i)_ , then, for all purposes under this
Agreement, Buyer shall not be deemed in breach of the covenant in this 
_Section 5.8(a)_, the representations in _Section 4.10_ or the covenant in
_Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ with respect to the Cash Purchase Price.

(b) _Seller Financial Statements._

(i) Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer,
as soon as practicable but not later than August 24, 2012, an audited balance
sheet of Seller as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and audited statements of
income, changes in members equity and cash flows for each of the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (or since inception, if earlier)
(collectively, the " _Initial Seller Audited Financial Statements_ ") and an
unaudited balance sheet of Seller as of June 30, 2012 and statements of
income and cash flows as of and for the year-to-date periods ended June 30,
2012 and 2011 (collectively, the " _Seller Unaudited Financial Statements_ ").
The Initial Seller Audited Financial Statements and the Seller Unaudited
Financial Statements shall comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC,
and Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
independent registered public accountants to perform a SAS 100 review of the
Seller Unaudited Financial Statements.

(ii) Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
to Buyer, as soon as practicable but not later than the sixtieth (60th) day
after Closing, an audited balance sheet of Seller as of September 30, 2012 and
audited statements of income, changes in members equity and cash flows for
the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and unaudited statements of income,
changes in members equity and cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2011 (collectively, the " _2012 Seller Audited Financial Statements_ ,"
and together with the Initial Seller Audited Financial Statements and the
Seller Unaudited Financial Statements, the " _Seller Financial Statements_ ").
The 2012 Seller Audited Financial Statements shall comply with the rules and
regulations of the SEC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2012 Seller Audited
Financial Statements shall include an audit opinion only if required by the
SEC. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist any auditor of
the 2012 Seller Audited Financial Statements in the completion of such audit,
including assistance in performing any required independence procedures.

(c) From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Affiliates, subsidiaries, auditors, engineers,
representatives and advisors to, provide such reasonable cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer and that is customary in connection with
financings comparable to the Financing, including: (i) using
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) furnish to Buyer and its Financing
Sources, as promptly as practicable all financial, business and other
pertinent information, comfort letters, certificates and other materials
reasonably required by Buyer for Buyer to produce the financial statements
and other offering document information to consummate the Financing, including
all financial statements (including, on a timely basis, appropriate unaudited
financial statements and related managements discussion and analysis and
summary and selected financial statements), pro forma financial statements,
financial and other data and information, including a description of the
business, of

 



45  the type and in the form required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act and of type and in the form customarily included in an
offering memorandum under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and (information
required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i) and _Section 5.8(b)(i)_,
the " _Required Information_ ") and (B) providing Buyer and its
representatives with reasonable access to the representatives, employees,
properties and Books and Records of Seller and its subsidiaries or other
cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the preparation
of such financial statements; _provided, however_ , that such financial
statements (including the preparation thereof) shall be the responsibility of
Buyer; (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to make senior management,
representatives and advisors of Seller available to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings, conference calls, presentations, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and other in person sessions with prospective
lenders, investors and rating agencies in connection with the Financing,
including through a customary "road show"; (iii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to assist with the preparation of (A) an offering
memorandum, bank information memoranda, private placement memoranda and
similar documents and other marketing materials, including "roadshow" or
investor meeting slides to be used in connection with the Financing (including
requesting any consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Financing and the delivery of one or more customary
representation letters) and (B) materials for rating agency presentations;
(iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Buyer and the
Financing Sources for any portion of the Financing (including
using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any syndication efforts
benefit materially from the existing lending relationships of the Seller); (v)
using commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of Assets in
connection with the Financing and the Buyers current financing arrangements;
(vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort
letters and legal opinions reasonably requested by Buyer; (vii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Financing Sources all
documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities with
respect to Seller under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation the PATRIOT
Act; (viii) taking corporate actions in connection with the Closing reasonably
necessary to permit the completion of the Financing; and (ix) facilitating the
execution and delivery (at the Closing) of definitive documents related to
the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer; _provided_ , _however_
, that none of Seller or its Affiliates, shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection
with the Financing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse
Seller for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including outside attorneys
fees) incurred by Seller, in connection with the cooperation contemplated
by this _Section 5.8(c)_. All non-public information provided from one Party
or its representatives to the other Party or its representatives pursuant to
this _Section 5.8(c)_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyer shall be permitted to
disclose such information regarding the Seller to potential lenders, investors
or their respective agents, advisors or other representatives in connection
with the Financing. Seller hereby consents to the reasonable use of its logos
in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are not used in a
manner that is reasonably likely to harm or disparage Seller or its marks. To
the extent practicable, Seller and its representatives shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written materials,
documents or memoranda to be presented at any meetings conducted in connection
with the Financing, and Buyer shall give due consideration to any comments
proposed by Seller and its representatives. Buyer shall reimburse Seller and
its Affiliates for all out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in performing
its obligations under Sections 5.8(b), 5.8(c) and 5.9. Nothing in this 
_Section 5.8(c)_ shall require any cooperation or other action by Seller to
the extent such cooperation or action would interfere unreasonably with
Sellers business and operations.

 



46 Section 5.9 _Schedule 14C._

 

 __(a) Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to file with the
SEC a preliminary Schedule 14C relating to the issuance of the Preferred
Shares as promptly as practicable following receipt of the Seller Financial
Statements and mail to Parents stockholders a definitive Schedule 14C
relating to the issuance of the Preferred Shares as permissible under the
rules and regulations of the SEC and the guidance of the staff of the SEC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Buyers inability to
prepare or file the Schedule 14C or receive SEC approval of the Schedule 14C
is attributable to Sellers failure to deliver information in accordance with
_Sections 5.8(b)_ and _5.9(b)_ , then, for all purposes under this Agreement,
Buyer shall not be deemed in breach of the covenant in this  _Section
5.9(a)_. __

(b) From the Execution Date until the date on which the Preferred Shares
become convertible pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations,
Seller shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Affiliates, subsidiaries, auditors, engineers, representatives and advisors
to, provide such cooperation and information as may be reasonably requested
by Buyer in connection with the preparation, filing and SEC review of the
Schedule 14C.

Section 5.10 _No Solicitation_. __ During the Exclusivity Period, Seller shall
not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or
their representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a) encourage, solicit,
initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal,
(b) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information
to, any Person (other than as permitted under this Agreement and other than
to Buyer or any of its Affiliates and/or its or their respective
representatives) concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal or (c) enter into
any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. Sellers shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates and all of its and their
representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions and negotiations with any Persons (other than Buyer and/or its
Affiliates) with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.
For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer and/or any of
its Affiliates) relating to the direct or indirect disposition, whether by
sale, merger or otherwise (other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) of all
or any portion of Seller or the Assets. Seller shall promptly, and in any
case within three (3) Business Days after receipt thereof, advise Buyer orally
and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or discussion that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
of such Acquisition Proposal, request or discussion, and identity of the
Persons involved. __

 

Section 5.11 _Employment Offers._

(a) Attached as _Schedule 5.11_ is a list of all of Sellers (and/or Eagle
Energy Operating Company LLCs) field employees who provide services related
to the Assets (the " _Field Employees_ "). _Schedule 5.11_ includes the
title, base compensation (hourly wage rate or annual salary), total annual
compensation (including incentive and similar compensation), vacation time,
and benefits Seller (or its Affiliates) provides to each Field Employee,
including a description of the benefits under the Sellers (and/or Eagle
Energy Operating Company LLCs) severance plan(s) and eligibility therefor
(the " _Seller Severance Benefits_ "). No later than twenty (20) days prior
to Closing, Buyer will make offers to each Field Employee that include base
compensation and benefits at least substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the base compensation and benefits stated in  _Schedule 5.11_ for each
Field Employee (it being understood and agreed by the Parties that the
foregoing shall not require Buyer to offer the Field Employees the benefits
described in number 6 on _Schedule 5.11_ ) and will offer
incentive compensation and other employee benefits comparable to similarly
situated new hires of Buyer. Such offers (i) will

 



47  require each Field Employee to accept the offer within ten (10) days of the
offer being communicated to such Field Employee, (ii) will be conditioned on
such Field Employee passing Buyers standard pre-employment screening and
(iii) employment with Buyer will commence with, and be conditioned on, the
occurrence of Closing. Those Field Employees who accept Buyers offer and
commence employment with Seller will become " _Transferred Field Employees_."
Buyer will maintain the base compensation of the Transferred Field Employees
at least equal to the compensation provided in the Buyers offer of employment
to the Field Employees for at least six (6) months following Closing. If
Buyer terminates a Transferred Field Employee within six (6) months following
the Closing and such termination would have qualified the terminated
Transferred Field Employee to severance pay under either Sellerss (or its
Affiliates) or Buyers severance plans, Buyer will provide to such terminated
Transferred Field Employee severance pay under the Seller Severance Benefits
or Buyers severance plans, whichever is greater.

(b) Buyer may conduct discussions and negotiations with other employees of the
Seller and its Affiliates with regard to employment by Buyer, and Seller will
take commercially reasonable efforts to make its employees available to
representatives of Buyer. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall constitute (i) an obligation of Buyer to maintain the
employment of any particular employee of Seller or its Affiliates, (ii) an
amendment or modification to, or be construed as amending or modifying, any
benefit plan, program or agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by Buyer or shall limit the right of the Buyer to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any such benefit plan, program or agreement. No employee of
Seller or its Affiliates is intended to be a beneficiary of the provisions of
this  _Section 5.11_.

(c) Other than the specific obligations with respect to Field Employees
outlined in  _Section 5.11(a)_ and, except as provided in the TSA, Buyer
will not assume, and Seller agrees to retain sole responsibility for and to
fulfill, perform, pay and discharge (or cause to be fulfilled, performed, paid
and discharged) all obligations and Liabilities, known or unknown, including
any Title IV Liability, with respect to the compensation arrangements and
employee benefit plans of Seller and its Affiliates, and all other liabilities
with respect to the employees of Seller or its Affiliates relating to periods
prior to Closing and, with respect to any employee of Seller or its Affiliates
who is not a Transferred Field Employee or otherwise hired by Buyer, except as
provided in the TSA, relating to any time period, whether before or after
Closing.

Section 5.12 _Parent Interim Covenants._ Except as required by any
Governmental Authority or Law and except as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, from and after the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of _Article XI_, unless Seller shall otherwise consent in writing
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, do any of the following: 

(a) acquire by merging or consolidating with, by purchasing a substantial
equity interest in or a substantial portion of the assets of or by any other
manner, any business, corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof if such transaction would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) adopt or propose to adopt any amendments to its charter documents that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



48 (c) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution payable in
cash, capital stock, property or otherwise with respect to any of its equity
interests; split, combine or reclassify any of its equity interests; or
combine or reclassify any of its equity interests;

 

(d) authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of
any class or series of stock of Parent ranking senior to or on parity with
the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of
dividends, redemption or the distribution of assets upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of Parent;

 

(e) take any of the actions described in Section 4(c) of the Certificate of
Designations; or

 

(f) take or agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions precluded
by the foregoing provision of this  _Section 5.12_.

Section 5.13 _Maintenance of Common Shares Reserved for Issuance_. From and
after the date hereof until there are no Preferred Shares outstanding, Parent
shall at all times reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Common Shares
for issuance upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares.

 

Section 5.14 _Hedges_. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
novate any hedges relating to the Assets and in effect on the Closing Date
and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Seller in connection therewith; provided that all costs, expenses and fees of
Buyer and Seller and each of their respective Affiliates, agents
and representatives associated with any such novation shall be borne by
Buyer.

Section 5.15 _HSR Act_. If Seller believes that issuance or delivery of any
Common Shares upon any conversion of Preferred Shares hereunder held by Seller
would require filings with or the approval of any governmental authority under
the HSR Act, or any other U.S. federal or state antitrust laws or
requirements (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), Seller may notify Buyer of such
requirement, and shall state in such notice whether Seller intends to make a
filing under the HSR Act. Within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of
any such notification from Seller that informs Buyer that Seller intends to
make a filing under the HSR Act (the "HSR Filing"), Buyer and Seller shall
each prepare and file with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission the notification and report form required with respect to such
conversion by the HSR Act, and request early termination of the waiting period
thereunder. In connection with the HSR Filing, Seller and Buyer shall respond
promptly to any inquiries from the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission concerning such filings and shall comply in all material respects
with the filing requirements of the HSR Act. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
with each other and, subject to the terms of any applicable confidentiality
agreements, shall promptly furnish all information to the other party that is
necessary in connection with such parties compliance with the HSR Act in
connection with the HSR Filing; _provided, however,_ that to the extent
provision of such information requires the participation or cooperation of a
third party non-Affiliate of Seller or Buyer, as applicable, Seller and Buyer
shall only be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
information. Seller and Buyer shall keep each other fully advised with respect
to any requests from or communications with the Department of Justice or the
Federal Trade Commission concerning the HSR Filing filings and shall consult
with each other with respect to all responses thereto. Seller and Buyer shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably
necessary in connection with the HSR Act or any other

 



49  applicable Antitrust Law in order to cause any applicable waiting period to
expire and any other required related governmental approval to be obtained in
connection with the conversion of Preferred Shares. Seller shall be
responsible for paying the fees due in connection with any HSR Filing and
shall reimburse Buyer and its Affiliates for all out of pocket costs and
expenses incurred in making any such filing and for otherwise performing its

ARTICLE VIII

 

TITLE MATTERS

Section 8.1 _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_.
Except for the Buyers remedies for breach by Seller of _Section 5.1_
(collectively, the " _Title Liabilities_ "), Seller makes no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement, the Assignment or any other Operative Document, with respect to
Sellers title to any of the Assets, and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees
that, except for the Title Liabilities, Buyers sole and exclusive remedy for
any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the
Assets (other than any Title Liabilities) shall be as set forth in this
_Article VIII_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for
the Title Liabilities, (i) the provisions of _Article X_ shall not apply with
respect to any defect in title (including any Title Defect) to any of the
Assets or any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant relating to
or affecting title (including any Title Defect) to any of the Assets, (ii)
this _Article VIII_ shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be the
exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Title Defects or other
deficiency in title to any Asset and (iii) except as provided in this _Article
VIII_, Buyer releases, remises and forever discharges Seller, its Affiliates
and all of the other Seller Subject Parties from any and all Claims
whatsoever, whether in law or in equity, known or unknown, or otherwise, which
Buyer might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising out
of, any Title Defect or other deficiency in title to any Asset.

Section 8.2 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_. 

(a) _Title Defect Notices._ On or before the Title Defect Claim Date, Buyer
may deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this _Section
8.2(a)_ (collectively the " _Title Defect Notices_ ," and each individually a
" _Title Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters which, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to
assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this _Article VIII_. For all purposes of
this Agreement, except as provided in _Section 8.1_, but otherwise
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to
have waived, and neither Seller, its Affiliates nor any of the other Seller
Subject Parties shall have any liability for, any Title Defect that Buyer
fails to assert as a Title Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by Seller
on or before the Title Defect Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect
Notice shall be in writing, and shall include (i) a description of the alleged
Title Defect(s), (ii) a description of the Asset(s) affected by the Title
Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents available to Buyer reasonably
necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s)
and (v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of
each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the
computations upon which Buyers belief is based. 

(b) _Title Benefit Notices._ Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Title Defect Claim Date a
notice setting forth any matters that in Sellers reasonable opinion
constitute Title Benefits and which Seller intends to assert as Title Benefits
pursuant to this 

 



54   _Article VIII_ (each, a " _Title Benefit Notice_ "). For all purposes of
this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller
shall be deemed to have waived, and Buyer shall have no liability for, any
Title Benefit that Seller fails to assert as a Title Benefit by a Title
Benefit Notice received by Buyer on or before the Title Defect Claim Date. To
be effective, each Title Benefit Notice shall be in writing and shall include
(i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit, (ii) the Asset(s) affected by
the Title Benefit (each a " _Title Benefit Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Benefit Property, (iv) supporting documents available to
Seller reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Benefit and (v) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property is increased by the Title
Benefit and the computations upon which Sellers belief is based.

(c) _Seller s Right to Cure._ Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to the
date that is one-hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing (the " _Cure
Period_ "), any Title Defects of which it has timely received a Title Defect
Notice from Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that if after pursuit of other
remedies reasonably available to Seller to cure any such Title Defect, Seller
reasonably believes that such Title Defect can be cured through a quiet title
or similar proceeding, then the Cure Period with respect to such Title Defect
shall be extended to the lesser of the conclusion of such proceeding or
eighteen (18) months following Sellers receipt of a Title Defect Notice with
respect thereto, notwithstanding Sellers previous attempt to cure such Title
Defect without the use of a quiet title or similar proceeding, so long as
Seller, at its sole cost and expense, initiates the quiet title or similar
proceeding on or before the end of the Cure Period and diligently pursues such
proceeding.

(d) _Remedies for Title Defects._ Subject to Sellers continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted by Buyer with respect thereto, in the event that any Title Defect
timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 8.2(a)_ is not waived
in writing by Buyer or cured on or before the Closing Date, then, subject to
the provisions of _Section 8.2(h)_, Seller shall, at its sole option, elect
to:

 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by an amount determined pursuant to _Section
8.2(f)_ as being the value of such Title Defect Amount;

(ii) exercise its right to attempt to cure (in whole or in part) the Title
Defect pursuant to  _Section 8.2(c)_;

(iii) retain the entirety of the Well, Future Well or Undeveloped Leases (and
the related Assets), as the case may be, that is adversely affected by such
Title Defect if the Title Defect Amount asserted by Buyer with respect thereto
is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the Allocated Value of the Well, Future
Well or Undeveloped Leases (and the related Assets), in which event, (A) if
this election is made prior to the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property, such Title Defect Property shall not be assigned by Seller
to Buyer at Closing and such Title Defect Property shall no longer be included
within the definition of Assets for any purpose under this Agreement and (B)
if this election is made following the Closing, then Seller and Buyer shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Title Dispute Escrow
Amount, a number of Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation Preference
equal to the Title Defect Amount previously asserted by Buyer with respect to
such Title Defect Property ( _less_ an amount equal to the net proceeds
received by Buyer with respect to such Title Defect Property) and Buyer shall
assign such Title Defect Property to Seller (pursuant to an assignment
substantially in the form of the Assignment) contemporaneously with the
releases of such Preferred Shares from escrow; or

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(d)_.

 



55 (e) _Remedies for Title Benefits._ Title Benefit Amounts finally determined
in accordance with _Section 8.2(g)_ or _8.2(i)_ , as applicable, may be used
exclusively to offset Title Defect Amounts that exceed the Individual Title
Defect Threshold in accordance with _Section 8.2(h)(ii)_.

 

(f) _Title Defect Amount._ The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title
Defect shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and
shall be determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree in writing on the Title Defect Amount, then that
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual Net
Acres for any Undeveloped Lease and (B) the Net Acres for such Undeveloped
Lease stated on _Exhibit A_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product obtained by multiplying the Allocated Value for such Undeveloped Lease
set forth on _Exhibit A_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Acre decrease for such Undeveloped Lease and the denominator which is the Net
Acres for such Undeveloped Lease stated on _Exhibit A_; _provided_ that if
the Title Defect does not affect such Undeveloped Lease throughout the life
of such Undeveloped Lease, then the Title Defect Amount determined under this
_Section 8.2(f)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable
time period only;

 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers Net
Revenue Interest for any Well or Future Well, as applicable, and (B) the Net
Revenue Interest set forth on _Exhibit A_ for such Well or Future Well, as
applicable, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of (x) the
Allocated Value of such Well or Future Well, as applicable, _multiplied by_
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the absolute value of such Net
Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth on _Exhibit A_ for such Well or Future Well, as
applicable; _provided_ that if the decreased Net Revenue Interest does not
affect the Well or Future Well, as applicable, throughout the life of the Well
or Future Well, as applicable, then the Title Defect Amount determined under
this _Section 8.2(f)(iv)_ shall be reduced to take into account the
applicable time period only;

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title with respect to the Title Defect Property of a type not
described above, then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking
into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of
the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of
the Title Defect, the economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the
Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and
Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Title Defect is reasonably
capable of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the
lesser of (A) the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect and
(B) the Allocated Value attributable to the Title Defect Property;

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs, losses or amounts included in
another Title Defect Amount pertaining to such Title Defect Property
hereunder; and

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article VIII_,
the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects under this _Article VIII_, upon any Title Defect Property, shall not
exceed the Allocated Value attributable to such Title Defect Property.

 



56 (g) _Title Benefit Amount._ The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit
Property is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit and
shall be determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree in writing on the Title Benefit Amount, then
that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the actual Net
Acres for any Undeveloped Lease and (B) the Net Acres for such Undeveloped
Lease stated on _Exhibit A_, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the
product obtained by multiplying the Allocated Value for such Undeveloped Lease
set forth on _Exhibit A_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Acre increase for such Undeveloped Lease and the denominator of which is the
Net Acres for such Undeveloped Lease stated on _Exhibit A_; _provided_ that
if the Title Benefit does not affect such Undeveloped Lease throughout the
life of such Undeveloped Lease, then the Title Benefit Amount determined under
this _Section 8.2(g)(ii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the
applicable time period only;

 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers Net
Revenue Interest for any Well or Future Well, as applicable, and (B) the Net
Revenue Interest set forth on _Exhibit A_ for such Well or Future Well, as
applicable, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of (x) the
Allocated Value of such Well or Future Well, as applicable, _multiplied by_
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the absolute value of such Net
Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth on _Exhibit A_ for such Well or Future Well, as
applicable; _provided_ that if the increased Net Revenue Interest does not
affect the Well or Future Well, as applicable, throughout the life of the Well
or Future Well, as applicable, then the Title Benefit determined under this
_Section 8.2(g)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable
time period only;

(iv) if the Title Benefit with respect to the Title Benefit Property is of a
type not described above, the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by
taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the
portion of the Title Benefit Property affected by the Title Benefit, the
legal effect of the Title Benefit, the economic effect of the Title Benefit
over the life of the Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title
Benefit by Buyer and Seller and such other reasonable factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation; and

(v) The Title Benefit Amount with respect to a Title Benefit Property shall
be determined without duplication of any benefit included in another Title
Benefit Amount pertaining to such Title Benefit Property.

(h) _Limits on Liability for Title Benefit and Title Defects._

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price (or any other
remedies provided) under this Agreement in respect of Title Defects, and
neither Seller (nor any of the other Seller Subject Parties) shall be
responsible for any individual Title Defect, (i) for which the Title Defect
Amount does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the " _Individual
Title Defect Threshold_ ") and (ii) for any Title Defect exceeding the
Individual Title Defect Threshold unless, and subject to _Section
8.2(h)(iii)_, (A) the sum of (1) all Title Defect Amounts (excluding any Title
Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller or with respect
to which Seller elects to cure pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_) that each
individually exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold, (2) all Remediation
Amounts that each individually exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold
and (3) all Buyer Losses (excluding the Buyer _De Minimis_ Liabilities)
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, exceeds (B) the Buyer Basket, after
which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other remedies hereunder only with respect to Title Defects that are
attributable to such Title Defect Amounts in excess of the Buyer Basket but
that do not exceed the Title Dispute Escrow Amount.

 



57 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall there be any remedies provided under this Agreement in respect
of Title Benefits, and neither Buyer (nor any of the other Buyer Subject
Parties) shall be responsible for any individual Title Benefit, (i) for which
the Title Benefit Amount does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000)
(the " _Individual Title Benefit Threshold_ ") and (ii) for any Title Benefit
exceeding the Individual Title Benefit Threshold unless, and subject to
_Section 8.2(h)(iii)_, the sum of all Title Benefit Amounts that each
individually exceed the Individual Title Benefit Threshold exceeds the Buyer
Basket, after which point Seller shall be entitled to remedies hereunder only
with respect to Title Benefits that are attributable to such Title Benefit
Amounts in excess the Buyer Basket.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the amount of any Title Benefit Amounts with respect to which Seller
is entitled to a remedy pursuant to _Section 8.2(h)(ii)_ shall be credited
against any Title Defect Amounts with respect to which Buyer is entitled to a
remedy pursuant to _Section 8.2(h)(i)_. In the event the aggregate amount of
any Title Benefit Amounts with respect to which Seller is entitled to a remedy
pursuant to _Section 8.2(h)(ii)_ (A) equals or exceeds the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts with respect to which Buyer is entitled to a remedy pursuant to
_Section 8.2(h)(i)_, neither Party shall be entitled to any adjustment to the
Purchase Price (or any other remedy hereunder) with respect to any Title
Defect Amounts or Title Benefit Amounts and (B) is less than the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts with respect to which Buyer is entitled to a remedy
pursuant to _Section 8.2(h)(i)_, except to the extent of the offset
against Title Defect Amounts described in the first sentence of this _Section
8.2(h)(iii)_, Seller shall not be entitled to any adjustment to the Purchase
Price (or any other remedy hereunder) with respect thereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, neither Buyer nor Seller shall
have any remedy under this Agreement with respect to any Title Defect or Title
Benefit, as applicable, in excess of the Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit
Amount claimed by it in the Title Defect Notice or Title Benefit Notice
submitted by it to the other Party pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ or _8.2(b)_ ,
as applicable.

(i) _Title Dispute Resolution._ Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts
no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If Seller
and Buyer fail to agree in writing by such time, each Title Defect, Title
Benefit, Title Defect Amount and Title Benefit Amount in dispute shall be
exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this  _Section 8.2(i)_. There
shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney experienced in oil
and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Title
Defect Properties are located (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). The Title
Arbitrator shall be selected by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Closing Date, and absent such
agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the AAA. The place of arbitration
shall be Houston, Texas and the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance
with the Rules, to the extent such Rules do not conflict with the terms of
this _Article VIII_. In addition to being bound by and adhering to the Rules
and practices of the AAA and Law on arbitrator neutrality, the Title
Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or outside counsel for any
Party or its Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding the
arbitration or have any financial interest in the dispute. The Title
Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after the
closing of the hearing and shall be final and binding upon both Parties,
without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator
shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Article VIII_ and the Rules.
The Title Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Title Defect
Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in the applicable Title
Defect Notice, nor a lower Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount

 



58  proposed by Seller in its response to such Title Defect Notice, and may not
award Seller a greater Title Benefit Amount than the Title Benefit Amount
claimed by Seller in the applicable Title Benefit Notice or a lower Title
Benefit Amount proposed by Buyer in response to the Title Benefit Notice. The
Title Arbitrator shall determine the specific disputed Title Defect, Title
Benefit, Title Defect Amount and/or Title Benefit Amount that is the subject
of the arbitration and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
Party with respect to any other matter. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear
its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller and Buyer
shall each bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.
Within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to
Buyer and Seller of any award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a Title
Benefit Amount, to the extent such Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit
Amount would otherwise be required to be paid by one Party to the other Party
pursuant to the terms of this _Article VIII_, Buyer shall pay to Seller the
awarded Title Benefit Amount and, in the case of Title Defect Amounts, Seller
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Title Dispute Escrow
Amount to Buyer an amount of Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation
Preference equal to the awarded Title Defect Amount. If the Title Defect
Amount ultimately determined by the Title Arbitrator or the Parties with
respect to the Title Defect is less than the Title Defect Amount claimed by
Buyer in the Title Defect Notice applicable thereto, then within
the aforesaid ten (10) day period, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to release to Seller from the Title Dispute Escrow Amount a
number of Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to
the amount by which the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in the
applicable Title Defect Notice exceeds such awarded Title Defect Amount.

(j)  _Recourse Against Escrowed Funds._

(i) Buyer, on behalf of itself and all other Buyer Indemnified Parties,
acknowledges and agrees that the Title Dispute Escrow Amount shall be the
sole and exclusive source of satisfaction of all (and neither Seller nor its
Affiliates nor any other Seller Subject Parties shall under any circumstance
have any personal liability or obligation for the satisfaction of any) (A)
Title Defects properly asserted by Buyer (and with respect to which, after
giving effect to the provisions of this _Article VIII_ Buyer is entitled to a
remedy) pursuant to this  _Article VIII_ and (B) breaches by Seller of
_Article VIII_ (collectively, " _Title Matters_ "). The Title Dispute Escrow
Amount shall be used solely to satisfy Title Matters or will be released to
Seller in accordance with this _Section 8.2(j)_.

(ii) The aggregate liability of Seller to Buyer in connection with all
Title Matters shall in no event exceed the Title Dispute Escrow Amount then
held in escrow under the Escrow Agreement and Buyer, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each other Buyer Indemnified Party, hereby covenants forever not to
assert, file, prosecute, commence, institute (or sponsor or facilitate any
Person in connection with the foregoing), any complaint or lawsuit or any
legal, equitable, arbitral or administrative proceeding of any nature, against
Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of the other Seller Subject parties in
connection with or relating to any Title Matters. If Buyer asserts a Title
Defect claim under this _Article VIII_, Buyer shall, subject to the
limitations on Sellers liability hereunder, be entitled to be paid the Title
Defect Amount determined in accordance with _Section 8.2(f)_, solely by
receiving from the Escrow Agent all or a portion of the then available Title
Dispute Escrow Amount in an amount equal to such Title Defect Amount (to be
comprised by an amount of Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation
Preference equal to the awarded Title Defect Amount). After such time as the
Title Dispute Escrow Amount is exhausted or released from escrow, Buyer
shall have no recourse against Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of the
other Seller Subject Parties in respect of any Title Matters or for any
unsatisfied Title Defect Amounts.

(iii) If Buyer asserts a Title Defect claim under this _Article VIII_, Buyer
shall, subject to the limitations on Sellers liability hereunder, be entitled
to be paid the Title Defect Amount determined in accordance with _Section
8.2(f)_, solely by receiving from the Escrow Agent all or a portion of the
then available Title Dispute Escrow Amount in an amount equal to such Title
Defect Amount (such payment to be comprised of an amount of Preferred Shares
with an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the awarded Title Defect
Amount or, if less, the then remaining amount of the Title Dispute Escrow
Amount).

 



59 (iv) All (A) claims in respect of Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts
asserted properly and timely by Buyer in accordance with this Agreement prior
to the Title Defect Claim Date that become subject to dispute resolution in
accordance with _Section 8.2(i)_ and that are not resolved by the Title
Arbitrator or the Parties and satisfied by Seller (through releases from the
escrow of the Title Dispute Escrow Amount or title curative work), (B) Title
Defects which Seller has elected to attempt to cure pursuant to _Section
8.2(d)(ii)_ and for which Buyer contests the adequacy or completeness of the
cure (or the remaining Title Defect Amount (if any) then applicable after
taking into account the curative work) through arbitration in accordance with
_Section 8.2(j)(v)_ and (C) Title Defects which Seller has elected to
attempt to cure pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ and for which the Cure
Period has been extended beyond the applicable Escrow Release Date, shall be
deemed to be " _Pending Title Claims_ " to the extent and for so long as, as
of the applicable Escrow Release Date, any of the Escrow Amount remains in
escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and has not been released or
exhausted. The dollar amount of all Title Defect Amounts (not to exceed, with
respect to any alleged Title Defect included in any Pending Title Claim, the
Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in the Title Defect Notice applicable
thereto) claimed in good faith in respect of Pending Title Claims are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Pending Title Claim Amount_." On the first
(1st) Business Day following the Escrow Release Date, Buyer and Seller shall
jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written
instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to release and deliver to Seller
the then remaining balance of the Title Dispute Escrow Amount (and all
earnings thereon) in excess of the (if any) Pending Title Claim Amount. The
Pending Title Claim Amount will continue to be held in escrow by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement until such time as the
Pending Title Claims have been fully resolved in accordance with _Article
VIII_ ; _provided, however_ , if the remaining balance of the Title Dispute
Escrow Amount at any time or from time to time thereafter exceeds the then
remaining Pending Title Claim Amount, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly
notify the Escrow Agent in writing that the excess amount (in an amount
of Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to such
excess amount) shall be released promptly to Seller.

 

(v) All Title Defects which Seller has elected to attempt to cure pursuant to
_Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ for which Buyer disputes the adequacy or completeness
of the cure (or the remaining Title Defect Amount (if any) then applicable
after taking into account the curative work) shall be submitted to the Title
Arbitrator for resolution. In making his determination the Title Arbitrator
shall adhere to the applicable rules, procedures, process and provisions set
forth in _Section 8.2(i)_.

 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, a number of
Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the
portion of the Title Dispute Escrow Amount allocable to any Title Defect (or
the applicable portion thereof) with respect to which Seller elected to cure
pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)(ii)_ shall be released by the Escrow Agent to
Seller promptly after such Title Defect has been cured and at the request of
Seller, Buyer shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to release such number
of Preferred Shares to Seller.

 

Section 8.3 _Consents to Assign; Preferential Purchase Rights_.

 

(a) Prior to Closing, Seller shall send to each holder of a Consent set forth
in Part B of _Schedule 3.3_, a notice (in material compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such Consent) seeking such Persons
consent to the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to Closing, with
respect to each preferential purchase right, right of first refusal or
other similar right (each, a " _Preferential Purchase_

 



60   _Right_ ") pertaining to an Asset and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including those set forth on _Schedule 3.9_, Seller shall send to the holder
of each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material compliance with
the contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right.

(b) If, prior to the Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right
notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies, or if the time for exercising
such Preferential Purchase Right has not expired (each such Asset subject to
an exercised or outstanding Preferential Purchase Right at Closing, a " _Pref-
Right Asset_ "), then such Pref-Right Asset shall be excluded from the Assets
to be acquired by Buyer, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Pref-Right Asset. Seller shall be entitled to all
proceeds paid by a Person exercising a Preferential Purchase Right
with respect to a Pref-Right Asset. If the holder of a Preferential Purchase
Right applicable to a Pref-Right Asset thereafter fails to consummate the
purchase of such Pref-Right Asset on or before the date that is one hundred
twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (or the time for exercising such
Preferential Purchase Right expires without exercise by the holder thereof),
then Seller shall so notify Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, on or before that
date that is ten (10) days following its receipt of such notice of such
Preferential Purchase Right being waived or the time for exercising such right
has expired, such Pref-Right Asset from Seller, under the terms of this
Agreement, for a price equal to the Allocated Value of such Pref-Right Asset.

(c) All Assets with respect to which any Preferential Purchase Right
applicable thereto has been waived or as to which the period to exercise such
right has expired prior to the Closing shall (in each case) be included in the
Assets sold and conveyed to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement.

 

(d) If as of the Closing, Seller has not obtained a Consent set forth in Part
B of _Schedule 3.3_, and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (A)
the assignment of the Assets affected thereby to Buyer to be void and/or (B)
the termination of the Asset under the express terms thereof (each, a "
_Subject Consent Asset_ ") then such Subject Consent Asset shall be excluded
from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the excluded Asset. In the event
that a Consent with respect to a Subject Consent Asset that was not obtained
prior to the Closing Date is obtained within one hundred twenty (120) days
following the Closing Date then, within ten (10) days after such Consent is
obtained, Seller shall assign to Buyer such Subject Consent Asset pursuant to
an assignment in form and substance substantially similar to the Assignment,
effective as of the Effective Time, and Buyer shall pay to Seller, under the
terms of this Agreement, a price equal to the Allocated Value of such
Subject Consent Asset (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.6_). From and
after the Closing, until the earlier of the date that is one hundred twenty
(120) days after Closing and the date that any Consent applicable to a Subject
Consent Asset that has not been assigned to Buyer pursuant hereto is
obtained, Seller shall continue to use all commercially reasonable efforts (at
Buyers sole cost and expense) to obtain each such Consent. Except for any
Subject Consent Assets, all Assets subject to any Consent that is outstanding
as of the Closing shall be included in the Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing
and Buyer shall have no claim against (including no claim under this _Article
VIII_), and Seller shall have no liability for, its failure to obtain any
such Consent; _provided, however_ , that for ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, Seller will continue, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Consent of the holders
of such unsatisfied Consent, and thereafter will provide, at Buyers sole cost
and expense, such assistance as Buyer may reasonably require in connection
with Buyers efforts to secure the Consent. 

(e) If the Subject Consent Asset is a Contract, and Buyer is assigned the
other Assets to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not
transferred to Buyer due to the unattained Consent, Seller will continue after
Closing to use reasonable efforts to obtain such Consent, which the Parties
acknowledge and agree shall not require Seller to pay any monies for
which Buyer has not separately agreed in writing to reimburse Seller (or
otherwise be responsible) so that such Contract can be transferred to Buyer
upon the receipt of such Consent.

 



61 ARTICLE IX

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 9.1 _General Disclaimer of Environmental Warranties and
Representations._ Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 3.11_, Seller
makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
pursuant to this Agreement, the Assignment or any other Operative Document
with respect to compliance with or liabilities arising under or related to
Environmental Laws. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyers sole and
exclusive remedy for any Liabilities, Claims, Losses or obligations at law or
under any agreement (including under this Agreement), in each case, arising
under or related to (i) any Environmental Law, (ii) any alleged breach by
Seller of either any representation or warranty in  _Article III_ (other
than _Section 3.11_) or in any certification in the certificate delivered by
Seller to Buyer at Closing pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ or any covenants in
this Agreement, (iii) any Environmental Condition or (iv) any breach by
Seller of this _Article IX_ ((i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) collectively, the "
_Article IX Environmental Liabilities_ ") shall be as set forth in this
_Article IX_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the
contrary, (A) the provisions of _Article X_ shall not apply or afford any
remedy whatsoever with respect to any Article IX Environmental Liabilities and
(B) the provisions of this _Article IX_ , shall not limit or otherwise reduce
or modify any remedy of Buyer under _Article X_ with respect to any breach by
Seller of the representation and warranty set forth in _Section 3.11_. This 
_Article IX_ shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be the sole and
exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Article IX Environmental
Liabilities. Except as provided in this _Article IX_, Buyer
releases, remises and forever discharges Seller, its Affiliates and all of
the other Seller Subject Parties from any and all suits, legal or
administrative proceedings, Claims, demands, damages, losses, costs,
liabilities, interest or causes of Action whatsoever, in law or in equity,
known or unknown, which Buyer might now or subsequently may have, based on,
relating to or arising out of, any Article IX Environmental Liability.

 

Section 9.2 _Notice of Environmental Defects; Defect Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Environmental Defect Notices_. On or before the Environmental Defect
Claim Date, Buyer must deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the
requirements of this _Section 9.2(a)_ (as such notices may be amended or
supplemented until the Environmental Defect Claim Date, collectively, the "
_Environmental Defect Notices_ ," and each individually an " _Environmental
Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters which, in Buyers reasonable
opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as
an Environmental Defect pursuant to this  _Article IX_. Except with respect
to Buyers remedy under _Article X_ with respect to any breach by Seller of
the representation and warranty set forth in _Section 3.11_, for all purposes
of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and neither Seller,
any of the Seller Indemnified Parties nor any of the other Seller Subject
Parties, shall have any liability for any Environmental Defect that Buyer
fails to assert as an Environmental Defect by any Environmental Defect Notice
received by Seller on or before the Environmental Defect Claim Date. To be
effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall
include (i) a description of the matter constituting the
alleged Environmental Defect, (ii) a description of each Asset (or portion
thereof) that is affected by the alleged Environmental Defect, (iii) Buyers
reasonable assertion of the Allocated Value of the portion of the Assets
affected by the alleged Environmental Defect and (iv) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged
Environmental Defect. Each Environmental Defect Notice may include a
calculation of the Remediation 

 



62  Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer reasonably asserts is
attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyers calculation of the
Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe
in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the Environmental Condition
that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify all
assumptions used by Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount, including
the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with Environmental Laws
and all assumptions used to calculate the Lowest Cost Response.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article IX_, the
aggregate Remediation Amounts attributable to the effects of all
Environmental Defects under this _Article IX_ upon any Asset that is affected
by the alleged Environmental Defect shall not exceed the Allocated Value
attributable to such Asset. To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each
calendar week prior to the Environmental Defect Claim Date, written notice
(which shall not constitute an Environmental Defect Notice) of all
Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week,
which notice shall be preliminary in nature and may be supplemented prior to
the Environmental Defect Claim Date; _provided_ that failure to provide a
preliminary notice of an Environmental Defect shall not prejudice Buyers
right to assert such Environmental Defect in accordance with the terms
hereunder.

 

(b) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right
to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation
Amount asserted with respect thereto, in the event that any Environmental
Defect timely asserted by Buyer in an Environmental Defect Notice in
accordance with _Section 9.2(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or
reasonably cured on or before the Closing Date, then Seller shall, at its sole
option, elect (subject in each case, to the provisions of _Section 9.2(c)_)
to:

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Remediation Amount of
such Environmental Defect;

(ii) assume responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental Defect;
or

 

(iii) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(d)_.

 

If Seller elects the option set forth in _Section 9.2(b)(i)_, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for Remediation of such Environmental
Defect and all liabilities with respect thereto. If Seller elects the option
set forth in _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_, Seller shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to diligently implement such Remediation in a manner which
is consistent with the requirements of Environmental Laws and the Lowest Cost
Response for the type of Remediation that Seller elects to undertake and
Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to implement
such Remediation in a manner which is consistent with the requirements of
Environmental Laws, taking into consideration Buyers use and operation of the
Assets in a timely fashion for the type of Remediation Seller elects to
undertake, and, upon advance written notice, Buyer hereby grants Seller
reasonable access to the affected Assets after the Closing Date to implement
and complete such Remediation in accordance with the Access Agreement and
acknowledges that there shall be no reduction to the Purchase Price with
respect to such Environmental Defect. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in
its undertaking of any such work including by allowing use of necessary
utilities and other equipment at the location in question. Seller agrees to
bear its pro-rata share of any increase in Buyers costs of such utility that
are attributable to Sellers actions pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_. Upon
completion of Remediation, Seller shall promptly, at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to Buyer or its Affiliates, (1) close
all bore holes from its Remediation in accordance with recognized industry
standards, (2) repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with
the Remediation and (3) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought
onto the Assets in connection with the Remediation. Seller shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed

 



63  regarding any Remediation. In completing the Remediation, Seller shall
provide Buyer with draft copies of all documents to be submitted to any
Governmental Authorities regarding the Remediation and shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer to incorporate comments provided by it to Seller
regarding such documents. In addition, Seller shall promptly provide Buyer
with copies of any correspondence with any Governmental Authority regarding
the Remediation and shall provide Buyer with the opportunity to participate
in any meetings with any Governmental Authority regarding the Remediation.
Seller shall be solely responsible for obtaining any Permits associated with
the Remediation. Seller shall promptly remove any waste material generated
during the Remediation from the Assets. Seller shall require any contractors
or subcontractors entering the Assets in connection with the Remediation to
provide Buyer with certificates of insurance demonstrating coverage under
Commercial General Liability, Contractors Pollution Liability, and Errors and
Omissions Liability insurance policies in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and naming Buyer as an additional insured. With respect to
any provision of this _Article IX_ that refers to any Remediation completed
by Seller, Seller will be deemed to have adequately completed the Remediation
(A) upon receipt of a certificate of approval or completion from the
applicable Governmental Authority that the Remediation has been implemented
to the extent necessary to comply with existing Laws or (B) if no certificate
or approval is available under Environmental Law or upon express written
consent of Buyer, upon mutual agreement of the Parties, upon receipt of a
certificate from an independent, licensed professional engineer that the
Remediation has been implemented to the extent necessary to comply with
Environmental Laws; _provided_ that, if the Parties cannot agree, the issue
of whether the Remediation is completed shall be resolved by the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in _Section 9.2(d)_. If the Lowest Cost
Response requires the implementation of institutional controls, Buyer agrees
to accept all such controls and to cooperate with Seller by arranging for
prompt execution and recording of all legal instruments required to implement
the institutional controls.

 

(c) _Limits on Liability for Environmental Defects_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any remedies available to
Buyer under this Agreement in respect of Environmental Defects, and neither
Seller, any of its Affiliates nor any of the other Seller Subject Parties
shall be responsible for any individual Environmental Defect, for which the
Remediation Amount does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the "
_Individual Environmental Threshold_ ") and (ii) in no event shall there be
any remedies available to Buyer under this Agreement in respect
of Environmental Defects, and neither Seller, any of its Affiliates nor any
of the other Seller Subject Parties shall be responsible for any Environmental
Defect, for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental
Threshold (excluding any Remediation Amounts attributable to Environmental
Defects which Seller elects to remediate pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_),
unless (A) the sum of (1) all Title Defect Amounts (excluding any Title Defect
Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller or with regard to which
Seller elects to cure pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_) that each individually
exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold, (2) all Remediation Amounts that
each individually exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (excluding
any Remediation Amounts attributable to Environmental Defects which Seller
elects to remediate pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_) and (3) all Buyer
Losses (excluding the Buyer _De Minimis_ Liabilities) incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, exceeds (b) the Buyer Basket, after which point Buyer
shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
hereunder only with respect to Environmental Defects that are attributable to
such Environmental Defect Amounts in excess of the Buyer Basket but that do
not exceed the Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount. The Parties agree that if
the same Environmental Defect affects more than one Asset, then the
Remediation Amounts for each Asset affected by such Environmental Defect shall
be aggregated, without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Remediation Amount hereunder, for the purposes of determining whether the
Individual Environmental Threshold has been met with respect to such
Environmental Defect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, Buyer shall not have any remedy under this Agreement with respect to
any Environmental Defect in excess of the Remediation Amount claimed by it in
the Environmental Defect Notice submitted by it to the Seller pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_.

 



64 (d) _Environmental Dispute Resolution._

 

(i) Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Environmental Defects and
Remediation Amounts no later than the three (3) Business Days prior to
Closing. If Seller and Buyer fail to agree in writing by such time, the
Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall be
exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this _Section
9.2(d)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental
attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in environmental matters
involving oil and gas producing properties in the regional area in which the
affected Assets are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
Seller within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date, and absent such
agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the AAA (the " _Environmental
Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas
and shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules, to the extent such Rules
do not conflict with the terms of this _Article IX_. In addition to being
bound by and adhering to the Rules and practices of the AAA and applicable
law on arbitrator neutrality, the Environmental Arbitrator shall not have
worked as an employee or outside counsel for any Party or its Affiliates
during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or have any
financial interest in the dispute. The Environmental Arbitrators
determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the
matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without
right of appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator
shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Article IX_ and the Rules. The
Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Remediation
Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its Environmental
Defect Notice, nor a lower amount than the Remediation Amount proposed by
Seller in its response to such Environmental Defect Notice unless the
Arbitrator determines that the alleged Environmental Defect is not an
Environmental Defect within the meaning of this Agreement. The Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining
whether a disputed Environmental Defects exists and/or the appropriate
Remediation Amounts and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental
Arbitrator. Within ten (10) days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers
written notice to Buyer and Seller of any award with respect to a Remediation
Amount, and subject to this  _Section 9.2_, Seller shall direct the Escrow
Agent to release from the Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount an amount of
Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the amount,
if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. If the
Remediation Amount ultimately determined by the Environmental Arbitrator with
respect to any Environmental Defect is less than the Remediation Amount
claimed by Buyer in the applicable Environmental Defect Notice with respect
to such Environmental Defect, then within the aforesaid ten (10) day period,
Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Environmental
Dispute Escrow Amount to Seller a number of Preferred Shares with an
aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the amount by which the Remediation
Amount claimed by Buyer in the applicable Environmental Defect Notice exceeds
such Remediation Amount.

(ii) All Environmental Defects which Seller has elected to attempt to
remediate pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ for which Buyer disputes the
adequacy or completeness of the Remediation shall be submitted to the
Environmental Arbitrator for resolution. In making his determination the
Environmental Arbitrator shall adhere to the rules, procedures, process and
provisions set forth in _Section 9.2(d)(i)_.

 

(e) _Recourse Against Escrowed Funds._

(i) Buyer, on behalf of itself and all other Buyer Indemnified Parties,
acknowledges and agrees that the Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount shall be
the sole and exclusive source for satisfaction of all (and neither Seller,
its Affiliates nor any other Seller Subject Party shall under any

 



65  circumstance have any personal liability or obligation for the satisfaction
of any) (A) Environmental Defects timely asserted in an Environmental Defect
Notice delivered by Buyer to Seller in accordance with _Section 9.2(a)_ and
(B) Sellers breach of _Article IX_ (collectively, the " _Environmental
Matters_ "). The Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount shall be used solely to
satisfy Environmental Matters or will be released to Seller in accordance
with this _Article IX_.

(ii) The aggregate liability of Seller to Buyer in connection with all
Environmental Matters shall in no event exceed the Environmental Dispute
Escrow Amount and Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Buyer
Indemnified Party, hereby acknowledges and further covenants forever not to
assert, file, prosecute, commence, institute (or sponsor or purposely
facilitate any Person in connection with the foregoing), any complaint or
lawsuit or any legal, equitable, arbitral or administrative proceeding of
any nature, against Seller, its Affiliates or any of the other Seller Subject
Parties in connection with or relating to any Environmental Matters or any
other matter arising under any Environmental Law with respect to the operation
of the Assets on or before the Closing Date. After such time as the escrowed
Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount is exhausted or released from escrow,
Buyer shall have no recourse against Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of
the other Seller Subject Parties in respect of any Environmental Matters, for
any unsatisfied Remediation Amounts or Sellers breach of _Article IX_.

(iii) If a Buyer asserts a claim under this _Article IX_ for any
Environmental Matter prior to the Escrow Release Date, Buyer shall, subject to
the limitations on liability hereunder, be entitled to be paid the
Remediation Amount determined in accordance with _Section 9.2(d)_, solely by
receiving from the Escrow Agent an amount of the Environmental Dispute Escrow
Amount equal to such Remediation Amount (or, if less, the then remaining
amount of the Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount) (such payment to be
comprised of an amount of Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation
Preference equal to the Remediation Amount or, if less the then remaining
amount of the Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount).

(iv) All (A) claims in respect of Environmental Defects and Remediation
Amounts asserted properly and timely by Buyer in accordance with this
Agreement prior to the Environmental Defect Claim Date that become subject to
dispute resolution in accordance with _Section 9.2(d)_ and that are not
resolved by the Environmental Arbitrator or the Parties and satisfied by
Seller (through releases from the then escrowed Environmental Dispute Escrow
Amount) prior to the Escrow Release Date and (B) Environmental Defects for
which Seller has elected to assume responsibility for Remediation pursuant to
_Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ for which Buyer contests the adequacy or completeness of
the Remediation through arbitration in accordance with _Section 9.2(d)_ that
are not resolved and satisfied prior to the Escrow Release Date shall be
deemed to be " _Pending Environmental Claims_ " to the extent and for so long
as any of the Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount remains in escrow pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement. The aggregate dollar amount claimed in good faith in
respect of all Pending Environmental Claims is hereinafter referred to as the
" _Pending Environmental Claim Amount_ ". On the first (1st) Business Day
following the Escrow Release Date, Buyer and Seller shall jointly execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent
to release and deliver to Seller, the then remaining balance of the
Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount held in escrow (and all earnings thereon)
in excess of the (if any) the Pending Environmental Claim Amount. An amount of
the Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount equal to the Pending Environmental
Claim Amount will continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement until such time as the Pending
Environmental Claims have been fully resolved and Escrow Agreement shall be
deemed to be extended accordingly; _provided, however_ , if the remaining
balance of the Environmental Dispute Escrow Amount at any time or from time
thereafter exceeds the then remaining Pending Environmental Claim Amount, then
Seller and Buyer shall promptly notify the Escrow Agent in writing that the
excess amount (in an amount of Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation
Preference equal to such excess amount) shall be released promptly to Seller.

 



66 (f) _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances._ Buyer acknowledges that the Assets
have been used for exploration, development, and production of oil and gas
and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other substances
or materials located in, on or under the Assets or associated with the Assets.
Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or
other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of
wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells,
materials, and equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets may
contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing
material and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact
with various environmental media including water, soils or sediment. Special
procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation, or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and
other Hazardous Substances from the Assets.

 

ARTICLE X

 

ASSUMPTION; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 10.1 _Assumption by Buyer; Retained Obligations._

(a) Without limiting Buyers rights to indemnity under this _Article X_,
from and after the Closing, Buyer assumes and hereby agrees to fulfill,

indemnity statute relating to oilfield services and associated activities
shall not be applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated

(a) Promptly after receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller
Indemnified Party (and any other Seller Subject Parties) (hereinafter
collectively referred to as an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice by a third
party (including any Governmental Authority) of any Actions or the
commencement of any audit with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be
entitled to receive payment hereunder for any Buyer Losses or any Seller
Losses (as the case may be), Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall notify
Buyer

 



69  or Seller, as the case may be (in such capacity, Buyer or Seller are
hereinafter referred to as an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), of such Action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement with
respect to such Action or audit only if, and only to the extent that, the
defense of such Actions is prejudiced as a result of the failure to notify
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its
sole expense, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within
fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving such notice, to assume the defense
of such Action with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In the event, however, that the
Indemnifying Party declines or fails to (1) assume the defense of the Action
on the terms provided above or (2) employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, in any case within such fifteen (15) day period, then
such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in any
such Action and the Indemnifying Party will (subject to the other terms and
provisions of this Agreement) pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of
such counsel as incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any single Action.
For avoidance of doubt, the fees and disbursements of counsel of any Buyer
Indemnified Party in connection with a Buyer Loss shall be satisfied solely
by receiving from the Escrow Agent a portion of the General Escrow Amount in
an amount equal to such fees and disbursements. In any Action with respect to
which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such Action, will
have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at
such Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as
the case may be, will at all times use all commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) diligently conduct the defense of any Action for which they are
maintaining the defense and (ii) keep the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of
the defense of any Action the defense of which they are maintaining and to
cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any
such Action.

 

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless
(A) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release
of the Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out of such Claim, (B)
does not contain any admission or statement of any wrongdoing or liability on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party and (C) does not contain any equitable order,
judgment or term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with
the business of the Indemnifying Party or any of the Indemnifying Partys
Affiliates. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder unless (i) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Claim, (ii) does not contain any admission or statement of any
wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (iii) does not
contain any equitable order, judgment or term which in any manner affects,
restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of
the Indemnified Partys Affiliates.

(c) A Claim for indemnification by an Indemnified Party for any matter not
involving an Action by a third party may be asserted by written notice from
Buyer or Seller, as applicable, to the Indemnifying Party from whom
indemnification is sought. Such notice will specify with reasonable
specificity the basis for such Claim.

after the applicable Claims Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if, prior to the close

_Section 10.4_) by the other Party of a claim for indemnity hereunder and
such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of as of such
date and time, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis
for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in
accordance with the terms hereof.

set forth herein, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not assert a claim
against Seller for indemnification under _Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ or
_10.2(a)(iii)_ (other than, in the case of a claim for indemnification under

after Closing) for Buyer Losses unless the amount of such Buyer Losses exceeds

Title Defects cured by Seller or with respect to which Seller elects to cure
pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_) that each individually exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold, (ii) all Remediation Amounts that each
individually exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold and (iii) all
Buyer Losses (excluding the Buyer _De Minimis_ Liabilities) incurred by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, exceeds (b) an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the "
_Buyer Basket_ ") and then the recoverable Losses shall be limited to those
that exceed the Buyer Basket but that do not exceed the General Escrow Amount.

Section 10.7 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Recourse Against Escrowed Funds._

(a) From and after the Closing, other than the remedies set forth in _Articles
VIII_ and _IX_ , the remedies set forth in this _Article X_ shall provide the

or arising under this Agreement or any certificate delivered by one Party to
the other Party at Closing, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability,
other laws or otherwise (other than Claims arising from actual fraud),
including any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made herein or any other document contemplated herein or
delivered pursuant hereto. The Parties and Parent acknowledge and agree that
from and after the Closing the remedies available in this _Section 10.7_
supersede (and each Party and Parent waives and releases) any other remedies
available at law or in equity including rights of rescission, rights
of contribution and Claims arising under applicable statutes.

(b) Except with respect to Claims relating to, or arising from, Buyer Losses
that are subject to _Section 10.2(a)(iv)_ (collectively, the " _Section
10.2(a)(iv) Claims_ "), Buyer, on behalf of itself and all other Buyer
Indemnified Parties, acknowledges, agrees and covenants forever
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(i) after the Closing, the General Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive source of funds for satisfaction of all (and neither Seller, its
Affiliates nor any other Seller Subject Parties shall under any circumstance
have any personal liability or obligation for the satisfaction of any) Claims
by any Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses, Claims or otherwise under
_Section 10.2_, in connection with, arising out of or resulting from the
subject matter of this Agreement or any of the Operative Documents and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;

fully released, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek indemnity
under this Agreement or

 



72  otherwise and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any recourse against
Seller, any of its Affiliates or any other Seller Subject Parties for any
Claims, unpaid Losses or otherwise (including those set forth in _Section
10.2_) in connection with, arising out of or resulting from the subject matter
of this Agreement or any of the Operative Documents and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, none of Seller,
its Affiliates or any of the other Seller Subject Parties shall have any

_Article X_ during the Escrow Claims Period, the Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification by Seller in accordance with this
_Article X_ solely by receiving from the Escrow Agent all or a portion of the
Escrow Amount in an amount of Preferred Shares with an aggregate Liquidation
Preference equal to the amount of such indemnity claim.

 

(e) All Claims asserted by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article
X_ during the applicable Escrow Claims Period that are not resolved and
satisfied during such Escrow Claims Period (including the obligation to pay
any such indemnity claim) shall be deemed to be " _Pending Article X Claims_."
The dollar amount of all Losses claimed in good faith in respect of Pending
Article X Claims are hereinafter referred to as the " _Pending Article X Claim
Amount_."

 

(f) On the Escrow Release Date, Buyer and Seller shall jointly execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent
to release and deliver to Seller the remaining balance of the General Escrow
Amount (and all earnings thereon) in excess of the Pending Article X Claim
Amount (if any). From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Pending Article
X Claim Amount will continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement until all Pending Article X Claims have been
resolved by the Parties in writing or in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(a) by the mutual written agreement of the Parties;

(b) by either Party (the " _Terminating Party_ ") by giving written notice to
the other Party, if the other Party has breached (or is in breach) of this

entitled to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(b)_ if at the

with _Section 11.1_ because of a Willful and Material Breach by a Party that
constitutes a Closing Failure, the actual damages to be incurred by the
terminating Party can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of
liquidated damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such
damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure accurately.

Section 11.3 _Specific Performance._ The Parties each acknowledge that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, in the
event that any Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or
agreement made it in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may be without an
adequate remedy at law. The Parties agree, therefore, that in the event that
any Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement
made by such Party in this Agreement, any non-breaching Party may, subject to
the terms of this Agreement, institute and prosecute an Action to enforce
specific performance of such covenant or agreement, in addition to
pursuing any other remedy available at law or in equity.

 



76 Section 11.4 _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding the termination of this
Agreement or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary but
subject to the next sentence of this _Section 11.4_, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. If Closing of the transaction contemplated under the terms
of this Agreement occurs, the Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate
(which termination shall be effective as of Closing).

Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a
part of this Agreement as if set out in full in this Agreement.

Section 12.3 _Assignment; Successors in Interest_. No assignment or transfer
by any Party of its rights and obligations under this Agreement will be made
except with the prior written consent of the other Party; _provided, however,_
that without the consent of Seller but with notice to Seller, Buyer may,

this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, to an entity formed,
controlled and primarily owned by Buyer or Parent;  _provided further,_ that,

of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and any reference

78 Section 12.6 _Controlling Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of Texas without
reference to its choice of law rules.

 

 __Section 12.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc.; Waiver of Jury Trial._

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 2.5_, _8.2(i)_ and _9.2(d)_ , each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that any Action arising in connection
with any disagreement, dispute, controversy or Claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any related document (for purposes of this
_Section 12.7_, a " _Legal Dispute_ ") shall exclusively be brought in the
courts of the State of Texas, or the federal courts located in the Southern
District of the State of Texas. The Parties agree that, after a Legal Dispute
is before a court as specified in this _Section 12.7_ and during the
pendency of such Legal Dispute before such court, all Actions with respect to
such Legal Dispute, including any counterclaim, cross-claim or interpleader,
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court. Each of
the Parties hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any
Legal Dispute that it is not subject thereto or that such Action may not be
brought or is not maintainable in such court or that its property is exempt or
immune from execution or that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum
or that the venue of the Action is improper. Each Party agrees that a final
judgment in any Action described in this _Section 12.7_ after the expiration
of any period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay during appeal
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Laws.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 12.6_ or _12.7(a)_ to the contrary,
each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that it will not
bring or support any Action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
other Financing Commitment or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in New York County, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
federal courts located in the Southern District of New York (and appellate
courts thereof). The provisions of this _Section 12.7(b)_ shall be
enforceable by each Financing Source.

 

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE IRREVOCABLY ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL
BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR ANY DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR OTHERWISE RELATED HERETO,
INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING COMMITMENT
OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF.

 

Section 12.8 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction
will not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by Laws, the Parties waive any provision
of Laws which renders any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any
respect.

 



79 Section 12.9 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all
of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Facsimile
or scanned and emailed transmission of any signed original document or
retransmission of any signed facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission
will be deemed the same as delivery of an original. At the request of any
Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission
by signing a duplicate original document. 

Section 12.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (i) the right of the
Seller Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification pursuant to _Article X_,
(ii) the right of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification
pursuant to _Article X_ and (iii) the rights of the Financing Sources
pursuant to  _Sections 12.7(b)_, _12.7(c)_ , _12.11(c)_ and _12.17(b)_ and
this _Section 12.10_, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is
intended, or will be construed, to confer upon or give any Person other than
the Parties, and their successors or permitted assigns, any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, or result in
such Person being deemed a third party beneficiary of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , only Seller may bring a Claim under or with respect
to this Agreement on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties and only Buyer
may bring a Claim under or with respect to this Agreement on behalf of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties. 

Section 12.11 _Amendment; Waiver._

(a) Any amendment, extension or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by both Seller
and Buyer.

 

(b) A waiver by a Party of the performance of any covenant, agreement,
obligation, condition, representation or warranty will not be construed as a
waiver of any other covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation
or warranty. A waiver by any Party of the performance of any act will not
constitute a waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical
act required to be performed at a later time.

(c) The Parties hereby expressly agree that the provisions of  _Sections
12.7(b)_, _12.7(c)_ , _12.10_ and _12.17(b)_ and this _Section 12.11(c)_
shall not be amended in any manner adverse to the Financing Sources without
the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. 

Section 12.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreements and the documents executed pursuant to this Agreement supersede
all negotiations, agreements and understandings between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties.

 

Section 12.13 _Cooperation Following the Closing_. Following the Closing, each
of the Parties shall deliver to the others such further information and
documents and shall execute and deliver to the others such further instruments
and agreements as the other Party shall reasonably request to consummate or
confirm the transactions provided for in this Agreement, to accomplish the
purpose of this Agreement or to assure to the other Party the benefits of this
Agreement.

 



80 Section 12.14 _Transaction Costs._ Except as otherwise provided herein, each
Party and Parent will be responsible for its own legal fees and other
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution
or performance of this Agreement.

Section 12.15 _Construction._

(a) This Agreement has been freely and fairly negotiated between the Parties.
If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party because of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Any reference to any Law will
be deemed also to refer to such Law as amended, modified, succeeded or
supplemented from time to time and in effect at any given time, and all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The words "include," "includes," and "including" do not limit the
preceding terms or words and shall be deemed to be followed by "without
limitation." Pronouns in masculine, feminine and neuter genders will be
construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular form will be
construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context
otherwise requires. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "day"
and "days" mean and refer to calendar day(s). The words "this Agreement,"
"herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder," and words of similar import refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless
expressly so limited.

(b) The inclusion of any information in any Schedule shall not be deemed an
admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the
inclusion of such information in any Schedule, that such information is
required to be listed in any Schedule or that such items are material. The
headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Schedules are
inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a
part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Schedules are arranged in
sections corresponding to those contained in _Article III_ and _Article V_
merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of a
Schedule as an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be
deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other
representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to
such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such
item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of any
Schedule with respect to such other representations or warranties or the
presence or absence of a reference thereto in any Schedule or in the
particular representation or warranty.

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in any Schedule is not intended
and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the
materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties to determine whether any
obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any
Schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement (other than
with respect to any representation, warranty or provision of this Agreement
in which such specification occurs).

 



81 Section 12.16 _Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchange_. Seller and Buyer
hereby agree that Seller shall have the right at any time prior to completion
of all the transactions that are to occur at Closing to assign all or a
portion of its rights under this Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" (as
that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii) of the Treasury
Regulations) in order to accomplish the transaction in a manner that will
comply, either in whole or in part, with the requirements of a like-kind
exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code. Likewise, Buyer shall have the
right at any time prior to completion of all the transactions that are to
occur at Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement
to an "exchange accommodation titleholder" (as that term is defined in IRS
Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308) for the same purpose. If Seller
assigns all or any of its rights under this Agreement for this purpose, Buyer
agrees to (a) consent to Sellers assignment of their rights in this
Agreement, which assignment shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer
and (b) pay the Purchase Price (or a designated portion thereof as specified
by Sellers) into a qualified escrow or qualified trust account at Closing as
directed in writing. If Buyer assigns all or any of its rights under this
Agreement for this purpose, Seller agree to (i) consent to Buyers assignment
of its rights in this Agreement, which assignment shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Sellers, (ii) accept the Purchase Price from the
exchange accommodation titleholder at Closing and (iii) at Closing, convey and
assign the Assets (or any portion thereof) as directed by Buyer. Seller and
Buyer acknowledge and agree that any assignment of this Agreement (or any
rights hereunder) to a qualified intermediary or exchange accommodation
titleholder shall not release any Party from any of its respective liabilities
and obligations hereunder, and that neither Party represents to the other
Party that any particular tax treatment will be given to any Party as a result
thereof. The Party electing to assign all or any of its rights under this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 12.16_ shall defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless the other Party and its Affiliates from all Claims relating to such
election.

 

 __Section 12.17 _Non-Recourse._

(a) No past, present or future director, officer, employee, member, partner,
shareholder or other owner (whether direct or indirect), Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, all
such Persons, the " _Seller Subject Parties_ ") shall have any liability for
any obligations or liabilities of Seller under this Agreement or for any
Claims or Losses based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

(b) Subject to the rights of the parties to any Financing Commitment under
the terms thereof, none of the Parties, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, solely in their respective capacities as parties to this
Agreement, shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source,
solely in its capacity as a lender or arranger in connection with the
Financing, and the Financing Sources, solely in their respective capacities as
lenders or arrangers, shall not have any rights or claims against any Party or
any Person related to a Party hereto, in connection with this Agreement or
the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 

Section 12.18 _Excluded Losses_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or otherwise, in no event shall any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties be entitled under this Agreement
(including _Article X_) or otherwise to recover from Seller, any Affiliate of
Seller or any of the other Seller Subject Parties or Buyer, any Affiliate of
Buyer or any of the other Buyer Subject Parties, as applicable, and Buyer, on
behalf of each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each
of the Seller Indemnified Parties, waive any right to recover any
Excluded Losses. This _Section 12.18_ shall not restrict any Partys rights
under _Section 11.2_ or any Partys right to obtain specific performance.

 



82 Section 12.19 _Publicity_. Prior to the Closing, neither of the Parties nor
their Affiliates shall issue any press release or similar public announcement
pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), except where such release or announcement
is deemed in good faith by the releasing or disclosing Party to be required by
Law or under the rules and regulations of a recognized stock exchange on which
shares of such Party or any of its Affiliates are listed, so long as prior to
making any such release or announcement, the releasing or announcing Party
shall provide a copy of the portion of the release or public announcement
containing such information to the other Party;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in the case of any press release or public announcement to be issued or
made in connection with Closing, the Parties agree to reasonably cooperate in
advance of such issuance, announcement or public disclosure. 

Section 12.20 _Time of Essence_. This Agreement contains a number of dates and
times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties
intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final date and
time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes
any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to meet any
performance or exercise any rights by the election date applicable to it on
the basis that its late action constitutes substantial performance, to require
the other Party to show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds.
Without limiting the foregoing, time is of the essence in this Agreement. If
the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any
action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is
required to be given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a
Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and
the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be given
or action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.

Section 12.21 _Name Change_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the use
of the name "Eagle" and any variants thereof from the Assets, and, except with
respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no
right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any
of its Affiliates. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any direct or
indirect costs or expenses incurred by it in complying with the provisions of
this _Section 12.21_.
