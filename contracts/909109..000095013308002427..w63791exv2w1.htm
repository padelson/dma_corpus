aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments of the Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U><B>Exchange Fund</B></U>&#148;). The Paying
Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; <U>provided</U> that any and all such

three Business Days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent (x)&nbsp;to mail to each
holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates as provided in Section&nbsp;4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and
(ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section&nbsp;4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and (y)&nbsp;to mail to each holder of a Stock Award, a check in an amount due and
payable to such holder pursuant to the provisions of Section&nbsp;4.3. Upon surrender of a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section&nbsp;4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent
in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in
Section&nbsp;4.2(g)) equal to (x)&nbsp;the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section&nbsp;4.2(e)) multiplied by (y)&nbsp;the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
