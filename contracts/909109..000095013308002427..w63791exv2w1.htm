RECITALS  

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of the parties hereto has determined that it is in the best interests of such party and its shareholders and other constituencies to enter into this Agreement, and has approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Voting Agreements. 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement. 

   

 WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to constitute the plan of merger required by Section 1924 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the " _PBCL_ ") for the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the PBCL. 

   

 1.2. _Closing_.

    ##### 

  

    

the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall
be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day ending at
11:59 p.m. (Eastern U.S. Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on
which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York or
Tokyo. 

   

 1.3. _Effective Time_. Immediately after the Closing, the Company, Merger Sub and Parent will cause the Articles of Merger (the " _Pennsylvania Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed in the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as provided in Section 1927 of the PBCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Pennsylvania Articles of Merger have been duly filed in the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or at such other later date and time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the PBCL (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_

 2.1. _The Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), except that the articles of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as follows: The sentence "The aggregate number of shares which the corporation shall have authority to issue is 125,000,000 shares of Common Stock no par value, and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with a par value of $.01 per share." shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with "The aggregate number of shares, classes of shares and par value of shares which the corporation shall have authority to issue is 1000 shares of Common Stock with a par value of $1.00 per share." 

   

 2.2. _The By-Laws_. The by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _By-Laws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law. 

   

ARTICLE III  

  

 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_

Charter and the By-Laws. 

   

ARTICLE IV 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_ 
  _Exchange of Certificates_   

  

 4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company: 

   

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock, no par value per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (each, an " _Excluded Share_ ," and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $61.50 per Share (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration,_ " together with the amounts payable under this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.3 to the holders of the Stock Awards, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

   

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to a paying agent which is a U.S. based commercial bank or trust company selected by Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in an account for the benefit of the holders of the Shares (other than the Excluded Shares) and the Options, SARs, Performance Awards, Restricted Shares, Stock Purchase Plan Awards or Other 

    ##### 

  

    

Company Awards (collectively, the " _Stock Awards_ "), amounts sufficient in
the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments of the Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent; _provided_ that any and all such investments shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Standard and
Poors or Moodys Investors Service, respectively or a combination of the
foregoing or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1,000,000,000 and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have
a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent (x) to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration, and (y) to mail to each holder of a Stock Award, a check in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.3. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article IV. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for 365 calendar days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in a reasonable amount the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) _No Dissenters  Rights_. Pursuant to Section 1571 of the PBCL, no dissenters rights or rights of appraisal will apply in connection with the Merger. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

    ##### 

  

     

 4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_. 

   

 (a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (an " _Option_ "), under the Company Amended and Restated Employees Stock Incentive and Performance Based Compensation Plan (the " _Amended and Restated Plan_ "), as well as the Companys prior Stock Option Plan which was amended and restated by the Amended and Restated Plan, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Option to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Option times (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Option. 

   

 (b) _Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Stock Appreciation Right to receive a payment based on the increase in the value of a Share (a " _SAR_ ") granted pursuant to the Stock Plans, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such SAR to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the SAR times (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the reference price per Share under such SAR. 

   

 (c) _Performance Awards_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance share (a " _Performance Award_ ") under the Stock Plans, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Performance Award to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Performance Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, times (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (d) _Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall waive any vesting or holding conditions or restrictions applicable to any Shares of restricted stock (" _Restricted Shares_ ") granted pursuant to the Stock Plans, and such Restricted Shares shall be treated the same as all other Shares in accordance with Section 4.1 of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) _Shares Issued Under Stock Plans_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall waive any vesting or holding conditions or restrictions applicable to any Shares that have been issued to any Person by reason of such Persons participation in the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company Directors Stock Purchase Plan, the Company Nonqualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Company Stock Purchase Plan for Preferred Agents (such Plans, together with the Amended and Restated Plan, are referred to herein collectively as the " _Stock Plans_ ", and the Shares which have been so issued are referred to herein collectively as the " _Stock Purchase Plan Awards_ "), and such Shares shall be treated the same as all other Shares in accordance with Section 4.1 of this Agreement _provided_ , _however_ , that all loans that are outstanding and payable by any Person on account of or in respect of such Shares shall be immediately due and payable by such Person to the 

    ##### 

  

    

Company and may be paid from the consideration received by such Person under
Section 4.1 of this Agreement. 

   

 (f) _Other Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans, other than Options, SARs, Performance Awards, Stock Purchase Plan Awards and Restricted Shares, if any (the " _Other Company Awards_ "), shall be converted and shall only entitle the holder of such Other Company Award (if any) to receive an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such Other Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Other Company Award provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceed a specified reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds such reference price), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. The time and form of payment in respect of such Other Company Awards, if any, will be in accordance with the applicable Stock Plan or Benefit Plan. 

   

 (g) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections 4.3(a) through 4.3(g). The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that (i) from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares, other capital stock of the Company, or other compensation of any kind (other than amounts required to be paid pursuant to Sections 4.3(a) through 4.3(g)) to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of the Stock Awards and the Stock Plans will thereupon terminate, and (ii) neither the Merger nor any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to result in a "Hostile Change of Control" or similar event under any employment agreement with any employee of the Company. It is acknowledged, however, that the Merger will be deemed to be a "Change of Control" for the purposes of the Stock Awards. 

   

 4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted. 

    ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE V 

   

 _Representations and Warranties_   

  

 5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed on or after January 1, 2007 and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosure set forth in the sections titled "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements" or in any other section to the extent the disclosure is a forward-looking statement or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or otherwise disclosed to Parent in the corresponding sections or subsections of the letter (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") delivered to it by the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such disclosure to the applicable representation and warranty is reasonably apparent and (ii) with respect to any disclosure of an item relating to a representation or warranty in which the phrase "Material Adverse Effect" appears shall not be deemed to be an admission that such item constitutes or may reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that: 

   

 (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (or, with respect to any such entity which is a Pennsylvania corporation, is subsisting) under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys and its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. Section 5.1(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each jurisdiction where the Company and its Subsidiaries are organized. 

   

 As of the date hereof, the Company conducts its insurance operations solely through the Subsidiaries set forth in Section 5.1(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Company Insurance Subsidiaries_ ").

jurisdiction to write each line of business reported as being written in the
Company SAP Statements, and the Company has made all required filings under
applicable insurance holding company statutes, except where the failure to be
so licensed or authorized, or to make any such filings, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
insurance regulator in any state has notified the Company or any
Company Insurance Subsidiary, orally or in writing, that any Company
Insurance Subsidiary is commercially domiciled in any jurisdiction and, to
the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts that would result in any
Company Insurance Subsidiary being commercially domiciled in any state. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term "knowledge of the Company" means the
actual knowledge of the individuals serving as of January 1, 2008 as the
Companys Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer or as
any Executive Vice President of the Company.

 (D) changes in generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") in the United States or Japan, SAP, the rules or policies of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or any statute, rule or regulation unrelated 

   #####

foregoing, after the date of this Agreement; 

   

 (E) any failure by the Company to meet any estimates of revenues or earnings for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing,  _provided_ that the exception in this clause shall not preclude a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;

 (G) any change or announcement of a potential change in the credit rating or A.M. Best rating of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their securities;  _provided_ that the exception in this clause shall not preclude a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed to a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; 

   

 (H) the entry into or announcement of the execution of this Agreement or compliance by the Company with the terms of this Agreement; and 

   

 (I) the disposition of any interim motion relating to the action described in Schedule 5.1(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter; 

   

 _provided_ that, with respect to clauses (A) and (B), such change,
event, circumstance or development does not (i) primarily relate to (or have
the effect of primarily relating to) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
or (ii) disproportionately adversely affect the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries compared to other companies of similar size operating in the
property and casualty insurance industry in similar geographic areas in which
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate.

All vesting thereunder will be accelerated by the consummation of the Merger. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and owned by the Company, or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance, other than a lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance for Taxes not yet due (each, a " _Lien_ "); it being understood that, and the Company represents and warrants that, certain shares of the Company Subsidiaries originally issued as directors qualifying shares are beneficially owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary and no other Person has any rights as a result of such directors qualifying shares. Except as set forth above and except for securities issued pursuant to the Stock Plans since June 30, 2008, as of the date hereof, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.

The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or

the Company on any matter.

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ") binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i) under any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are sufficient to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the Companys management to allow the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company, or persons performing similar functions, to make decisions regarding required disclosure.

sold and issued insurance products in compliance with insurance Laws
applicable to the business of such Company Insurance Subsidiary and in the
respective jurisdictions in which such products have been sold, except for
such non-compliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, the Company has not received since December 31,
2004 any written notice or communication of any material noncompliance with
any such Laws (which non-compliance would not, individually or in the

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes to be credible providing for the acquisition of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total voting power of the equity securities of the Company if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms relating to confidentiality not significantly 

   ##### 

  

 

less restrictive to the other party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that such executed confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making, or amendment, of any Acquisition
Proposal to the Company); and promptly discloses (and, if

not previously provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after having complied with Section
6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose

Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any
action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that such action is necessary in order for such directors to comply
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) in each such
case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith based on the information then available
and after consultation with its financial advisor that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case
referred to in clause (C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal. 

   

 (b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries with any Person other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub or any controlled Affiliate thereof (a " _Third Party_ "), or (ii) any acquisition by any Third Party or proposal or offer by any Third Party, which if consummated would result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 20% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company or those of any of its Subsidiaries, or 20% or more of the consolidated total assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that would result in any person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment (x) would result in a transaction that if consummated, would be more favorable to the shareholders of the Company than the Merger, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement) and the time likely to be required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal, and (y) is 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Proposal,
including the likelihood of termination and the existence of a
financing contingency. 

   

 (c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. 

   

 (i) The Board of Directors of the Company and each committee of the Board of Directors shall not withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger, or fail to reaffirm its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger within three Business Days after receiving a written request to do so from Parent, or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or publicly propose to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ "). 

   

 (ii) The Company shall not, and the Board of Directors shall not cause or permit the Company to, and the Company shall not cause or permit any Company Subsidiary to, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (except for confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 6.2(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "). 

  

 (d) _Change in Company Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company may, prior to but not after the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, make a Change in Company Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Board of Directors may not take any such action in connection with an Acquisition Proposal unless (1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) prior to making such Change in Recommendation, the Company provides prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Change in Recommendation Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and copies of any documents evidencing such Superior Proposal), and any material modifications to any of the foregoing, (3) during the Change in Recommendation Notice Period the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith should Parent propose to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute (in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors) a Superior Proposal and (4) such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute (in the good 

   ##### 

  

 

faith judgment of the Board of Directors) a Superior Proposal after taking
into account any such amendments that Parent shall have agreed to make prior
to the end of the Change in Recommendation Notice Period; _it being
understood_ that any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Change in
Recommendation Notice Period.

Merger Sub) will, at the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company or at
the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a

Effect (a " _Negative Regulatory Action_ ");  _provided_ that any actions of

Best with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby) which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and amount as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the covered persons, in the aggregate, than the coverage currently provided by the Current Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend an aggregate amount to purchase such tail policy that would be in excess of an amount equal to 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company under the Current Policy (the " _Insurance Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the cost of such tail policy would exceed the Insurance Amount, the Company shall be obligated to purchase, and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, a tail policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Insurance Amount.

policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.11 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any
such policies. 

   

 6.12. _Other Actions by the Company_. 

   

 (a) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute (including, without limitation, Subchapter F of Chapter 25 of the PBCL) is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreements, the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement (as long as prior to the Effective Time neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any Affiliate thereof becomes, without the Companys consent, an "interested shareholder" under Section 2553 of the PBCL except as a result of the execution of the Voting Agreements), and otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on such transactions. 

   

 (b) _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Shares) that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company. 

   

 6.13. _Parent Vote_. Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares and any shares of common stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement at any meeting of shareholders of the Company or Merger Sub, respectively, at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and approval and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of shareholders of either the Company or Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting). 

   

 6.14. _Formation of Merger Sub; Accession_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and in any event within twenty (20) calendar days after the date hereof, Parent shall form a Pennsylvania corporation as an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). Promptly after incorporating Merger Sub, and in any event within twenty five (25) calendar days after the date hereof, (x) Parent shall cause the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, in its capacity as such, to approve and adopt this Agreement and (y) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accede to this Agreement by executing a signature page to this Agreement, after which time Merger Sub shall be a 

     ##### 

  

    

party hereto for all purposes set forth herein. Notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, (i) the obligations of Merger Sub to perform its
covenants hereunder shall commence only at the time of its incorporation and
(ii) the representations and warranties of Merger Sub set forth in Section
5.2 shall be deemed to have been made as though Merger Sub had been a party
to this Agreement as of the date hereof. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to cause the Board of
Directors of Merger Sub to unanimously approve this Agreement and declare it
advisable for Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and its Affiliates may
amend, or cause to be amended, the by-laws of Merger Sub at any time prior to
the Effective Time so long as such amendment would not impair, delay or
prevent the Closing. 

   

 6.15. _Ownership of Director s Qualifying Shares_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause (i) the 10 shares of common stock of Philadelphia Insurance Company (" _PIC_ ") owned of record by natural persons who were directors of PIC at or after the time of its formation and are currently officers or directors of the Company or a Company Subsidiary and (ii) the 12 shares of common stock of Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company (" _PIIC_ ") owned of record by natural persons who were directors of PIIC at or after the time of its formation and are currently officers or directors of the Company or a Company Subsidiary to be owned beneficially and of record by the Company. 

   

 6.16. _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists Company Subsidiaries that are no longer doing business (each, a " _Dormant Subsidiary_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, if Parent provides a written request, the Company will cause each of the Dormant Subsidiaries identified in Parents request to be merged with and into a Company Subsidiary other than a Company Insurance Subsidiary, or liquidated or dissolved (as specified in Parents request), _provided_ that in no event shall the Company be required to effect any such merger, liquidation or dissolution if (a) such action would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the Merger or (b) Parent fails to deliver its written request therefor sufficiently in advance of the Effective Time such that it is reasonably practicable for such merger, liquidation or dissolution to be effective prior to the Effective Time, taking into account any filing and/or approval requirements under applicable Law, reasonable preparation and documentation time and such other factors as the Company reasonably determines are relevant.

 (d) The parties each agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due under this Section 8.5 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for such amounts, the Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of 

    ##### 

  

    

actual payment at the rate of interest published from time to time in The Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any successor publication thereto),
designated therein as the prime rate on the date such payment was due,
together with the costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the
event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company
pursuant to this Section 8.5, the Termination Fee shall be Parents and
Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this
Agreement.

 9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 7, 2008, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

   

 9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the directors and officers referred to in Section 6.11 with respect to the covenants in their favor referred to therein, the Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including, without limitation, the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until the 

  ##### 

  

    

Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have
the right to recover, solely through an action brought by the Company,
damages from Parent in the event of a willful or intentional breach of this
Agreement by Parent, in which event the damages recoverable by the Company for
itself and on behalf of the Companys shareholders and the holders of the
Stock Awards shall be determined by reference to the total amount that would
have been recoverable by such shareholders and holders if all such
shareholders and holders brought an action against Parent and were recognized
as third party beneficiaries hereunder. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. 

   

 9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement requires the Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

   

 9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the Person that has the primary legal liability for such Taxes. 

   

 9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 

   

 9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction. 

    ##### 

  

     

 9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. 

   

 (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

   

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section of such Disclosure Letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. 

   

 9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary which is a Pennsylvania corporation to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise impede the rights of the shareholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. 

   

 9.15. _Dates and Dollar Amounts_. All references to dates in this Agreement shall be deemed to be references to dates in the United States, and all references to "$" or "dollars" shall be references to United States dollars.
