AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of
August 30, 2020, among Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
" _Company_ "); Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "); and Avalanche Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "). Certain capitalized
terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

RECITALS 

The Company is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing antisense
medicines to treat patients with serious and rare diseases.

As of the date of this Agreement, Parent beneficially owns 77,094,682 shares
of the Company Common Stock, representing approximately 76% of the total
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

The Company has established the Special Committee and delegated to it
authority to review, evaluate, negotiate, recommend or not recommend a
proposal by Parent with respect to a business combination transaction with
Parent.

 

The Special Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement.

 

The Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee,
has approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.

The boards of directors of Parent and Purchaser have each approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively,
to enter into this Agreement.

Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that, subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section
251(h) of the DGCL and shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, be consummated as soon as practicable following
the consummation of the Offer.

The Parties agree as follows:

   

SECTION 1

 

 _THE OFFER_

 

1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8_, on the tenth (10th)
business day after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having
timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to
_Sections_ __ _ 1.1(e)_ and _1.2(b)_ ), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Shares_ ") (other than any
Shares held immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time by (i) the
Company (or held in the Companys treasury) or (ii) Parent, Purchaser or any
other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent) for $18.15 per
Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (such amount, the "
_Offer Price_ "), and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_.

 

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the satisfaction of the
Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the other conditions set
forth in _Annex_ __ _ I_ (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Condition, the Termination Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser
expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any
Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions
of the Offer, so long as such changes are consistent with the terms of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (1) Parent and Purchaser shall not amend, modify
or waive the Minimum Condition and (2) without the prior written consent of
the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the
maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose
conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions,
(E) amend, modify or waive the Termination Condition or the condition set
forth in _clause_ __ _ (f)_ of _Annex_ __ _ I_, (F) otherwise amend or
modify any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects,
or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any holder of Shares
(other than Parent and its Affiliates) in its capacity as such, (G) terminate
the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date, in
each case, except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(c)_ or _1.1(d)_ or (H)
provide any "subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) within the
meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not
be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date)
of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 8_.

 

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange 

 



2

    

 Act) from the Offer Commencement Date (unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by Parent and the Company) (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date
or such subsequent date to which the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is
extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration
Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective termination rights under
_Section_ __ _ 8_: (i) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any
Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by Purchaser or
Parent, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, Parent and Purchaser
may, in their sole discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any
other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional
period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer
Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for any period required by
any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff
thereof or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer; and (iii) if, as of the then-
scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an
additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the
earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance
with _Section_ __ _ 8_ and (y) the End Date (such earlier occurrence, the "
_Extension Deadline_ "), (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the
Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company or (3) be
required to extend the Offer on more than two (2) occasions in consecutive
periods of ten (10) business days each if, as of the applicable Expiration
Date, (A) none of the Offer Documents, the Parent Schedule 13E-3, the
Schedule 14D-9 or the Company Schedule 13E-3 is still being reviewed or
commented on by the SEC and (B) all of the Offer Conditions are satisfied or
have been waived other than the Minimum Condition and conditions which by
their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer. Purchaser
shall not terminate the Offer, or permit the Offer to expire, prior to the
Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company.

(d) Termination of Offer. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ shall be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the
Company, Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately,
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any
Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
immediately return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of
Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(e) Offer Documents and Parent Schedule 13E-3. As promptly as practicable
on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the
SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ ") and a Rule 13E-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3
(together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule_ __ _ 13E-3_" and such Schedule 13E-3 filed by Parent and
Purchaser, the " _Parent Schedule_ __ _ 13E-3_") that will contain or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter
of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and the Parent Schedule

 



3

    

 13E-3 and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and
to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and
Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents and the Parent
Schedule 13E-3 filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC (x) to comply
in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal
Requirements and (y) to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided, however_ , that no covenant
is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Offer Documents or the Parent Schedule 13E-3. Each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents or the Parent Schedule 13E-3 if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents and the Parent Schedule 13E-3 as
so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements. The Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation and the Special Committee Recommendation in the Offer Documents
and the Parent Schedule 13E-3. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise
make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all
information concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may be
required in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
1.1(e)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Offer Documents and the Parent Schedule 13E-3
(including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC
or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent and Purchaser
agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments (including oral
comments) Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Parent Schedule 13E-3
promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments).

 

(f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, Parent
shall cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the funds
necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely
basis, all of its obligations under this Agreement.

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

(h) Acceptance. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent
waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the
Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) (i)
promptly after the Expiration Date accept for payment all Shares tendered
(and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of such
acceptance, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) promptly after the Offer
Acceptance Time pay for such Shares.

 



4

    

(i) Transfer Taxes. If the payment of any of the Offer Price is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the tendered Shares are
registered on the stockholder list described in _Section_ __ _ 1.2(b)_ as of
the Stockholder List Date, it shall be a condition of payment that the Shares
so tendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Offer Price to a Person other than the registered holder of the Shares
tendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
transfer or other Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None of
Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for
the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(i)_
under any circumstance.

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9 and Company Schedule 13E-3. As promptly as practicable
on the Offer Commencement Date, following the filing of the Offer Documents,
the Company shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule_ __ _ 14D-9_")
and a Schedule 13E-3 (such Schedule 13E-3 filed by the Company, the " _Company
Schedule_ __ _ 13E-3_") that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, shall
reflect the Company Board Recommendation and the Special Committee
Recommendation and include the notice and other information required by
Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 and the
Company Schedule 13E-3 and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements,
including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record date for purposes
of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company
agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 and the Company Schedule 13E-3
(x) to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided, however_
, that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied
by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Company Schedule 13E-3. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments
(including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Company
Schedule 13E-3 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and
Purchaser shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company or
the Companys legal counsel all information concerning Parent or Purchaser
that may be required in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_. Except to the extent an amendment relates to an
Acquisition Proposal, a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated in Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, Parent and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and the
Company Schedule 13E-3 (including any response to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, except to the extent
such comments relate to the portion of an amendment related to an Acquisition

 



5

    

 Proposal, a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated in Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such
comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company agrees to provide Parent
and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) the Company or
its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 or the Company Schedule 13E-3 promptly after receipt of those comments
(including oral comments).

 

(b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a
list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or
computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories,
in each case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date,
and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated
lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and
such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with
the Offer and the Merger (the date of the list used to determine the Persons
to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated,
which date shall not be more than ten (10) business days prior to the date
the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the "
_Stockholder List Date_ "). Except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents, the Parent Schedule 13E-3 and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Purchaser and
their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any
such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request by the Company, deliver, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or
destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then
in their possession or control, and, if requested by the Company, promptly
certify to the Company in writing that all such material has been returned or
destroyed.

(c) Share Registry. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by
Purchaser effective immediately after the Offer Acceptance Time.

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company
(or held in the Companys treasury) shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent,
Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(iii) except as provided in _clauses_ __ _ (i)_ and _(ii)_ above and
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_, each Share outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares, which shall have only
those rights set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_), shall be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price, without any interest thereon (such amount,
the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and subject to any withholding of Taxes in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_; and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of
Purchaser then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except (1) the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, or (2) any rights set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ in respect of Dissenting Shares.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Offer
Price to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(b)_ and to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.
Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make the payment of
the aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(h)_. On or
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ (together with the
amount deposited pursuant the immediately preceding sentence, the " _Payment
Fund_ ").

 



8

    

 The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the
aggregate Offer Price in the Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in
the Merger. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that such investments shall
be (w) in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, (x) in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (y) in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or (z) in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination
of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three (3) months; _provided, further,_ that no gain or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that the Payment Fund includes at all times cash
sufficient to satisfy Parents and Purchasers obligations under this
Agreement.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
(i) Shares represented by a certificate evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who, in each case was entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, (A) a
form of letter of transmittal, which shall be in reasonable and customary form
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.6(f)_, if applicable) to the Paying Agent, or a customary agents message
in respect to Book-Entry Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(f)_,
if applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal
in the case of Certificates, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to the instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be
cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such transfer or other Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and
the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other
similar Taxes described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_ under any
circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as

 



9

    

 contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, each Certificate and Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (with respect to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_) which had been
made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal
Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the
property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 

(e) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser,
and their Affiliates, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the
Paying Agent or the Depository Agent to deduct and withhold) from the Offer
Price, the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the Shares or any
holder of Company Options or Company RSUs or any other consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required by
any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such
payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any
such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, holder of Company
Options or Company RSUs or other recipient of consideration hereunder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by that

 



10

    

 Certificate, or by a representative of that holder, claiming that
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not exceed the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Paying
Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2_.

 

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for
appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be automatically
cancelled and no longer outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be
entitled to only such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall have failed
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_), and such Shares shall not be deemed to
be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and
Purchaser of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the
Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to direct and
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands,
and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and
Purchaser, settle or offer to settle, or make any payment with respect to, any
such demands, or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

2.8 Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding and
unexercised, whether or not vested and which has a per share exercise price
that is less than the Merger Consideration (each, an " _In the Money Option_
"), shall be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to
receive a cash payment equal to (A) the excess of (x) the Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price payable per Share under such In the
Money Option, _multiplied by_ (B) the total number of Shares subject to such
In the Money Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (without regard
to vesting).

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option, other than an In the
Money Option, that is then outstanding and unexercised, whether or not
vested, shall be cancelled with no consideration payable to the holder thereof
in respect thereof.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company RSU, whether or
not vested, shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive a cash payment

 



11

    

 equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of
Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no
later than the later of (i) five (5) business days after the Effective Time
and (ii) the first payroll date after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, pay the
aggregate consideration payable pursuant to  _Sections_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ and
_2.8(c)_ , net of any applicable withholding Taxes, with respect to In the
Money Options and Company RSUs through, to the extent applicable, the
Surviving Corporations payroll to the holders of Company Options and/or
Company RSUs.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions appropriate or necessary to effect the transactions described in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_, including, if deemed appropriate or necessary by the
Company, the acceleration of the exercisability of the Company Options.

 

(f) To the extent a payment made pursuant to the timing otherwise set forth
in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ would trigger a Tax or penalty under Section
409A of the Code, such payment shall be made on the earliest subsequent date
that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

 

2.9 FIRPTA Certificate. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a certificate and form of notice to the IRS prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) (the " _FIRPTA
Certificate_ ") along with written authorization for Parent to deliver the
FIRPTA Certificate to the IRS on behalf of the Company upon the Closing of the
Merger. The Companys obligation to deliver the FIRPTA Certificate shall not
be considered a condition precedent to the Offer or the Closing of
the Merger.

2.10 Further Action. The Parties agree to take all necessary action to
cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2_ as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer without a
meeting of the Companys stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the
DGCL. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take such action.

in the section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule corresponding
to the particular Section or subsection in this  _Section_ __ _ 3_; (ii) any
exception or disclosure set forth in any other section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure

 



12

    

 Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent that such exception or

Documents or other general cautionary or forward-looking statements in any
other sections of such Company SEC Documents), (b) the representations and
warranties contained in this _Section_ __ _ 3_ are not made in respect of any
Contract solely between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, and (c) all
matters actually known as of the date hereof by Parents chief executive
officer, chief financial officer and general counsel shall be deemed
disclosed in respect of this Agreement).

3.1 Due Organization; Subsidiaries, Etc.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the Companys only
Subsidiaries are set forth in Exhibit 21.1 to the Companys Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the Company and
each such Subsidiary, an " _Acquired Corporation_ " and collectively, the "
_Acquired Corporations_ "). Each such Subsidiary is an Entity duly organized,
validly existing and, except as has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, formation or organization, as applicable. Each Acquired
Corporation has all necessary power and authority: (i) to conduct its
business in the manner in which its business is currently being conducted; and
(ii) to own and use its assets in the manner in which its assets are currently
owned and used, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each Acquired Corporation is qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business requires such qualification
or licensing, except where the failure does not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or equity interests of the other Acquired
Corporations, free and clear of all Encumbrances and transfer restrictions,
except for Permitted Encumbrances or Encumbrances or transfer restrictions of
general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act
or applicable securities laws. Except for the shares of capital stock or
equity interests of the other Acquired Corporations held by the Company, no
Acquired Corporation owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or equity
interests of, or subscriptions, options, calls, warrants or rights (whether
or not currently exercisable) to acquire, or other securities convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or equity interests of
any Entity.

 

3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has delivered or
made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, including all amendments thereto, as in effect on
the date hereof, through filings with the SEC.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: (i)
125,000,000 Shares, of which 101,615,491 Shares had been issued and were

27, 2020 in accordance with the terms of such Company Options or Company RSUs.
All of the outstanding Shares and the outstanding shares of capital stock or
equity interests of the other Acquired Corporations have been duly authorized
and validly issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable.

Corporation is under any obligation to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any outstanding shares of capital stock or equity interests of the Acquired
Corporations. The Shares constitute the only outstanding class of securities
of any Acquired Corporation registered under the Securities Act.

were subject to issuance pursuant to Company Options granted and outstanding

(and Shares issuable upon the exercise thereof), there are no: (i) outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of any Acquired Corporation; (ii)

Corporation is obligated to sell or otherwise issue any shares of its capital
stock or any other securities.

(e) The Company has delivered or made available a true and correct listing
of all Persons who hold outstanding Company Options or Company RSUs as of the
close of business on August 24, 2020, indicating, with respect to each Company
Option or Company RSU, the number of Shares subject thereto and, with respect

3.4 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

 

(a) Since July 19, 2017 (the " _IPO Date_ "), the Company has filed or
furnished on a timely basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated
therein) required to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (as
supplemented, modified or amended since the time of filing, the " _Company
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended prior to the
date of this Agreement, as of the date of (and giving effect to) the last such
amendment (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements,
on the date of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
to those Company SEC Documents, and, except to the extent that information
contained in such Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or
superseded (prior to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC
Document, none of the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes and schedules)
contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC
on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act); and (iii)
fairly presented, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows of the Company for the periods covered thereby (subject, in the
case of the unaudited financial statements, to the absence of notes and to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

(c) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) which is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of 

 



15

    

 financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the Board of Directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of the Company that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. The Companys management has completed an assessment

and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the principal executive

material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the
Company SEC Documents.

thereto, when filed, distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company Disclosure
Documents, at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Documents or
any supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and at the time such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments thereto are first
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

employer with the Company under the Code or ERISA (other than Parent) has ever
maintained, contributed to, or been required to contribute to, or otherwise
incurred any material liability with respect to, (i) a plan subject to Title
IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Code Section 412 or 4971, including any "single

material Legal Proceeding against an Employee Plan, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to such Employee Plan or the assets of any related trusts; (iii)

the DOL, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any other

be made to any Employee Plan, by applicable Legal Requirements or otherwise,
and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding
any Employee Plan, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date of this Agreement, have been
fully reflected on the financial statements of the Company in accordance with
GAAP (to the extent required by GAAP).

(e) Except to the extent required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA or
4980B of the Code (or any other similar state or local Legal Requirement) or

employee, officer, director or other service provider of the Company or its

welfare plan.

 

(f) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, the consummation of the
Transactions (including in combination with other events or circumstances
that on their own would not result in any entitlement to payment) will not (i)
entitle any current or former employee, director, officer, independent
contractor or other service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or any other material payment or benefit, (ii) accelerate the

of, compensation or benefits due to any such employee, director, officer,

38

    

(c) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time any Acquired Corporation or any of their Representatives
receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any
Person or group of Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed on
or after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, (i) the Company and its Representatives may
contact such Person or group of Persons solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof and (ii) if the Board of Directors or the Special
Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer, then the Company and its
Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to
the Acquired Corporations to the Person or group of Persons who has made such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and no later than within 24 hours) provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Acquired Corporations that is provided to

the Company that is required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(f) The Company agrees that if any Acquired Corporation or any officer,
director or employee of an Acquired Corporation takes any action which, if
taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_,
the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_. The
Company further agrees that if any Representative of an Acquired Corporation
(other than an officer, director or employee of an Acquired Corporation) takes
any action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute an intentional
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3,_ and results in a _bona fide_ publicly
disclosed Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

 



39

    

5.4 Notice of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other of:

(a) any notice or other communication received by such Party from
any Governmental Body in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the other Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the
other Transactions;

 

(b) any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened
in writing against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise

the Merger or the other Transactions;

 

(c) the occurrence of any event, occurrence, circumstance, change or effect
relating to it which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to the Company, or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, with respect to Parent, as the case may be;

 

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of such Party
contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would
reasonably be expected to cause any Offer Condition not to be satisfied; or

(e) any failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder;

 

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 5.4_ shall not affect the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or obligations of the Parties hereunder or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties hereunder.

 

SECTION 6

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES_

 

6.1 Company Board Recommendation and Special Committee Recommendation.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation and the
Special Committee Recommendation in the Offer Documents. During the Pre-
Closing Period, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, neither the Board
of Directors nor any committee thereof (including the Special Committee)
shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation or the Special Committee
Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly
propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Change Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow the Company to execute or enter into any Contract with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or
fail to consummate, or that would

 



40

    

 otherwise materially impede, or interfere with, the Transactions (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

(i) if any Acquired Corporation has received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors or the Special
Committee shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Offer, (x) the Board of Directors or the Special Committee may
make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) provided that no Acquired
Corporation is in material breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to
such Superior Offer, in each case, if and only if: (A) the Board of Directors
or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors or the Special Committee,
respectively, to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of
its intention to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ at least five (5) days
prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination
(a " _Determination Notice_ ") (which notice shall not constitute a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation or termination) and, if desired by Parent,
during such five (5)-day period shall have negotiated in good faith with
respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to
the extent proposed by Parent so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease
to constitute a Superior Offer; and (C) (1) the Company shall have provided to
Parent information with respect to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the
five (5)-day period after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer, and (3) after giving
effect to the proposals made by Parent during such period, if any, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors or the Special
Committee shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the Company Adverse
Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(e)_ would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors or the Special Committee, respectively, to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look
and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not be considered a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a
Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(i)_ shall
also apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a
new Determination Notice, except that the references to five (5) days shall
be deemed to be three (3) days; and

(ii) in connection with an Intervening Event, the Board of Directors or
the Special Committee may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation if: (A)
the Board of Directors or the Special Committee determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the

 



41

    

 Board of Directors or the Special Committee, respectively, to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have
given Parent a Determination Notice at least five (5) days prior to making
any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation and, if desired by Parent,
during such five (5)-day period shall have negotiated in good faith with
respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal
to the extent proposed by Parent so that a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation would no longer be necessary; and (C) (1) the Company shall
have specified in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances underlying
the Intervening Event that render a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
necessary, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the five (5)-day period
after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or make another proposal so that a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (3) after giving effect to
the proposals made by Parent during such period, if any, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors or the Special Committee
shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company
Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors or the
Special Committee, respectively, to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
6.1(b)(ii)_ shall also apply to any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event and require a new
Determination Notice, except that for purposes of such subsequent
Determination Notice, the references to five (5) days shall be deemed to be
three (3) days.

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

(a) The Parties agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Legal Requirements (including any Antitrust Laws if
applicable) that may be asserted by any Governmental Body or any other party,
so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, but in no
case later than the End Date, including providing as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable all information required by any Governmental Body.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable) to
cooperate with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and
making, any other filings, notifications or other consents are required to be
made with, or obtained from, any Governmental Bodies in connection with the
Transactions.

6.3 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) During the one (1) year period following the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or another Affiliate of
Parent (including the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries) to, provide to
each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who is employed
at the Closing and who remains employed with the Surviving Corporation or any
Affiliate of Parent (including the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries) ("
_Company Employees_ "), for so long during such period as the Company Employee
remains so employed, (i) a salary and annual bonus opportunity not less than
that in effect immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than either

 



42

    

 (1) the benefits provided to such employee under the Employee Plans
immediately prior to the Closing or (2) the benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent, and (iii) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those provided to such employee immediately prior to the
Closing as disclosed on Section 6.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or another
Affiliate of Parent (including the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries), as
applicable, to give Company Employees full credit for such Company Employees
service with the Company for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and
determination of the level of benefits, and for purposes of benefit accruals,
under any benefit plans made generally available to employees of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates in which a Company
Employee participates to the same extent recognized by the Company or
its applicable Affiliate immediately prior to the Closing; _provided,
however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service or for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined
benefit plan.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate
of Parent (including the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries), as applicable,
to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to
Company Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or
any Affiliate of Parent (including the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries)
that provides health benefits in which Company Employees participate following
the Closing, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to
such employees as of the Closing under the analogous Employee Plan, (ii) honor
any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they
participated immediately prior to the Closing during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates in which they are eligible
to participate after the Closing in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her
eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each case to the extent such
Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous benefit plan prior to the
Closing.

(d) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less
than ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors
(or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to terminate the Companys
401(k) Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and to vest all participant
accounts thereunder, effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date,
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. If the Company 401(k) Plan is
terminated, as provided herein, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to, have
in effect a tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan as of the
Effective Time, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, that
includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") in which each
Company Employee who was an active participant in the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan shall be
eligible to

 



43

    

 participate as of the Closing, and as soon as practicable following the
Closing the account balances of the Company 401(k) Plans participants shall
be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted
by the Parent 401(k) Plan and the Code, permit such Company Employees to make
rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code
(including promissory notes evidencing outstanding participant loans), in the
form of cash (and in-kind in the case of participant loan notes), in an amount
equal to the full account balance distributed to such Company Employee from
the Company 401(k) Plan. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to take any
and all commercially reasonable actions needed to permit each Company Employee
with an outstanding loan balance under the Company 401(k) Plan as of the
Closing Date to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Company 401(k)
Plan after the Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the
notes evidencing such loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k)
Plan so as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a deemed
distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans.

 

(e) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall provide Parent
with reasonable advance copies of any notices or communication materials
(including website postings) from any Acquired Corporation to its employees
with respect to the Transactions or employment, compensation or benefits
matters of such employees that relate to the period following the Closing
Date, and shall not distribute or disseminate such materials without Parents
prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided,_ that no such approval shall be required for
statements consistent with both (1) a previous press release, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually,
if such previous press release, disclosure or statement had been approved by
the other Party) and (2) any previous non-public communication to employees
previously made and approved by the Parties.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ are solely for the benefit
of the Parties, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ is intended to,
or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any
employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement or have
the right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in
any Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation or to any compensation or benefits and
the employment of each Company Employee shall be "at will" employment.

6.4 ESPP. The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the
terms of the Company ESPP or otherwise to provide that (i) no new offering
period will be commenced following the date of this Agreement under the
Company ESPP, (ii) there will be no increase in the amount of participants
payroll deduction elections under the Company ESPP during the current offering
period from those in effect as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) no
individuals shall commence participation in the Company ESPP during
the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, (iv)
each purchase right issued pursuant to the Company ESPP shall be fully
exercised not later than five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time
and (v) the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately following the exercise
of the purchase rights

 



44

    

 contemplated by the immediately preceding clause (iv) and no further rights
shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP thereafter.

 

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees
that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time)
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of any
Acquired Corporation, including in the Companys certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, and any indemnification or other similar agreements of any
Acquired Corporation, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms, and Parent shall cause the Acquired Corporations to perform their
obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will, indemnify
and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of any Acquired
Corporation or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of any Acquired
Corporation as a director or officer of another Person (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including this Agreement and the transactions
and actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of any Acquired
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of any Acquired Corporation
as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements. If any such claim, action, suit or proceeding
arises, (x) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding
from the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
the extent provided for in, and in accordance with, the organizational
documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement;  _provided_ that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the
DGCL or the Surviving Corporations or its Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any such
indemnification or other similar agreements, as applicable, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any
such matter.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit
of the Acquired Corporations or provide substitute policies for the Acquired
Corporations and their current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors and officers liability insurance coverage

 



45

    

 currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations, in
either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the
Acquired Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred at or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at
least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance), except that in no event shall Parent be required to pay
annual premiums with respect to such insurance policies in an amount more
than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by Parent with
respect to the shared primary policy that covers both Parent and the Acquired
Corporations or in an amount more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium
most recently paid by or allocable to the Acquired Corporations with respect
to coverage applicable only to the Acquired Corporations, in each case prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ _"_ ), except to the
extent Parent elects to pay a higher increase for the portion of the shared
primary policy allocable to Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Acquired Corporations); and if the Parent or Surviving Corporation is unable
to obtain the insurance required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six
(6)-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount (as may be increased
to the extent Parent elects to pay a higher increase for the portion of the
shared primary policy allocable to Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Acquired Corporations)). In lieu of such continuation of insurance coverage
applicable only to the Acquired Corporations, prior to the Closing Date the
Company may at its option (and if the Company does not do so on or prior to
the Closing Date, Parent may at its option from and after the Closing Date),
purchase "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy(ies) (in
respect of one or more of such current policies) for the Acquired Corporations
and their current and former directors and officers who are currently covered
by the directors and officers liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations and to have
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the
benefit of the Acquired Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no
event shall the cost of any such tail policy(ies) exceed the Maximum Amount
(pro rated in respect of the policies that will be the subject of such tail
coverage). In lieu of such continuation of insurance coverage applicable to
both Parent and the Acquired Corporations, Parent may at its option from and
after the Closing Date), purchase "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance policy(ies) (in respect of one or more of such current policies) for
the Acquired Corporations and their current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired

claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective

assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or the Acquired

enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified
Persons), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable
Legal Requirement, this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ may not be amended, altered or

shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to

notify Parent of any such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed with respect to the status thereof.

Transactions, (b) seek each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant
to any Material Contract by such Party in connection with the Transactions to
the extent requested in writing by Parent and (c) seek to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger brought by any third
Person against such Party.

other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(d_ _)_ ; or

 

(iii) (1) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to

only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this
Agreement pursuant to the proviso to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_), by Parent
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(i)_, (2) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior to such termination
and such Acquisition Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn prior to such
termination and (3) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company

, _(ii)_ , or _(iii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, the Company shall pay
to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day
funds (x) in the case of  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(i)_, prior to or
simultaneously with (and as a condition to the effectiveness of)

 



52

    

such termination, (y) in the case of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(ii)_, within
three (3) business days after such termination or (z) in the case of
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iii)_, within three (3) business days after the earlier
of the entry into a definitive agreement for or the consummation of
the Acquisition Proposal referred to in _clause (3)_ of _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)(iii)_ or; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used
herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $15,000,000.
Payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and upon the payment of the Termination Fee, none of
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any

the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated as described in _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_, (i) payment from the Company to Parent of the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates against the Acquired
Corporations and any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates
(collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and (ii) upon payment of
such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions.

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain
the payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding against the Company, then (i)
the non-prevailing Party in such Legal Proceeding shall pay the prevailing
Party reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) arising out of such Legal Proceeding and (ii),
exclusively in the event that Parent prevails in such Legal Proceeding, the
Company shall pay interest on the amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_ as determined in such Legal Proceeding. Any interest payment
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_ shall be calculated based on the
prime rate as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date the
applicable payment due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, if any, was
required to be made.

 

SECTION 9

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

 

9.1 Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended
at any time with the approval of the Board of Directors (subject to the prior
approval of the Special Committee) and the boards of directors of Parent and
Purchaser, in each case as constituted at the Offer Acceptance Time. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties.

 



53

    

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party and any such waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to any, subsequent or
other failure. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand (subject to the prior
approval of the Special Committee), may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by
the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if is expressly set forth in a
written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Party or
Parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist
on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

 

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Offer
Acceptance Time.

 

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement (including its Exhibits,
Annexes and the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties
and their respective Affiliates, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
including by facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties.

 

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions: (i) each of
the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if (but only if) such
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware and any appellate court
therefrom (collectively,

 



54

    

 the " _Delaware Courts_ "); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably
consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive
notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.9_. Each of the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally (1) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in the Delaware Courts, (2) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the
Delaware Courts, (3) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the
Delaware Courts and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in the Delaware Courts. The Parties agree that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however_ , that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if the
Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of
the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such order or injunction.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY
PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF. EACH PARTY (I) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 9.5_.

9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their
