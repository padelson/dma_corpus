$12.00 per share of Public Company Common Stock; in each case, on the terms
and subject to the conditions contained herein (collectively, along with all

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Public Company (together with any duly
authorized committee thereof, the "Public Company Board") has unanimously (i)

 ![](srtex2131518aegistransac011.jpg) 

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 2 Agreement, in the form agreed to by the Stockholder
(each, a "Support Agreement" and collectively the "Support Agreements"),
pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other things, agreed to vote
all of their shares of capital stock in favor of the Transactions and against
any competing proposals; and WHEREAS, concurrently with the Closing, and as a
condition and inducement to the parties' willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Public Company and the Stockholder shall enter into a Stockholders
Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Stockholders Agreement"). NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for other valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
Public Company, Private Company and the Stockholder agree as follows:
ARTICLE I TRANSACTIONS 1.1 Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Public Company shall
purchase from Stockholder, and Stockholder shall sell, convey, assign,
transfer and deliver to Public Company, all of the outstanding shares of
Private Company Common Stock, free and clear of all Liens (the "Sale").
"Lien" means any mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, charge or other
security interest or ownership interest or claim of any kind in respect of
any asset or Person. 1.2 Issuance. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and in consideration
of the Sale, Public Company shall issue and deliver to Stockholder or its
designee, twenty million six hundred thousand (20,600,000) shares of Public
Company Common Stock, free and clear of all Liens (as may be adjusted pursuant
to Section 1.6 and further adjusted for stock splits, consolidation and other
similar corporate events, the "Base Number of Shares") (the "Issuance"). 1.3
Additional Cash Payment and Additional Shares. In addition to the Sale and
Issuance, at the Closing, the Stockholder shall purchase from Public Company
for the Additional Cash Payment, and the Public Company shall issue and
deliver to the Stockholder or its designee, eight hundred and thirty-three
thousand, three hundred and thirty-three (833,333) shares of Public Company
Common Stock (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and further
adjusted for stock splits, consolidation and other similar corporate events,
the "Additional Shares"). 1.4 The Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set
forth in Article VII, the closing of the Transactions (the "Closing") will
take place on a date to be specified by Public Company and Private Company,
which shall not be later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the day
on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) to be  

  

 ![](srtex2131518aegistransac012.jpg) 

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 3 satisfied or waived has been satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement, at the offices of Jenner and Block LLP, 353 N.
Clark St., Chicago, Illinois 60654, unless another date, place or time is
agreed to in writing by Public Company and Private Company. For the avoidance
of doubt, in the event the number of shares to be issued to the Stockholder
or its designee in respect of a Positive Debt Amount would exceed the Base
Number Increase Cap, the Closing Date shall occur two (2) Business Days after
the expected Closing Date pursuant to Section 1.6(a) to accommodate the time
period to seek consent or waiver as set forth in Section 1.6(c). For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Business Day" shall mean any day other
than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banking institutions
in New York, New York or Singapore are authorized or permitted by applicable
Law to be closed, and the term "Closing Date" shall mean the date on which
the Closing actually occurs. 1.5 Actions at the Closing. At the Closing: (a)
Private Company and the Stockholder shall deliver to Public Company the
various certificates, instruments and documents referred to in Section 7.3;
(b) Public Company shall deliver to the Stockholder the various certificates,
instruments and documents referred to in Section 7.2; (c) Public Company
shall deliver to the Stockholder certificates representing the number of
shares of Public Company Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 1.2 and
Section 1.3; (d) the Stockholder shall deliver to Public Company by wire
transfer of immediately available funds an amount in cash equal to the
Additional Cash Payment pursuant to Section 1.3; and (e) the Stockholder
shall deliver or procure to be delivered to Public Company stock certificates
representing all of the shares of Private Company Common Stock owned by the
Stockholder, duly endorsed in blank for transfer or accompanied by duly
executed stock powers assigning all of the outstanding shares of Private
Company Common Stock in blank, and any other documents necessary to transfer
to Public Company good and valid title to such shares free and clear of all
Liens. 1.6 Net Debt Adjustment. (a) On the third (3rd) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date, (i) Public Company shall deliver to the Stockholder a
statement prepared in good faith setting forth the Public Company Net Debt as
determined as of 11:59 PM (Eastern Time) on the Business Day immediately
prior to such date, including a separate line item for each component set
forth in such definition and reasonable supporting documentation used in the
preparation of such statement; and (ii) Private Company shall deliver to the
Stockholder a statement prepared in good faith setting forth the Private
Company Net Debt as determined as of 11:59 PM (Eastern Time) on the Business
Day immediately prior to such date, including a separate line item for each
component set forth in such definition and reasonable supporting documentation
used in the preparation of such statement. Each of the Public Company, on the
one hand, and the Private Company or the Stockholder, on the other hand,
shall have the right to review and comment on  

  

 ![](srtex2131518aegistransac013.jpg) 

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 4 the Private Company Net Debt or Public Company Net Debt,
as the case may be, and the other party or parties hereto will consider in
good faith any comments or adjustments to the calculation of Private Company
Net Debt or Public Company Net Debt, as the case may be, and make appropriate
changes in light of any such comments or proposed adjustments. (b) If the
Public Company Net Debt Excess is equal to the Private Company Net Debt
Excess, there shall be no adjustment in the number of shares in the Issuance,
which shall remain as the Base Number of Shares, and, for the avoidance of
doubt, no adjustment to the Additional Cash Payment. (c) If the Public
Company Net Debt Excess less the Private Company Net Debt Excess is a
positive number (the "Positive Debt Amount"), the Base Number of Shares shall
be increased by a number of shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the Positive Debt Amount divided by the Public Company Common
Stock Reference Price; provided that if, as a result of such adjustment, the
Base Number of Shares would be increased by more than 200,000 shares (as may
be adjusted for stock splits, consolidation and other similar corporate
events) (the "Base Number Increase Cap"), then the parties hereto shall
proceed in the following order: (i) Public Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any waiver or consent of any relevant third party to
allow, without requiring any material amendment to any existing agreement
with any such relevant third party, an increase in the Base Number Increase
Cap to permit the full adjustment and increase to the Base Number of Shares,
in which case, the adjustment to the Base Number of Shares in this Section
1.6(c) shall be made without the limitation of the Base Number Increase Cap;
(ii) Public Company may, in its sole discretion, waive the application of the
Base Number Increase Cap and issue a number of additional shares of Public
Company Common Stock in respect of all or part of the Positive Debt Amount,
with each share of Public Company Common Stock being valued at the Public
Company Common Stock Reference Price (provided that such waiver shall not
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, constitute a default,
or give rise to the vesting of any right by any third party or the
acceleration of any material benefit for any third party, pursuant to any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any contract or other agreement,
instrument or obligation of Public Company); and (iii) if such consent or
waiver referenced in sub-clause (i) is not obtained on or prior to the
extended Closing Date contemplated by Section 1.4 and the waiver contemplated
by sub-clause (ii), if made, does not result in the issuance of an additional
number of shares of Public Company Common Stock equal to the Positive Debt
Amount divided by the Public Company Common Stock Reference Price, then (x)
the Additional Cash Payment shall be reduced to an amount (but not less than
zero) equal to ten million US dollars (US$10,000,000) minus the difference
between the Positive Debt Amount and the Cap Value, and the number of
Additional Shares shall equal the Additional Cash Payment as so reduced
divided by the Public Company Common Stock Reference Price, and (y) the Base
Number of Shares shall be adjusted to equal 20,800,000 (as may be adjusted
for stock splits, consolidation and other similar corporate events) plus the
number of shares obtained by dividing the Adjusted Debt Amount by the Public
Company Common Stock Reference Price (with any fractional shares rounded up or
down to the nearest whole share); provided, however, that, for the avoidance
of doubt, the total number of shares of Public Company Common Stock to be
issued to the Stockholder or its designee at Closing shall not exceed
21,633,333 (as may be adjusted for stock splits, consolidation and other
similar corporate events). "Public Company Common Stock Reference Price"
shall mean $12.00 per share of Public Company Common Stock, as may be adjusted  

  

 ![](srtex2131518aegistransac014.jpg) 

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 5 stock splits, consolidation and other similar corporate
events. "Cap Value" shall be an amount equal to two million four hundred
thousand US dollars (US$2,400,000), which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
equal the product of the Base Number Increase Cap and the Public Company
Common Stock Reference Price (not accounting for stock splits, consolidation
and other similar corporate events); provided, however, that if Public
Company waives the application of the Base Number Increase Cap pursuant to
sub-clause (ii), the Cap Value shall be increased to equal the Public Company
Common Stock Reference Price multiplied by the number of shares of Public
Company Common Stock to be issued pursuant to sub-clause (ii). "Adjusted Debt
Amount" means an amount equal to the Positive Debt Amount minus the Cap Value;
provided, however, that if the amount so calculated exceeds ten million US
dollars (US$10,000,000), then the Adjusted Debt Amount shall be deemed to

and operate its properties and assets (either owned or leased) and to carry
on its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified to do business
and, where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such

not reasonably be expected to have a Private Company Material Adverse Effect.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Private Company Material Adverse
Effect" means any effect, fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development,

that no effect, fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or
condition (by itself or when aggregated or taken together with any and all
other effects, facts, circumstances, occurrences, events, developments,
changes or conditions) directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out of,
attributable to, or related to any of the following shall be deemed to be or
constitute a "Private Company Material Adverse Effect," and no effect, fact,
circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition (by itself
or when aggregated or taken together with any and all other such effects,
facts, circumstances, occurrences, events, developments, changes or
conditions) directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out of,
attributable to, or related to any of the following shall be taken into
account when determining whether a "Private Company Material Adverse Effect"
has occurred or may, would or could occur: (i) general economic conditions
(or changes in such conditions) in any country or region in the world, or
conditions in the global economy generally; (ii) conditions (or changes in
such conditions) in the securities markets, credit markets, currency markets
or other financial markets in any country or region in the world, including

changes in such conditions) in the industries in which Private Company and its
Subsidiaries conduct business; (iv) political conditions (or changes in such
conditions) in any country or region in the world or acts of war (whether or
not declared), sabotage or terrorism (including any escalation or general
worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage or terrorism) in any country or
region in the world; (v) earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods,
mudslides, wild fires or other natural disasters, weather conditions and other
force majeure events in any country or region in the world; (vi) the
announcement or pendency of this Agreement or the anticipated consummation of
the Transactions, including the identity of Public Company (including, to the
extent resulting from the foregoing, any effect on any of Private Company's
or any of its Subsidiaries' relationships with their respective customers,
suppliers or employees); (vii) any actions taken or any failure to take
action, in each case, which Public Company has approved, consented to or
requested; or compliance with the terms of, or the taking

thereof), or effects that result from any action taken for the purpose of
complying with any of the foregoing; (ix) any fees or expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions; (x) any failure by Private Company or any of

revenues, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations
(but not, in each case, the underlying cause of such changes or failures,
unless such changes or failures would otherwise be excepted from this
definition); (xi) any events resulting from or arising out of any actions
taken by Public Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Private Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, as required by
this Agreement; or (xii) any action or omission explicitly required under
this Agreement or any action taken or omitted to be taken at the specific

pursuant to and consistent with Section 5.2); except to the extent such
effects directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out of, attributable to

and (viii) disproportionately adversely affect in a material respect Private
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other
companies that conduct business in the countries and regions in the world and
in the industries in which Private Company and its Subsidiaries conduct
business (in which case, such adverse effects (if any) shall be taken into

violate or constitute a misappropriation of any Intellectual Property of any

instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its employees, agents,
attorneys, consultants, contractors, accountants, financial advisors and other
authorized representatives ("Representatives") not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, seek or initiate or knowingly take any action to
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or encourage any
offers, inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal; (ii)

negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal, or furnish to any Person any

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 57 (v) grant any waiver or release under or knowingly fail
to enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement in respect of

would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
obligations to Public Company's stockholders under applicable Law; or (vi)
publicly propose to do any of the foregoing described in clauses (i) through
(v). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, subject to compliance with Section 6.1(c), Public Company may
(A) furnish non-public information with respect to itself and its
Subsidiaries to any Qualified Person (and the Representatives of such
Qualified Person), pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not materially less
restrictive with respect to the confidentiality obligations of the Qualified
Person than the Confidentiality Agreement, or (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations (including solicitation of revised Alternative Proposals) with
any Qualified Person (and the Representatives of such Qualified Person)
regarding any Alternative Proposal. It is understood and agreed that any

pursuant to this Agreement; (B) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Alternative Proposal; (C) fail
to include its recommendation "FOR" the Public Company Stockholder Approval
in the Proxy Statement; or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. (ii) Except as otherwise permitted in this Section 6.1, Public
Company Board shall not (A) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly

Acquisition Agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or

would require Public Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions or (B) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the foregoing.

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 58 (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement (including the provisions of this
Section 6.1), the Public Company Board may effect a Public Company Board
Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal if, prior to
obtaining the Public Company Stockholder Approval: (i) it shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisors) that the failure to effect a Public Company Board
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Public Company stockholders under applicable
Law; (ii) Public Company has provided at least four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice to the Stockholder that it intends to effect a Public Company
Board Recommendation Change, including a description in reasonable detail of
the reasons for such recommendation change, and written copies of any
relevant proposed transaction agreements with any party making a potential
Superior Proposal (a "Recommendation Change Notice") (it being understood
that the Recommendation Change Notice shall not constitute a Public Company
Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); (iii) Public
Company has complied in all material respects with the requirements of this
Section 6.1 in connection with any potential Superior Proposal; and (iv) if
the Stockholder shall have delivered to Public Company a written, binding and
irrevocable offer to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during
the four (4) Business Day period referred to in clause (ii) above, the Public
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisors), after considering the
terms of such offer by the Stockholder, that the failure to effect a Public
Company Board Recommendation Change would still be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Public Company
stockholders under applicable Law. In the event of any material amendment to
any Superior Proposal (including any revision in the amount, form or mix of
consideration Public Company's stockholders would receive as a result of such
potential Superior Proposal), Public Company shall be required to provide the
Stockholder with notice of such material amendment and there shall be a new
four (4) Business Day period following such notification during which Public
Company shall comply again with the requirements of this Section 6.1(b) and
the Public Company Board shall not make a Public Company Board Recommendation
Change prior to the end of any such period. (c) Notices of Proposals. Public
Company will, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt), (i) notify the Stockholder of its
receipt of any Alternative Proposal and (ii) provide to the Stockholder a copy
of such Alternative Proposal (if written), or a summary of the material terms
and conditions of such Alternative Proposal (if oral), including the identity
of the Person making such Alternative Proposal, and copies of all written
communications with such Person with respect to such actual or potential
Alternative Proposal (including a copy of the executed confidentiality
agreement with such Person making such Alternative Proposal). Public Company
shall notify the Stockholder, in writing, of any decision of the Public
Company Board as to whether to consider any Alternative Proposal or to enter
into discussions or negotiations concerning any Alternative Proposal or to
provide non-public information with respect to such to any Person, which
notice shall be given as promptly as practicable after such determination was
reached (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after such
determination was reached). Public Company will (A) provide the Stockholder
with written notice setting forth such information as is reasonably necessary
to keep the Stockholder informed in all material respects of the status and
material terms of any such Alternative Proposal and of any material amendments
or modifications thereto, (B) keep the Stockholder informed as promptly as
practicable with respect  

  

 ![](srtex2131518aegistransac068.jpg) 

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 59 to any changes to the material terms of an Alternative
Proposal submitted to Public Company (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours following any such changes), including by providing a copy of all
written proposals and a summary of all oral proposals or material oral
modifications to an earlier written proposal, in each case relating to any
Alternative Proposal, (C) prior to, or substantially concurrently with, the
provision of any non-public information of Public Company to any such Person,
provide such information to the Stockholder (including by posting such
information to an electronic data room), to the extent such information has
not previously been made available to the Stockholder, and (D) promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such determination) notify the
Stockholder of any determination by the Public Company Board that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. (d) Certain Permitted
Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Public Company Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to
a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder (none of which, in and of itself, shall
be deemed to constitute a Public Company Board Recommendation Change), or
(ii) making any disclosure to Public Company's stockholders if, in the good
faith judgment of the Public Company Board (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors), the failure to disclose would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Public Company stockholders under applicable Law; provided, however, that
notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.1(d), in no event shall
Public Company or the Public Company Board, take, or agree or resolve to
take, any action prohibited by Section 6.1(a) and Section 6.1(b), except as
expressly permitted by Section 6.1(a) and Section 6.1(b). (e) Cessation of
Ongoing Discussions. Public Company shall, and shall direct its
Representatives to, terminate and cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Alternative Proposal; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not in any
way limit or modify the rights of any party hereto under the other provisions
of this Section 6.1. Public Company will immediately revoke or withdraw
access of any Person (other than the Stockholder and its Representatives) to
any data room (virtual or actual) containing any non-public information with
respect to Public Company and request from each third party (other than the
Stockholder and its Representatives) the prompt return or destruction of all
non-public information with respect to Public Company previously provided to
such Person. (f) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the following meanings: (i) "Alternative Proposal" means
any bona fide proposal or offer for (A) a direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase by any Person of more than 25% of the voting or economic interests
of Public Company, (B) a merger, consolidation or sale of all or a material
portion of the assets of one or more of Public Company or its Subsidiaries
involving 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Public Company, or (C) a
recapitalization, liquidation or similar transaction involving one or more of
Public Company or its Subsidiaries and 25% or  

  

 ![](srtex2131518aegistransac069.jpg) 

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 60 more of the consolidated assets of Public Company, in
each case, which is from a third party and is not related to the
Transactions. (ii) "Qualified Person" means any Person making an unsolicited,
bona fide, written third party Alternative Proposal that the Public Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
its financial advisor) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, and such Alternative Proposal has not resulted from a
material breach by Public Company of its obligations under Section 6.1(a).
(iii) "Superior Proposal" means any Alternative Proposal received by Public
Company after the date of this Agreement that (A) is on terms that the Public
Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all
the terms and conditions of the Transactions and of such Alternative Proposal
(including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation thereof, and
all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Alternative
Proposal and this Agreement)) are more favorable to Public Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions (taking
into account any proposed amendment or modification proposed by Stockholder
and Private Company); and (B) the Public Company Board determines (after
receiving the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is
reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms, taking
into account all financial, regulatory, legal, timing and other aspects
(including certainty of closing, certainty of financing and the identity of
the Person making the Alternative Proposal) of such proposal. 6.2 Proxy

reasonably request; provided, however, that (x) Public Company shall not be

in Section 6.1, and (y) no party shall be required to permit any inspection
or other access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of such party would: (1) result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of any third party, (2) violate any legal requirement or contract or

including under any privacy policy, or (3) jeopardize protections afforded
such party under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product
doctrine. Any such information shall be subject to the Confidentiality

to September 21, 2018 upon (i) mutual written consent of Public Company and

cause of or resulted in the failure to obtain the requisite vote of the
stockholders of Public Company in favor of Public Company Voting Proposal or

satisfied and (ii) shall not have been cured within twenty (20) Business Days
following receipt by Public Company of written notice of such breach from the
Stockholder; provided that neither the Stockholder nor Private Company is

party with the knowledge that the taking of such act, or failure to act, would
result in such breach and (b) the provisions of Section 6.5(a)
(Confidentiality), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 8.3

8.1(e); (ii) by Public Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h); or (iii) by
Public Company or the Stockholder, as applicable, pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)
or 8.1(g), so long as (A) prior to the termination of this Agreement, any
Person makes an Alternative Proposal or amends an Alternative Proposal made
prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to Public Company; and (B)
within twelve (12) months after such termination Public Company enters into a

extension of the Outside Date; and (ii) the Public Company Meeting has not

provided all of the Required Financial Information to Public Company on or

with respect to Section 6.2). (d) Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(i) or
Section 8.3(c) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds within two
(2) Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement. Any fee

Public Company be required to pay the Public Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion, whether or not such fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events. Public Company shall not be obligated to pay
(i) the Public Company Termination Fee if it shall have paid the Public
Company Outside Date Fee; or (ii) the Public Company Outside Date Fee if it
shall have paid the Public Company Termination Fee; provided, however, for
the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Stockholder is entitled to both
the Public Company Termination Fee and the Public Company Outside Date Fee,

event that Public Company fails to pay the Public Company Termination Fee or
the Public Company Outside Date Fee, as applicable, when due, such fee shall
accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 76 fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, became past
due, at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in the Money Rates
Section of The Wall Street Journal. (f) The parties hereto acknowledge that
the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement
absent such agreements. Notwithstanding Section 8.2 or any other provision of
this Agreement, payment of the fees described in this Section 8.3 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Stockholder and Private
Company in connection with any termination of this Agreement in the
circumstances in which such fees became payable. In the event that the
Stockholder shall receive the payment of a fee described in this Section 8.3,
the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Stockholder, Private
Company and any of their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and
the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither the Stockholder,
Private Company nor any of their Affiliates, shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against Public Company or any
of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the Transactions or
any matters forming the basis for such termination. 8.4 Amendment. This
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after
approval of the matters presented for approval by the stockholder of Public
Company, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time
prior to the Closing, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not
apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may
be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The
failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 8.6 Procedure for
Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment, modification or supplement of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an extension or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.5 shall, in order to be effective, require action by
Public Company Board and the Stockholder, respectively; provided, however,
that after any such approval by the stockholders of Public Company, no
amendment shall be made without the further approval of such stockholders
except as permitted by applicable Law. This Agreement (including the Public
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Private Company Disclosure Schedule) may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto.

any other means (including personal delivery, messenger service, or ordinary
mail), but no such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been
duly given unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom it

other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other

This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the documents
and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties hereto and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto
specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings, agreements
or representations to the extent not embodied in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in

Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies hereunder, except as set forth in or contemplated by the
terms and provisions of Section 6.8 (with respect to which the Indemnified

Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior
written consent shall be null and void; provided, however, that the
Stockholder may assign this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
parties to any Subsidiary, whether existing as of the date hereof or after,
but no such assignment shall relieve the Stockholder from any of its
obligations under this Agreement if the applicable assignee does not perform
such obligations. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 79 9.6 Severability. Any term or provision (or part
thereof) of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation
in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remaining terms and provisions (or parts thereof) hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision (or part thereof) in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision (or part
thereof) hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision (or part
thereof), to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a term or provision
(or part thereof) that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or
part thereof), and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto shall replace such invalid or unenforceable term
or provision (or part thereof) with a valid and enforceable term or provision
(or part thereof) that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term (or part
thereof). 9.7 Counterparts and Signature. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan
delivered by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but

parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by
electronic mail. 9.8 Interpretation. Except where expressly stated otherwise
in this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this
Agreement: (a) "either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include", "includes"
and "including" shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
"without limitation"; (b) "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement; (c) "date hereof" refers to the date set forth in the preamble of
this Agreement; (d) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply
"if"; (e) descriptive headings, the table of defined terms and the table of
contents are inserted for convenience only and do not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement; (f) definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms; (g) references to a Person are also to its permitted successors
and assigns; (h) references to an "Article", "Section", "Recital",
"introductory paragraph", "Annex", "Exhibit" or "Schedule" refer to an
Article, Section, Recital or introductory paragraph of, or an Annex, Exhibit
or Schedule to, this Agreement; (i) references to "$," "US$," or otherwise to
dollar amounts refer to the lawful currency of the United States; (j)
references to a federal, state, local or foreign statute or law include any
rules, regulations and delegated legislation issued thereunder; and (k)
references to a communication by a regulatory agency include a communication

mean that such information was either (A) publicly available on the SEC's
EDGAR system prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) included in Public
Company's electronic data room no later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
date of this Agreement or (C) provided  

  

 ![](srtex2131518aegistransac089.jpg) 

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 80 directly to Private Company or its counsel, and (ii)
with respect to information that has been "made available" to Public Company,
that shall mean that such information was either (i) included in Private
Company's electronic data room no later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
date of this Agreement or (ii) provided directly to Public Company or its
counsel. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party hereto. No
summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. 9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State
of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of
the State of Delaware. 9.10 Remedies. (a) Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Person will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and the exercise by a Person of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. (b)
Irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, as money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by Public Company, on the one hand, or Private Company
or the Stockholder, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants
or obligations set forth in this Agreement, and Public Company, on the one
hand, and Private Company and the Stockholder, on the other hand, as
applicable, shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement, in each case without posting a
bond or other security. In circumstances where the parties are obligated to
consummate the Transactions and the Transactions have not been consummated
(other than as a result of the other party's refusal to close in violation of
this Agreement), each of the parties expressly acknowledges and agrees that
the other party and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm,
that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party and
its stockholders, and that such other party on behalf of itself and its
stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically the breaching party's
obligation to consummate the Transactions. No party hereto shall raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by Private Company or the Stockholder, or to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
Private Company or the Stockholder under this Agreement.

NYDOCS02/1142212.8 81 9.11 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties
hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if
that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, (b) agrees that all claims in respect
of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such court,
(c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (d)

this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any other court, and (e) waives
any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising

might be required of any other Person with respect thereto. Any party hereto
may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided

however, shall affect the right of any Person to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by applicable Law. 9.12 Disclosure Schedule. Each of
the Private Company Disclosure Schedule and the Public Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered sections
contained in this Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify
(a) the corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) the other sections of
this Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading
of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections.
The inclusion of any information in the Private Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Public Company Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, shall not be deemed
to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information
is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Private Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Public Company Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or
is outside the Ordinary Course of Business. [Remainder of Page Intentionally
