If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any &#13;&#10;term or provision (or part thereof) hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the court making such &#13;&#10;determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision (or part thereof), to delete &#13;&#10;specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part &#13;&#10;thereof) with a term or provision (or part thereof) that is valid and enforceable and that comes &#13;&#10;closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part &#13;&#10;thereof), and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  In the event such court does &#13;&#10;not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto shall replace such &#13;&#10;invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a valid and enforceable term or &#13;&#10;provision (or part thereof) that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and &#13;&#10;other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term (or part thereof). &#13;&#10;9.7 Counterparts and Signature.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more &#13;&#10;counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail), each &#13;&#10;of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the &#13;&#10;same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the &#13;&#10;parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign &#13;&#10;the same counterpart.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in &#13;&#10;accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or &#13;&#10;conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that &#13;&#10;would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of &#13;&#10;Delaware. &#13;&#10;9.10 Remedies. &#13;&#10;(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein &#13;&#10;expressly conferred upon a Person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any &#13;&#10;other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and the exercise by a &#13;&#10;Person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. &#13;&#10;(b) Irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this &#13;&#10;Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, &#13;&#10;as money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such &#13;&#10;damages.  Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Public Company, on &#13;&#10;the one hand, or Private Company or the Stockholder, on the other hand, of any of their &#13;&#10;respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, and Public Company, on the one &#13;&#10;hand, and Private Company and the Stockholder, on the other hand, as applicable, shall be &#13;&#10;entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, &#13;&#10;including monetary damages) to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or &#13;&#10;threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically enforce &#13;&#10;the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to &#13;&#10;enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement, in &#13;&#10;each case without posting a bond or other security.  In circumstances where the parties are &#13;&#10;obligated to consummate the Transactions and the Transactions have not been consummated &#13;&#10;(other than as a result of the other party&#8217;s refusal to close in violation of this Agreement), each of &#13;&#10;the parties expressly acknowledges and agrees that the other party and its stockholders shall have &#13;&#10;suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other &#13;&#10;party and its stockholders, and that such other party on behalf of itself and its stockholders shall &#13;&#10;be entitled to enforce specifically the breaching party&#8217;s obligation to consummate the &#13;&#10;Transactions.  No party hereto shall raise any objections to the availability of the equitable &#13;&#10;remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this &#13;&#10;Agreement by Private Company or the Stockholder, or to specifically enforce the terms and &#13;&#10;provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce &#13;&#10;compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Private Company or the Stockholder under &#13;&#10;this Agreement.  &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</FONT></DIV>
