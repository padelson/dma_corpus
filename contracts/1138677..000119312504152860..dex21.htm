AGREEMENT

AND

PLAN OF REORGANIZATION



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") entered into as of the
1st day of September, 2004, by and between FIRST COMMUNITY CAPITAL CORPORATION
("Company"), a Texas corporation, and WELLS FARGO and COMPANY ("Wells Fargo"),
a Delaware corporation.



WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to effect a reorganization whereby a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo will merge with and into Company (the
"Merger") pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement")
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, which provides, among
other things, for the conversion of the shares of Common Stock of Company, of
the par value of $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), and of the
Companys Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, each of the
par value of $0.01 per share ("Preferred Stock"), outstanding immediately
prior to the time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with the
provisions of the Merger Agreement into the right to receive shares of voting
Common Stock of Wells Fargo of the par value of $1-2/3 per share ("Wells Fargo
Common Stock").



NOW, THEREFORE, to effect such reorganization and in consideration of the
premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto do hereby represent, warrant, covenant, and agree as follows:



1\. Basic Plan of Reorganization



(a)  _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo (the "Merger Co.") will be merged by
statutory merger with and into Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement, with
Company as the surviving corporation, in which merger each share of Company
Common Stock and each share of Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger (as defined in paragraph 1(f) below)
(other than shares as to which statutory dissenters appraisal rights have
been exercised and other than shares of Company Common Stock and Preferred
Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Wells Fargo or the Company (other than
shares of Company Common Stock and Preferred Stock held, directly or
indirectly, in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties,
and any shares of Company Common Stock and Preferred Stock held by
the Company or Wells Fargo or any of their respective subsidiaries in respect
of a debt previously contracted)) will be converted into the right to receive,
and exchanged for certificates or direct registration statements representing
the number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock determined by dividing the
Adjusted Wells Fargo Shares by the number of Company Common Stock and
Preferred Stock and "Company Stock Options" (as defined in paragraph 1(b)
below) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Merger
Exchange Ratio"). The "Adjusted Wells Fargo Shares" shall be a number equal to (A) $123,655,000 minus the Grimes County Tax Amount divided by
(B) the Wells Fargo Measurement Price, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth.
The "Wells Fargo Measurement Price" is defined as the average of the closing
prices of a share of Wells Fargo Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
only as reported by Bloomberg LP for each of the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the meeting of
shareholders required by paragraph 4(c) of this Agreement, rounded to the
nearest ten-thousandth.



(b) _Conversion of Company Options_. At the Effective Time of the Merger,
each option (granted by Company or, in the case of stock options of acquired
entities, assumed by Company) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under
any stock option plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans") which
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Date of the
Merger (each, a "Company Stock Option"), shall cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of the Company Common Stock and shall be
converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock (each, a "Substitute Option") in an amount and at an exercise
price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the
Company Stock Option Plans).



(i) The number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock to be subject to the
Substitute Option shall be the product (rounded down to the nearest share) of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock
Option and the Merger Exchange Ratio; and



(ii) The exercise price per share of Wells Fargo Common Stock under the
Substitute Option shall be equal to the result (rounded down to the nearest
cent) of dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under
the Company Stock Option by the Merger Exchange Ratio.



The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options that are "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be effected in a
manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.



(c) _Wells Fargo Common Stock Adjustments_. If, between the date hereof and
the Effective Time of the Merger as defined below, shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different
class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period (a "Common
Stock Adjustment"), then the number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock
issuable pursuant to subparagraph (a), above, will be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted so that the number of such shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock issuable in the Merger will equal the number of shares of Wells
Fargo Common Stock which holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
Preferred Stock would have received pursuant to such Common Stock Adjustment
had the record date therefor been immediately following the Effective Time of
the Merger.



(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock and
no certificates or scrip certificates therefor shall be issued to represent
any such fractional interest, and any holder thereof shall be paid an amount
of cash equal to the product obtained by



 

2 multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder is entitled by
the average of the closing prices of a share of Wells Fargo Common Stock on
the New York Stock Exchange only as reported by Bloomberg LP for each of the
five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the
meeting of shareholders required by paragraph 4(c) of this Agreement.



(e) _Treasury Shares_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock and Preferred Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or by
Wells Fargo, other than Trust Account Shares or DPC Shares, shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and no capital stock of Wells Fargo or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(f) _Mechanics of Closing Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Merger Agreement shall be executed and it or Articles of
Merger or a Certificate of Merger shall be filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Texas within two (2) business days following the satisfaction
or waiver of all conditions precedent set forth in Sections 6 and 7 of this
Agreement or on such other date as may be agreed to by the parties (the
"Closing Date"),  _provided_ that the Closing Date shall not occur on the
last business day of a calendar month. Each of the parties agrees to use its
best efforts to cause the Merger to be completed as soon as practicable after
the receipt of final regulatory approval of the Merger and the expiration of
all required waiting periods. The time that the filing referred to in the
first sentence of this paragraph is made is herein referred to as the "Time of
Filing." The day on which such filing is made and accepted is herein referred
to as the "Effective Date of the Merger." The "Effective Time of the Merger"
shall be 11:59 p.m., Central time, on the Effective Date of the Merger. At the
Effective Time of the Merger on the Effective Date of the Merger, the
separate existence of Merger Co. shall cease and Merger Co. will be merged
with and into Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement.



The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on the Closing Date at the offices
of counsel for the Company, Bracewell and Patterson, LLP, Houston, Texas.



(g) _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At Wells Fargos election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that (i) Company is merged with and
into any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo, (ii)
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo is merged with
and into Company, or (iii) Company is merged with and into Wells Fargo; 
_provided, however_ , that no such change shall (A) alter or change the amount
or kind of consideration to be issued to Companys shareholders in the Merger
or under such alternative structure (the "Merger Consideration"),
(B) adversely affect the tax treatment of Companys shareholders as a result
of receiving the Merger Consideration or prevent the parties from obtaining
the opinion referred to in Paragraph 6(h), or (C) materially impede or delay
consummation of the Merger or the Spin-Off. In the event of such election,
the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in
order to reflect such election.



(h) _Grimes County Tax Amount_. The "Grimes County Tax Amount" shall be an
amount equal to aggregate tax (including penalties and interest) due on the
Grimes County Tax Returns (as defined in paragraph 4(t)) plus any out-of-
pocket expenses (including attorney fees) incurred by Company in connection
with the "Grimes County Tax Matter" between the date hereof and the Closing
Date; _provided, however,_ that such amount shall be reduced by the



 

3 Grimes County Tax Refund Amount. The "Grimes County Tax Refund Amount" shall
mean any tax refund to which the Company is entitled to receive relating to
the Grimes County Tax Matter for which there has been a Final Resolution. The
"Grimes County Tax Matter" shall mean the filing of any tax refund claim for
Grimes County Capital Corporation for the tax period ending on January 6,
2004. A "Final Resolution" shall mean a closing agreement executed between a
federal taxing authority (with respect to a federal refund claim) or a state
taxing authority (with respect to a state refund claim) and the Company
pursuant to Section 7121(b) of the Code (or similar state statute or law) to
ensure that there is "finality" to the closing agreement as prescribed in
Section 7121(b) of the Code. The Grimes County Tax Refund Amount shall be
zero if a Final Resolution does not occur on or before the Closing Date;
_provided, however_ , that the Company shall receive credit toward the Grimes
County Tax Refund Amount for the amount of any third-party payments received
(net of any tax cost and any out-of-pocket expenses associated with such
payments from the date hereof) by the Company with respect to the Grimes
County Tax Amount on or before the Closing Date. If a valid election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code is made with respect to the January 6, 2004
acquisition of Community State Bank ("Grimes 338(h)(10) Election"), the Grimes
County Tax Amount shall be reduced by any tax benefit subsequently recognized
from the ability of Company to deduct any loss in the tax year of the "Spin-
Off" (as defined in paragraph 4(s)) attributable to additional tax basis
resulting from the Grimes 338(h)(10) Election (including any deferred
intercompany loss within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-13(b)(2) or any
loss on the sale of the stock of First Community Bank San Antonio, N.A.). Any
claims for third-party payments (excluding any tax refund claim) relating to
the Grimes County Tax Amount which are not made before the Closing Date will
be for the benefit of the shareholders of the Company (on a net of tax basis)
immediately before the Effective Time of the Merger pursuant to a distribution
or assignment agreement the terms of which are agreed to by Company and Wells
Fargo prior to the Closing Date.

authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to the best
knowledge of Company, no

does not violate or infringe, in any respect material to any such business,

whole.

Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained, and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical, or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be excepted to have a materially adverse
effect on the system internal accounting controls described in the following

the SEC prior to the date hereof, Company and its Subsidiaries have devised
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Company (A) has designed disclosure controls and

questioning the validity or effectiveness of any license or agreement
relating to such Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of the Company, the
current use by Company and each Company Subsidiary of the Intellectual
Property does not infringe on the rights of any person, except for
such infringements which in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect upon Companys ownership or use of



 

14 such Intellectual Property. There are no pending claims or charges brought by
Company or any Company Subsidiary against any person with respect to the use

a director or officer of Company or any Company Subsidiary (an "Indemnified
Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), to the same extent as
Company is obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified
Parties in Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws or similar governing
documents of any Company Subsidiary, as applicable in the particular case and
as in effect on the date hereof, with respect to claims arising from (A) facts
or events that occurred before the Effective Time of the Merger, or (B) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time of the
Merger. Nothing contained in this paragraph 5(m)(i) shall be deemed to
preclude the liquidation, consolidation, or merger of Company or any
Company Subsidiary, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and
limitations on liability shall be deemed to survive and continue as
contractual rights notwithstanding any such liquidation or consolidation or
merger; _provided, however_ , that in the event of liquidation or sale of
substantially all of the assets of Company, Wells Fargo shall guarantee, to
the extent of the net asset value of Company or any Company Subsidiary as of
the Effective Date of the Merger, the indemnification obligations of Company
or any Company Subsidiary to the extent of indemnification obligations of
Company and the Company Subsidiaries described above. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this paragraph 5(m)(i), nothing contained in
this Agreement shall require Wells Fargo to indemnify any person who was a
director or officer of Company or any Company Subsidiary to a greater extent
than Company or any Company Subsidiary is, as of the date of this Agreement,
required to indemnify any such person;



(ii) any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
5(m)(i), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, shall promptly notify Wells Fargo thereof, but the failure to
so notify shall not relieve Wells Fargo of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding,
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time of the
Merger) (A) Wells Fargo shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and Wells Fargo shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Wells Fargo elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Party advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between
Wells Fargo and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain
counsel satisfactory to it/them, and Wells Fargo shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements
therefor are received, _provided, however_ , that Wells Fargo shall be
obligated pursuant to this subparagraph (ii) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest, and (B) such Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter;



 

30 (iii) for a period of three (3) years after the Effective Time of the Merger,
Wells Fargo shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Company (
_provided_ that Wells Fargo may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions which are
substantially no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from facts
or events which occurred before the Effective Time of the Merger; _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall Wells Fargo be obligated to expend, in
order to maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant to this paragraph
5(m)(iii), any amount per annum in excess of 150% of the amount of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof by Company for such insurance
(the "Maximum Amount") and _provided, further,_ that, prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, Company shall notify the appropriate directors and
officers liability insurers of the Merger and of all pending or
threatened claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations asserted or
claimed against any Indemnified Party, or circumstances likely to give rise
thereto to the extent known to the Company, in accordance with terms and
conditions of the applicable policies. If the amount of the annual premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Wells Fargo shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount;



(iv) if Wells Fargo or any of its successors or assigns (A) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (B) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Wells
Fargo shall assume the obligations set forth in this paragraph 5(m); and



(v) the provisions of this paragraph 5(m) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives.

Form S-8 or other appropriate form (and use its best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness thereof) all shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock issuable
pursuant to the Substitute Options, (ii) cause such shares to be authorized
