1.6 _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by Georgia Law and such Articles of Incorporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Article I of the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation will be amended as of the Effective Time to read: "The name of the
corporation is Scientific-Atlanta, Inc."



(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by Georgia Law, the Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.



1.7 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors
and officers of Sub, as constituted immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



 

-5- 1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_.



(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Common Stock:



(i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.8(b)) shall be converted into
the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.10(c), an
amount of cash equal to the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest. As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.8(b)) shall automatically be
cancelled and no longer deemed outstanding, and the holders thereof shall not
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per-
Share Cash Amount, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates (as
defined in Section 1.10) in accordance with Section 1.10.



(ii) At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Sub that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of
the Merger and without further action on the part of the sole shareholder of
Sub, be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation (and the shares of Surviving Corporation into which the shares of
Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporations capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after
the Effective Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Sub
common stock will evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by the Company and Parent_. At
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.



(c) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Common Stock
or Parent Common Stock occurring after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers
of shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations
provided for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or
trading prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the
extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.



(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein and except as provided in this Section 1.8(d), no Dissenting Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per-Share Cash Amount
but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration
as may be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Georgia Law.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of Georgia
Law, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive
payment therefor in accordance with Article 13 of Georgia Law (but only after
the value of such Dissenting Shares shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to the provisions of Georgia Law). The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any such demands received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
Georgia Law and received by the Company, and (ii) the right to direct all
negotiations and  



 

-6-  proceedings with respect to such demands under Georgia Law. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. If, after
the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares lose their status as Dissenting
Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to
receive the Per-Share Cash Amount without interest pursuant to Section 1.8(a)
in respect of such shares as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares,
and Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly
as reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or times, following the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions, in each case as set forth in
Section 1.10(c), the amount of cash to which such holder would be entitled in
respect thereof under Section 1.8(a) as if such shares never had been
Dissenting Shares (and all such cash shall be deemed for all purposes of this
Agreement to have become deliverable to such holder pursuant to Section
1.8(a)).



1.9 _Company Options_.

 



(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, all Company Options then
outstanding under each Company Option Plan shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with Section 5.11.



(b) _Reserved but Unissued Shares_. At the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock then reserved under the Specified Target Plan shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.11.



1.10 _Surrender of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parents transfer agent, EquiServe Trust Company N.A.,
shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.



(b) _Parent to Deposit Cash_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, to deliver to
the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I the cash
payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a).



(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates ("Certificates") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (i) a
letter of transmittal (that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain
such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii)
instructions for use of such letter of transmittal in effecting surrender of
Certificates in exchange for the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a). Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, each holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check for the cash amount
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in
respect of such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Cash Amount pursuant
to Section 1.8(a) for each share of Company Common Stock to which such
certificate relates.



(d) _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) or Section 1.9(a). 



 

-7- (e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.8(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.



(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.10, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.



(g) _Unclaimed Cash_. Any portion of funds held by the Exchange Agent which
have not been delivered to any holders of Certificates pursuant to this
Article I within six months after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid to
Parent, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore
complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by Section
1.10(c) shall look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) for its claim, only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to
the cash payable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the consideration payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts
payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.



1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid or
payable following the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be so paid or
payable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, such Certificate shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.



1.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the record holder thereof, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such Certificate the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in
respect of such Certificate; provided, however, that Parent or the Exchange
Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to
the exchange thereof, require the record holder of such Certificate to
deliver a bond in such sum as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and/or any of their respective
representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate.



1.13 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement,
the shares deliverable upon exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent
pursuant to this Agreement, and from any other payments otherwise required
pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder of any shares of Company Common
Stock, any Company Options or any Certificates such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code, any provision
of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax law, or pursuant to other
applicable judgments, decrees, injunctions or orders. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld  



 

-8-  amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
delivered and paid to such holders in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

Company regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any Tax consequences to
the Company of this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions or
agreements contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that the Company is
relying solely on its own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated hereby.



1.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in
the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action
necessary or desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts so long as
such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY _



Subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure letter of the Company
delivered to Parent and Sub concurrently with the parties execution of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter") (each of which exceptions, in
order to be effective, shall clearly indicate the Section and, if applicable,
the Subsection of this Article II to which it relates (unless and to the

as follows:



2.1 _Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries_.

and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership of its properties makes such qualification
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has made available
to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of the Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, as applicable, of the
Company and each Scheduled Subsidiary, in each case as amended and in effect
on the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any Scheduled Subsidiary is in

(b) Between November 15, 2005 and the date of this Agreement, the Company has
not issued any Company Common Stock or other securities (including any
Convertible Security) other than pursuant to the exercise of Company Options
outstanding as of November 15, 2005. All issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and are free of all Encumbrances, preemptive rights, rights of
first refusal and "put" or "call" rights created by statute, the Articles of

Company Common Stock and such Company Options. There is no liability for
dividends accrued and unpaid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other

list of all holders of outstanding Company Options, including the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such option, the date of grant,
the exercise or vesting schedule, the extent exercisable or issued as
of November 15, 2005, and the exercise price per share. No Company Option is
intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the
Code.



(d) _Schedule 2.2(d)_ to the Company Disclosure Letter accurately lists all
items of Debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries involving an amount of
$1,000,000 or more, including, for each item of Debt, the agreement governing
the Debt and the interest rate, maturity date and any assets or properties
securing such Debt.



(e) The terms of each of the Company Option Plans and the applicable stock
option agreements permit the assumption by Parent of all outstanding Company
Options, whether vested or unvested, as provided in this Agreement, without
the consent or approval of the holders of such securities, the
Company shareholders, or otherwise. All Company Options outstanding as of the
date  



 

-11-  hereof will accelerate in full not later than consummation of the Merger.
True, correct and complete copies of each of the Company Option Plans and
the standard form of all agreements and instruments relating to or issued
under each Company Option Plan and all agreements and instruments relating to
or issued under the Company Option Plans or Company Options that differ in any
material respect from such standard form agreements have been made available
to Parent, and such agreements and instruments have not been amended, modified
or supplemented in any material respect since being made available to Parent,

available to Parent.



2.3 _Authority; Noncontravention_.



(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the Company Shareholder Approval (as defined
below), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and, subject to the Company Shareholder Approval,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by each of the
other parties hereto, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
only to the effect, if any, of (i) applicable bankruptcy and other similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, and (ii) rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. The Company Board, by resolutions duly adopted (and not thereafter
modified or rescinded) by the unanimous vote of the full Company Board, has
(i) adopted this Agreement, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the terms
and conditions of the Merger and this Agreement are fair to, advisable and in
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and (iii) directed
that the approval of this Agreement be submitted to the Company shareholders
for consideration and recommended that all of the Company shareholders approve
this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of Parents representations and
warranties in Section 3.4 of this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of all shares of the Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding on the record date set for the meeting of the Companys
shareholders to adopt this Agreement and the Merger (such approval, the
"Company Shareholder Approval," and such shareholders meeting, the "Company
Shareholders Meeting") is the only vote of the holders of capital stock
of the Company necessary to approve this Agreement under applicable Legal
Requirements and the Companys Articles of Incorporation.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) result
in the creation of any Encumbrance on any of the material properties or assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) conflict with, or result in
any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation or loss of any benefit under, or require any consent,
approval or waiver from any Person pursuant to, (A) any provision of
the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to date, (B) subject to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and
compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 2.3(c), any material
Legal Requirement applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets, or (C) any Material Contract (as
defined in Section 2.18), other than, in the case of (B) and (C) above, such
conflicts, violations, defaults, Encumbrances, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations, losses, consents, approvals or waivers as would not be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



(c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation  



 

-12-  of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger, as provided in Section 1.4, (ii) such filings as may
be required under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Law (as
defined in Section 5.6), (iii) any filings required to be made with the NYSE,
(iv) the filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section
2.21) and such reports as may be required under the Exchange Act in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(v) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals, notices
and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and would not prevent,
materially alter or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(d) The Company Board has taken all necessary action to render the Rights
Agreement inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby will result in the occurrence of a "Distribution Date" (as defined in
the Rights Agreement) or otherwise cause the Rights to become exercisable by
the holders thereof. Assuming the accuracy of Parents representations and
warranties in Section 3.4 of this Agreement, the approval of this Agreement by
the Company Board referred to in Section 2.3(a) constitutes all approvals that
are necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby the provisions of Section 14-2-1111 and
Section 14-2-1132 of Georgia Law and represent the only actions necessary to
ensure that Section 14-2-1111 and Section 14-2-1132 of Georgia Law do not and
will not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger. No other state takeover or similar statute or
regulation is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby that would interfere with Parents
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



2.4 _SEC Filings; Company Financial Statements_.



(a) The Company has filed on a timely basis all forms, statements, schedules,
reports and documents (including items incorporated by reference) required to
be filed by the Company with the SEC since July 1, 2002. All such required
forms, statements, schedules, reports and documents (including those that the
Company may file subsequent to the date of this Agreement) are referred to
herein as the "Company SEC Reports." As of their respective filing dates, the
Company SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with, to the extent
in effect at the time of filing with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and (ii) did not at the
time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent corrected prior to the date of this Agreement by a subsequently
filed Company SEC Report. None of the Subsidiaries is subject to reporting
requirements pursuant to the Exchange Act.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the
"Financial Statements"), , (i) complied as to form in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,

throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes

Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of Companys and
its Subsidiaries operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except
that the unaudited interim financial statements may not contain footnotes and
were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end  



 

-13-  adjustments. The balance sheet of the Company as of July 1, 2005 (the
"Company Balance Sheet Date") contained in the Company SEC Reports is
hereinafter referred to as the "Company Balance Sheet." Except as disclosed in
the Financial Statements, since the Company Balance Sheet Date, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, created, assumed or become
subject to any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise)
required under GAAP to be set forth on a balance sheet of the Company prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis which are, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of operations or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
except for: (i) liabilities incurred since the Company Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, (ii) those
set forth or adequately provided for in the Company Balance Sheet, and (iii)
the fees and expenses of investment bankers, attorneys, consultants and
accountants incurred in connection with this Agreement. Except as reflected
in the Financial Statements, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item
303 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act ("Regulation S-K")).
The Financial Statements comply in all material respects with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-2 for the
products covered by such standard. The Company has not had any material
dispute with any of its auditors regarding accounting matters or policies
during any of its past three full fiscal years or during the current fiscal
year that is currently outstanding or that resulted in a passed adjustment
to, or any restatement of, the Financial Statements.



(c) No investigation by the SEC with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is, to the knowledge of the Company, pending or threatened.



(d) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material
information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the "principal
executive officer" and the "principal financial officer" of the Company
required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOXA") with
respect to such reports. Each of the principal executive officer of the
Company and the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former
principal executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial
officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required by
Sections 302 and 906 of SOXA and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Reports and the statements
contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all material
respects as of the date hereof. The Company has prepared a plan that
complies with the requirements of Section 404 of SOXA and a copy of such plan
has been provided to Parent. There are no "significant deficiencies" or
"material weaknesses" (as defined by SOXA) in the design or operation of
the Companys internal controls and procedures which could adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data.
The Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b) of
Regulation S-K for senior financial, accounting and compliance officers and
those performing similar functions. The Company has disclosed any violation or
waiver of such code of ethics, as required by Section 406(b) of SOXA. To the
Companys knowledge, there is no fraud or any material violation of the
Companys code of ethics that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls and procedures.



(e) The audit committee of the Company Board includes an "audit committee
financial expert," as defined by Item 401(h)(2) of Regulation S-K. To the
Companys  



 

-14-  knowledge, Ernst and Young LLP, which has expressed its opinion with respect
to the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of June
28, 2002, June 27, 2003, July 2, 2004 and July 1, 2005 and for each of the
fiscal years in the four-year period ended July 1, 2005 included in the
Company SEC Reports (including the related notes), is "independent" with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of Regulation
S-X since June 28, 2002. The Company has made such disclosure of non-audit
services performed by Ernst and Young LLP in its proxy statements with respect
to its annual meetings of shareholders as is required under the rules and
regulations of the SEC and all such non-audit services have been approved in
accordance with the pre-approval processes of the audit committee of

control agreements or severance agreements, written or otherwise, for the

with respect to each Company Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA
reporting requirements, made available to Parent true, correct and complete

401(a) of the Code, the Company or the ERISA Affiliate, as applicable, has
either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination
letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to

sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer. The Company has also made
available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of the most recent
Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letter issued with respect
to each such Company Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred since the
issuance of each such letter that could reasonably be expected to cause
revocation of any such determination letters. The Company has also made

violation of, and has no knowledge of any material default or violation by any
other party to, any of the Company Employee Plans. There have been no
"prohibited transactions" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for which an exemption does not apply) with respect
to any Company Employee Plan which could result in a material liability. All
contributions required to be made by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before
their due dates. Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms,

Subsidiary (other than ordinary expenses typically incurred in a termination
event and other than for liabilities accrued as of the date of the
termination).



(d) No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been
brought, or to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened, against the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Company Employee Plan,
including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or United
States Department of Labor (other than routine claims for benefits). There is
no Company Employee Plan that, considered individually or considered
collectively with any other Company Employee Plan or other payment, will, or
could reasonably be expected to, as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events), give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that
could reasonably be expected to be non-deductible under Section 162(m) of the
Code or characterized as an excess "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code.



(e) There has been no amendment to, or written interpretation or written
announcement by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or other ERISA Affiliate

entitlements (including entitlements under any executive compensation,

associated with post-employment welfare benefits (including any retiree health
benefits and life insurance) of employees and former employees of
the Company, its ERISA Affiliates and their respective beneficiaries, other

provisions of Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, have been fully reflected on the Financial Statements to the extent
required by and in accordance with GAAP.

the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) the fair market

the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid in
full; (iv) no liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV
of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates; and (v) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate
any such Company Employee Plan and no condition exists that is reasonably
expected to present a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which
is reasonably  



 

-26-  expected to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the
termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such
Company Employee Plan.



(h) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or during the
preceding six (6) years has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any

accrued liability on the Company Balance Sheet to the extent required by
applicable accounting requirements, (iii) the Company, each of its
Subsidiaries, and each ERISA Affiliate has materially complied with all
applicable reporting and notice requirements, and such Foreign Plan has
obtained from the Governmental Entity having jurisdiction with respect to such
Foreign Plan any required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Plan is in
compliance with the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, and (iv) to the
knowledge of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, there are no pending
investigations by any governmental body involving such Foreign Plan, and no
pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the normal

of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

or would be reasonably likely to facilitate, an Acquisition Proposal or that

consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any sale, transfer or disposition, or

interest, proposal, notice or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or (C) any request for non-
public information which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, as well as, in the event of any of (A)-(C) above, the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,  



 

-42-  expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request, and the identity
of the Person or Group making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,

Business Day after receipt) of the status and details (including any
amendments, modifications or proposed amendments or modifications) of any
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer,
notice or request, and provide to Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no
event more than one Business Day after receipt) a copy of all written

is reasonably expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal, including to
determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer (as defined
in Section 5.3(c)).



(c) _Superior Offers_. In the event that any Person submits to the Company
(and does not withdraw) an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board reasonably concludes in good faith (after
receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national standing) is, or is reasonably likely to become, a Superior Offer,
then notwithstanding Section 5.3(a), the Company may, so long as the
Company Shareholder Approval has not yet been obtained, (i) enter into
discussions with such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal, and (ii)
deliver or make available to such Person nonpublic information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries, _provided_ , in every case, that the Company,
its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives comply with each of the
following: (A) neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company
Representative shall have violated in any material respect any of the

provided Parent with written notice of the identity of such Person and all of
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of the

terms at least as restrictive with regard to Companys confidential
information as the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.5),

obligations under the Agreement and shall require such Person to agree to
customary non-solicitation provisions covering at least 12 months from
execution of such confidentiality agreement, and (D) prior to or

or other business combination (including by means of a tender offer followed

Company or more than 50% of the total outstanding voting securities of the
Company and as a result of which the shareholders of the Company immediately
preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the equity interests in
the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any direct or
indirect parent or subsidiary thereof, for consideration consisting
exclusively of cash and/or publicly-traded equity securities on terms that
the Company Board has in its good faith judgment concluded (following
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), taking
into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the offer, including conditions to consummation and the Person
making the offer, would be, if consummated, more favorable, from a financial
point of view, to the Companys shareholders (in their capacities as
shareholders) than the terms of the Merger, is reasonably likely to be
consummated.

making such Superior Offer;



(iv) Parent shall not have, within four Business Days of Parents receipt of
the Notice of Superior Offer, made an offer that the Company Board concludes
in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of

as such Superior Offer (it being agreed that (A) the Company Board shall
convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the
receipt thereof, (B) that the Company Board will not withhold, withdraw or
modify its recommendation to the Companys shareholders in favor of
the Company Shareholder Approval until the earlier of the receipt of Parents
revised offer or four Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice of
Superior Offer, and (C) any change to the financial or other material terms of
such Superior Offer shall require a new Notice of Superior Offer to Parent
and a new four Business Day period under this clause (vi)); and



(v) the Company Board has concluded in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer
and any offer made by Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(iv), the Company Board
is required to withhold, withdraw, or modify such recommendation in order to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under
applicable Legal Requirements.



(e)  _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however __,_ that the Company Board shall not recommend
that Company shareholders tender shares of Company capital stock in connection
with any tender or exchange offer, or withhold, withdraw or modify its
recommendation to the Companys shareholders in favor of the Company
Shareholder Approval unless permitted to do so pursuant to Section 5.3(d).



(f) _Shareholder Disclosures_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from making any disclosure to the shareholders of the
Company if the Company Board has concluded in its good faith judgment (after

is required in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements or to comply with
applicable securities laws.

claim, or any written inquiry by any Taxing Authority, regarding a material
deficiency to pay Taxes payable by the Company; or (vi) any event that occurs
after the date of this Agreement, that had it occurred prior to the date of

-47-  Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect, or any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties herein or affect the satisfaction or non-

Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
Parent.



5.10  _Employees_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall ensure that employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who
remain in the employment of Parent or its Affiliates after the Effective Time
(the "Continuing Employees") shall receive compensation and employee benefits
that in the aggregate for each such employee are no less favorable than those
provided to a similarly situated employee of Parent or its Affiliates who is
not a Continuing Employee taking into account the employees performance and
geographic location.



(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other Affiliates to
recognize the service of each employee with the Company or its Affiliates
before the Effective Time as if such service had been performed with Parent or
its Affiliates for all purposes under the vacation and severance plans
maintained by Parent or its Affiliates after the Effective Time and for the
purposes of eligibility and vesting under all other employee benefit plans,
programs and agreements maintained by Parent or its Affiliates after the
Effective Time (in each case, to the extent such plans, programs, or
agreements are made available to the Companys employees).



(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates in
which employees of the Company are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its other Affiliates, to the extent permitted by the relevant welfare plan, to
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did
not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Company
or its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each such
employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be assumed and converted into an option to purchase Parent
Common Stock. Each Company Option so assumed and converted shall have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the
terms and conditions set forth in the Company Option Plans and the applicable
stock option agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time with respect to the corresponding Company Option, except that (i) such
assumed and converted option shall be exercisable for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock) of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Option Exchange Ratio, (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock  



 

-48-  issuable upon exercise of such assumed and converted option shall be equal
to the quotient (rounded up to the next whole cent) obtained by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio and (iii) Parents Board of Directors or a committee thereof
shall succeed to the authority of the Companys Board of Directors or any
committee thereof with respect to the Company Options and Company Option
Plans. As promptly as practicable following the Closing, Parent shall issue to
each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an
outstanding Company Option under the Company Option Plans a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption and conversion of such Company Option.



(b) Within a reasonable period of time after the last Business Day of each
month after the date of this Agreement and on or about the date which is five
Business Days prior to the expected date on which the Closing will occur, the
Company shall provide such information as Parent may reasonably request to
determine whether any payments or benefits made or provided, or to be made or
provided, will constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code in respect of the Merger.



(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP in order to shorten each purchase and/or offering period under
such plan which extends beyond the Effective Time (the "Current Offerings")
such that a new purchase date for each such Current Offering shall occur
prior to the Effective Time and shares shall be purchased by Company ESPP
participants prior to the Effective Time. The Company ESPP shall terminate
immediately prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective Time, or (ii) the date
upon which the Company ESPP terminates by its terms. Subsequent to the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall take no action pursuant to the terms of the
ESPP to commence any new purchase and/or offering periods other than such
periods of one-month duration consistent with past practice.



(d) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) covering the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing.



(e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all unissued shares of Company
Common Stock then reserved for issuance (the "Assumed Shares") under the
Companys 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Specified Target Plan"). For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not assume, and the Assumed Shares shall
not be subject to the terms and conditions of, the Specified Target Plan. The
Assumed Shares shall thereafter be reserved for issuance under an acquisition
equity incentive plan of Parent (the "Parent Acquisition Equity Incentive
Plan"), which Parent will implement in connection with the Merger. The Assumed
Shares reserved for issuance shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
the Parent Acquisition Equity Incentive Plan.



(f) The Company shall amend the 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan of the Company
to provide that any Company Options granted by the Company under such plan
after the date of this Agreement shall not have any accelerated vesting upon
any event contemplated by this Agreement, whether alone or together with any
other event (including upon consummation of the Merger, or in connection with
any termination of employment upon or within any specified time period
following the Merger).



5.12 _Spreadsheet_. The Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare
and deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing, a spreadsheet in a form to
be supplied by Parent to the Company, which spreadsheet shall be dated as of
the Closing Date and shall set forth, as of the Closing Date and immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (i) the names of all holders of Company Options
and their respective addresses and where available, taxpayer identification
numbers, (ii) the number of shares  



 

-49-  of Company Common Stock subject to Company Options held by such Persons,
(iii) the exercise price per share in effect for each Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iv) the vesting status and
schedule with respect to each Company Option held by each holder thereof, (v)
the Tax status of each Company Option under Section 422 of the Code, and (vi)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Company Options to be assumed by Parent and the per share exercise price
thereof.



5.13 _Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will assume, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and
its directors and officers as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified
Parties") and any indemnification provisions under the Companys Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in each
case, subject to applicable Legal Requirements. From and after the Effective
Time, such obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such modification is
required by law.



(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Merger becomes effective, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts
and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to
the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement in the
form delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement
(the "Existing DandO Policy"), to the extent that directors and officers
liability insurance coverage is commercially available; _provided, however
__,_ that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO
Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage, including a "tail"
insurance policy; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute or
"tail" policies) in excess of $6,800,000 (the "Maximum Premium"). In the event
any future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute
policies) exceed the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any
substitute or "tail" policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained
for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium.



(c) This Section 5.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and may not be amended, altered or repealed after the
Effective Time without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified
Party (provided that any amendment, alteration or repeal prior the Effective
Time shall be governed by Section 7.4). 



5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Provided that the Company delivers to Parent the
Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable law) to cause any disposition of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or
acquisition of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by Article I of this Agreement by each Company Insider to be exempt  



 

-50-  under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. "Section 16
Information" shall mean information regarding the Company Insiders,
the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Company
Insider and expected to be exchanged for cash in connection with the Merger,
and the number and description of the Company Options held by each such
Company Insider and expected to be converted into options to purchase Parent
Common Stock, in connection with the Merger. "Company Insiders" shall mean
those individuals who are subject to the reporting requirement of Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.



5.15 _Rights Agreement_. The Company Board shall render the Rights (as
defined in the Rights Agreement) inapplicable to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that a "Stock
Acquisition Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) occurs, the Company
shall provide written notice to Parent thereof within one Business Day of the
occurrence of such event and shall redeem all of the Rights within one
Business Day of receipt of a written request from Parent that the Company
effect such redemption. Except as approved in writing by Parent, the Company
Board shall not (i) amend the Rights Agreement, (ii) redeem the Rights, or
(iii) take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the
Rights Agreement that would interfere with Parent consummating the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.



5.16 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all
actions possible to ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) if any takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transactions
contemplated hereby, use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.



5.17 _Certificates._ The Company shall (i) prior to the Closing Date deliver
FIRPTA documentation, including a notice to the Internal Revenue Service, in
accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2)
and as required under Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(1), in the form
reasonably requested by Parent, dated as of the Closing Date and executed by
the Company, together with written authorization for Parent to deliver such
notice form to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Company after the
Effective Time, and a FIRPTA notification letter, in the form reasonably
requested by Parent and as required under Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2(h)(1), dated as of the Closing Date and executed by the Company; and
(ii) a certificate dated within three Business Days of the Closing from the
Secretary of State of the jurisdiction of organization of the Company and
each of the Scheduled Subsidiaries certifying that such entity is in good
standing in such jurisdiction.



5.18 _Director and Officer Resignations_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a written letter of resignation from each of the
directors of the Company and from each of the directors and officers of each
of its Subsidiaries that will be effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) of Parent;



(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before May 30, 2006 or any other date that Parent and the Company may
agree upon in writing (the "Initial End Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Initial End Date, but on such

October 31, 2006 (the "Extended End Date");  _provided_ , _further_ , in any
event, a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(b) if the failure to consummate the Merger by the Initial End
Date or the Extended End Date, as the case may be, is principally caused by
the breach by such party of this Agreement;



(c) by either Parent or the Company, if a Governmental Entity shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action
is final and nonappealable;



(d) by either Parent or the Company, if the Company Shareholder Approval shall
not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote
at a meeting of Company shareholders duly convened therefor or at any
adjournment thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to the Company
where the  



 

-54-  failure to obtain such Company Shareholder Approval is caused by any action
or failure to act of the Company that constitutes a breach of this
Agreement; 



(e) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case
such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue; _provided_ that if such inaccuracy in

would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue; _provided_ that if such
inaccuracy in the Companys representations and warranties or breach by the
Company, is curable within 30 days by the Company, then Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) for 30 days after delivery
of written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach (it being
understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
paragraph (f) if such breach by the Company is cured during such 30-day
period) or (ii) if a Material Adverse Effect on the Company shall have
occurred;



(g) by Parent (at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval) if a Triggering Event (as defined below) shall have occurred; or



(h) by the Company, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if
the Company Board authorizes the Company, following material compliance with
all provisions and requirements of Sections 5.2, Section 5.3 and this Section
7.1(h) of this Agreement, to accept (or to enter into a written agreement for
a transaction constituting) a Superior Offer; _provided_ that the Company
shall have paid all amounts due pursuant to Section 7.3(b) of this Agreement
in accordance with the terms specified therein; and _provided_ _further_ that
(x) the Company notifies Parent, in writing and at least four Business Days
prior to such termination, of its intent to terminate this Agreement to accept
(or to enter into a written agreement for a transaction constituting) a
Superior Offer, attaching a final and complete version of a definitive
agreement providing for such Superior Offer executed on behalf of the Person
making such Superior Offer and all exhibits and other attachments thereto
(the "Third Party Agreement"), subject only to acceptance by the Company by
countersignature of such Third Party Agreement on behalf of the Company and
subject to no additional conditions (other than the condition that
this Agreement be terminated), and (y) Parent does not make, prior to the
expiration of such four Business Day period, a counteroffer that the Company
Board concludes in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its
financial advisor, is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the
Company as such Superior Offer, it being understood that the Company shall not
enter into the Third Party Agreement during such four Business Day period.



For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Triggering Event" shall be deemed to

Company Shareholder Approval; (ii) the Company shall have failed to include in
the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board to the Companys
shareholders in favor of the Company Shareholder Approval; (iii) the Company

disclosing that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange
offer.



7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company or
their respective officers, directors, shareholders or affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the provisions of Section 5.5(a) (Confidentiality), this
Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 7.3 (Expenses and Termination
Fees) and Article VIII (General Provisions) shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein

agreements contained in this Agreement.



7.3 _Expenses and Termination Fees_.

Proposal with respect to the Company was publicly disclosed and not publicly
withdrawn, and (C) within 12 months following the termination of this
Agreement, either an Acquisition (as defined in Section 7.3(d)) with respect
to the Company is consummated or the Company enters into a Contract providing
for an Acquisition, then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent a
fee equal to $170,000,000 in immediately available funds promptly but in no
event later than: one Business Day after the date of such termination,
if terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(g); prior to or concurrently with such
termination if terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(h); or the earlier of the
date of the Companys entry into such Contract providing for an Acquisition or
the consummation of such Acquisition, if terminated pursuant to clause (iii)
above.



(c) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreement contained in Section
7.3(b) is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the amount of, and the basis for payment of, the fee described
therein is reasonable and appropriate in all respects, and (iii) without this
agreement, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner the fee due pursuant to Section
7.3(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that
results in a judgment for the amounts set forth in Section 7.3(b),
the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount set forth in Section 7.3(b) at the prime
rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made hereunder. Payment of the fee described in Section 7.3(b) shall not

the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company immediately
preceding such  



 

-56-  transaction hold less than 40% of the aggregate equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any direct or indirect
parent thereto, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the Company or its
Subsidiaries of assets (in a transaction or series of transactions)
representing in excess of 40% of the aggregate fair market value of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such sale,
or (iii) the acquisition by any Person or Group (including by way of a tender
offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company), directly or
indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of the
then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.



7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after the Company Shareholders Approval
have been obtained; provided, after the Company Shareholders Approval have
been obtained, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with
the rules of the NYSE requires further approval by such shareholders without
such further shareholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Sub
and the Company.

 



7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, except that Parent may not extend for the benefit of Sub and vice
versa, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The agreement of Parent
to any extension or waiver shall be deemed to be the agreement of Sub to such
extension or waiver. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

8.3 _Interpretation_. 



(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made to a
Schedule, such reference shall be to a Schedule to the Company Disclosure
Letter. Where a reference is made to a law, such reference is to such law as
amended. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.



(b) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
phrases "provided to," "furnished to," and phrases of similar import when
used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall mean that a true,
correct and complete paper copy of the information or material referred to has
been delivered to the party to whom such information or material is to be
provided. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words
of any gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the singular or
plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; and
(iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and derivative or similar
words refer to this entire Agreement.



 

-58- (c) In this Agreement, "knowledge" means, with respect to the Company, the
knowledge of a fact, circumstance, event or other matter by the senior
executive officers of the Company listed on Schedule 8.3(c) hereto and the
directors of the Company, after reasonable inquiry and review, including
reasonable inquiry of the persons employed by the Company charged with
administrative or operational responsibility for such matters for the Company.



(d) The one percent (1%) threshold established by the parties with respect to
the Companys capitalization in Section 6.3(a) hereof shall not, in and of
itself, constitute an economic benchmark for determining whether any Effect
shall be deemed to be material in relation to the Company and its business or
shall be deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.



8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being
understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart.



8.5 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein
or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, and
the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its
terms, and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as
conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 5.13.



8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that Parent may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent without the prior consent of the Company;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall remain liable for all of its obligations under
this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.



8.7  _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.



 

8.8 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto
shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court  



 

-59-  of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to such
states principles of conflicts of law; _provided_ , _however_ , that issues
involving the consummation and effects of the Merger shall be governed by
Georgia Law. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Federal courts of the United States of America located
within the County of New York in the State of New York solely in respect of
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not
to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims
with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in
such a New York Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject
matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
Section 8.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law,
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. With respect to any particular
action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie solely in the County of New York,
New York.

counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement

shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
