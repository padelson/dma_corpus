Such wire transfer shall be sent by

Purchaser to the Escrow Agent for the account of Sellers no later than 3:00
PM, San Antonio, Texas time on the Closing Date.

Sellers and Purchaser agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation, (ii) act in accordance with the Allocation in the preparation of financial statements and filing of all tax returns and in the course of any tax audit, tax review or tax litigation relating thereto, and (iii) refrain from, and cause their Affiliates to refrain from, taking a position inconsistent with the Allocation for all tax purposes. If, as of the Closing Sellers and Purchaser have not been able to agree on the Allocation, then Sellers and Purchaser shall have the right to allocate the Purchase Price in a manner as reasonably determined by each of them independently. 

  

 2.3 _Initial Deposit; Additional Deposit_. No later than the Effective Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Escrow Agent (i) a wire transfer or check in the sum of One Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,000.00) payable to the order of Sellers representing the independent consideration for Sellers execution of this Agreement and agreement to provide Purchaser with the Study Period (which check or the proceeds of which wire transfer shall thereafter be delivered by Escrow Agent to Sellers and shall not be a part of the Deposit or be applicable to the Purchase Price) and (ii) a wire transfer or cashiers or certified check in the amount of the Initial Deposit. The Initial Deposit, the Additional Deposit, when and if made, and all interest earned thereon are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Deposit".

In the event that Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Study Period, then prior to the expiration of the Study Period, time being of the essence, Purchaser shall deliver to Escrow Agent a wire transfer or cashiers or certified check in the sum of Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) (the " _Additional Deposit_ ").

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Purchasers Environmental Consultants reasonably recommends obtaining an additional study or investigation of any Environmental Condition, the Study Period shall be extended for up to two (2) weeks to afford Purchaser additional time to complete such investigations. If such tests, studies and investigations warrant, in Purchasers sole, absolute and unreviewable discretion, the purchase of the Property for the purposes contemplated by Purchaser, then Purchaser shall proceed with this transaction in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, if, prior to the expiration of the Study Period, Purchaser shall have determined that the Property is unacceptable to Purchaser and Purchaser shall have provided written notice to Sellers and Escrow Agent that it has determined in its sole, absolute and unreviewable discretion, to terminate this Agreement (for any or no reason), this Agreement automatically shall terminate, the Initial Deposit shall be paid to Sellers (except if such termination is as a result of a Material Environmental Condition or Material Structural Defect(s)) and Purchaser and Sellers shall be released from all further liability or obligation hereunder except those which expressly survive a termination of this Agreement. If during the Study Period Purchaser determines that there exists on the Property a Material Environmental Condition, Purchaser shall provide Sellers with reasonable evidence of such condition, whereupon Purchaser may (x) if such condition affects one, but not both of the Undeveloped Tracts, terminate this Agreement with respect to the affected tract in which event such tract shall be excluded from this Agreement for all purposes, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount set forth opposite such affected tract on _Schedule 2.4(a)_ attached hereto and this Agreement shall otherwise continue unmodified or (y) if such condition affects both Undeveloped Tracts or the Hotel, then Purchaser may terminate this Agreement, in either case by delivering written notice to Sellers prior to expiration of the Study Period. If during the Study Period Purchaser determines that Material Structural Defect(s) exist, Purchaser shall provide Sellers with reasonable written evidence of the costs to remedy such defect(s) as estimated by Purchasers Structural Consultants (the "Repair Estimate"), then Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to Sellers prior to expiration of the Study Period. Sellers shall have the right to dispute the Repair Estimate (a "Repairs Costs Dispute"), then Sellers shall have the right to notify Purchaser in writing of the same (a "Repairs Costs Dispute Notice") 

   ##### 

  

 

within ten (10) business days after Sellers receipt of the Repair Estimate,
in which event the termination of this Agreement shall be deferred and
Sellers and Purchaser shall thereafter proceed to diligently and in good
faith attempt to resolve such dispute and, if the parties are unable to
resolve the same within seven (7) business days after Purchasers receipt of
the applicable Repairs Costs Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be submitted
for resolution by binding arbitration in accordance with the terms,
conditions and provisions of _Exhibit L-1_ attached to this Agreement;
provided, however, instead of using architects as the arbitrator, three
(3) neutral general contractors shall be appointed in the same manner as set
forth on _Exhibit L-1_. If the agreed amount of the Repairs Estimate is less
than $5,000,000.00 such termination notice shall be deemed null and void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such partial or full termination resulting
from any Material Environmental Condition or Material Structural
Defect(s) shall be ineffective if within five (5) days following the giving
of such notice of termination Purchaser and Sellers agree on the terms of a
Purchase Price reduction acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers in connection
with such Material Environmental Condition and/or Material
Structural Defect(s). If Purchaser terminates this Agreement during the Study
Period as the result of the discovery of a Material Environmental Condition
or Material Structural Defect(s) the entire Deposit shall be returned to
Purchaser and the parties shall have no further obligations hereunder
except those that survive termination hereof. If Purchaser does not provide
such written notice of termination prior to the expiration of the Study
Period and Purchaser timely deposits the Additional Deposit in accordance
with _Section 2.3_, Purchaser shall be deemed to have determined that the
Property is acceptable to Purchaser and the Initial Deposit and the
Additional Deposit shall become non-refundable except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement. The depositing of the Additional Deposit and the
expiration of the Study Period (and Purchasers right to terminate same)
shall be tolled until such time as the Parties have agreed upon, or
arbitration has resolved, the amount of the Material Structural Defect(s).
Purchaser Parties shall have no discussions, correspondence, or other contact
with any Hotel Employees, including, without limitation, any Executive
Employees unless approved by and coordinated in advance with Sellers. Sellers
agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause Manager to permit
Purchaser to have reasonable opportunities to discuss the Hotel and its
business and employment with the General Manager, Controller, Director of
Sales and Chief Engineer of the Hotel. 

   

 (b) Sellers have either made available for review and inspection in its offices or have delivered to Purchaser copies of the documents described on _Schedule 2.4(b)_ attached hereto to the extent in Sellers possession or control (collectively, the " _Submission Matters_ ").

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall have no obligation to deliver any materials to Purchaser to the extent their delivery is prohibited pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 If Sellers fail to make available any of the Submission Matters as provided above or fail to provide any of the items specified in _Section 2.4(e)_ below as provided therein, Purchaser shall give Sellers notice thereof so that Sellers shall have an opportunity to cure such failure by providing such items. Sellers shall use good faith efforts to deliver all Submission Matters in its possession or control to Purchaser.

The provisions of this _Section 2.4(c)_ shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Purchaser understands and agrees that any on-site inspections of the Property shall occur at reasonable times agreed upon by Sellers and Purchaser after reasonable prior written notice to Sellers and shall be conducted so as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the Property and the use of the Property by the tenants and the guests of the Hotel. Manager and/or Sellers shall have the right to have a representative present during any such inspections. If Purchaser desires to do any invasive testing at the Property, Purchaser shall do so only after notifying Sellers and obtaining Sellers prior written consent thereto (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser shall not permit any liens to attach to the Property by reason of such inspections. Purchaser shall (i) restore the Property, at its own expense, to substantially the same condition which existed prior to any inspection or other activities of Purchaser thereon; and (ii) be responsible for and pay any and all liens by contractors, subcontractors, materialmen, or laborers performing the inspections or any other work for Purchaser or Purchaser Affiliates engaged in Purchasers inspection activities on or related to the Property.

Other than (i) as specifically required in this Agreement, (ii) Monetary Title Encumbrances, which are required to be covered by a Monetary Encumbrance Release at Closing as provided above, and (iii) using commercially reasonable efforts to cure Non-Mandatory Monetary Title Encumbrances (provided that Sellers shall be obligated to expend up to $250,000.00 in the aggregate to cure such Non-Mandatory Monetary Title Encumbrances), Sellers shall not be obligated to incur any expenses or incur any liability to cure any Purchasers Objections. Sellers may notify Purchaser within five (5) days after receipt of notice of Purchasers Objections (" _Sellers  Response Period_") whether Sellers, in their sole discretion, agree to attempt to cure any of such Purchasers Objections (other than Sellers obligations with respect to the Monetary Title Encumbrances and certain Non-Mandatory Monetary Title Encumbrances as set forth above) (" _Sellers  Response_"). If Sellers agree in Sellers Response to attempt to cure any of such Purchasers Objections (that they are otherwise not obligated to cure as provided herein), Sellers shall use good faith efforts to cure (without any obligation to expend any money or incur any liability) such Purchasers Objections that Sellers have agreed to attempt to cure on or before the Closing Date to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser.

expenses relating to such consents. Sellers may cancel any Operating
Agreement, Occupancy Agreement, Leased Property Agreement, or Off-
Site Facility Agreement at any time prior to the Closing with the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall be subject to the Approval
Standard so long as the termination would not have an adverse affect on the

facts within ninety (90) days following Closing. Sellers, at no cost or
expense to Purchaser (except as provided in _Section 7.5_ ) shall terminate,

 6.6 _Termination of Hotel Employees; WARN Act_ On the Management Termination Date, the employment at the Hotel of all Hotel Employees shall be terminated.

 Sellers shall receive a credit for any prepaid expenses for which Purchaser is assuming the underlying obligation accruing to periods on or after the Closing Date and utility and other deposits relating to the Property that are assigned to Purchaser. Purchaser shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price for the total of (i) prepaid rents, (ii) prepaid room receipts and deposits, function receipts and deposits and other reservation receipts and deposits, and (iii) unforfeited security deposits together with any interest payable to a tenant thereon held by Sellers under Occupancy Agreements. At Closing, Sellers shall sell to Purchaser in connection with the Hotel, and Purchaser shall purchase from Sellers, at face value, in addition to the Purchase Price: (i) all petty cash funds in connection with the Hotel guest operations at the Property; and (ii) the so-called "guest ledger" as mutually approved by Purchaser and Sellers for the Hotel of guest accounts receivable payable to the Hotel as of the check out time for the Hotel on the Closing Date (based on guests and customers then using the Hotel) both (1) in occupancy from the preceding night through check out time the morning of the Closing Date, and (2) previously in occupancy prior to check out time on the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, transfer or sale at face value shall have the following meanings: (i) for petty cash, an amount equal to the total of all petty cash funds on hand and transferred to Purchaser; and (ii) for the guest ledger, the total of all credit card accounts receivable as shown on the records of the Hotel, less actual collection costs (i.e., fees retained by credit card companies), less accounting charges for rooms furnished on a gratuity or complimentary basis to any hotel staff or 

   ##### 

  

 

as an accommodation to other parties and less Purchasers one-half (1/2) share
of the Rooms Ledger for the date of Closing per _Section 7.6(h)_. The
purchase price of said petty cash fund and guest ledger shall be paid to
Sellers at Closing by a credit to Sellers in the computation of
the adjustments and prorations on the Closing Date. Other than petty cash,
there shall be no transfer of working capital or other funds held by Sellers
or Manager at Closing. 

   

 Sellers or Manager on behalf of Sellers shall be required to pay or cause to be paid all retail sales (as distinguished from any tax on the sale of any personal property effected pursuant to this Agreement), occupancy and liquor taxes and like impositions up to and accruing prior to the Closing Date but not including the date of Closing. Any such taxes applicable to the Rooms Ledger shall be apportioned equally between Sellers and Purchaser. 

  

 If accurate allocations cannot be made at Closing because current bills are not obtainable (as, for example, in the case of utility bills and/or real estate or personal property taxes), the parties shall allocate such revenue or expenses at Closing on the best available information, subject to adjustment upon receipt of the final bill or other evidence of the applicable revenue or expense. The obligation to make the adjustment shall survive the closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement for a period of ninety (90) days unless the final bill or other evidence of the applicable revenue or expense is not available within ninety (90) days, in which case such obligations to adjust shall survive for such period of time for the parties to receive such bill or other evidence and make payment to each other based on the same. Any revenue received or expense incurred by Sellers or by Purchaser with respect to the Property after the date of Closing shall be promptly allocated in the manner described herein and the parties shall promptly pay or reimburse any amount due. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to agree on any prorated items required to be contained in the closing statement on the Closing Date, the Closing shall occur and a preliminary closing statement shall be signed with respect to such amounts and issues that are agreed upon by Sellers and Purchaser. With respect to any closing statement amounts or issues that are not agreed upon at Closing, such disputed sums shall be placed into escrow with Escrow Agent and Sellers and Purchaser shall thereafter work in good faith to resolve, allocate or prorate such amounts or issues on a cash basis; provided that if such amounts or issues are not fully agreed upon and paid within ten (10) business days after the Closing, then, in such event, such amounts or issues shall be submitted to Deloitte and Touche or another independent certified public accountant with a hospitality practice reasonably acceptable to Sellers and Purchaser, for final resolution, and Sellers and Purchaser agree to be bound by the determination of such accountant. The costs and expenses incurred in connection with the services of such accountant shall be borne and paid equally by Purchaser and Sellers. Sellers or their representatives shall have the right to institute tax reduction or other proceedings to reduce the assessed valuation of the Property with respect to the period ending at the end of the fiscal year prior to the year in which the Closing occurs provided that Sellers shall not enter into any settlement that would bind the Property to having a higher assessed value after the Closing than would have been the case had such settlement not occurred. If Purchaser, at any time following the Closing, institutes tax reduction or other proceedings to reduce the assessed valuation of the Property with respect to the period ending at the end of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, then Purchaser agrees to coordinate such proceedings with Sellers and seek Sellers input so as to maximize the benefits to both Sellers and Purchaser pursuant thereto. If any refund of any real property tax, water rates and charges, sewer taxes and rents or similar items is issued after the Closing Date for any period that includes the period prior to the Closing Date, then such 

   ##### 

  

 

refund shall be applied as follows: first, to the cost incurred in obtaining
such refund, second, to any amount required to be refunded to any tenants
under any Occupancy Agreements in accordance with the terms of such Occupancy
Agreements, to the extent applicable, and third, the balance of such refund,
if any, shall be apportioned between Sellers and Purchaser as of the Closing
Date. The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ shall survive the Closing for a
period of ninety (90) days, or such longer period as is reasonably necessary
for the parties to comply with the obligations set forth in this _Section
7.6_ (e.g., reproration of taxes upon receipt of final tax bill). 

   

 7.7 _Safe Deposit Boxes_. On the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause Manager to make available to Purchaser at the Hotel all receipts and agreements in Managers possession relating to all safe deposit boxes in use at the Hotel, other than safes or lockboxes, if any, located inside individual guest rooms in the Hotel. From and after the Closing, Sellers and Manager shall be relieved of any and all responsibility in connection with each said box, and Purchaser shall indemnify Sellers, Manager and any Affiliate thereof and hold them harmless from and against any claim, liability, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by them with respect thereto. Sellers shall hold Purchaser harmless from any other liability, claim, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys fees) with respect to such safety deposit box arising out of acts, omissions or occurrences occurring prior to the Closing Date. The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ shall survive the Closing. 

  

 7.8 _Inventory of Baggage_. The representatives of Sellers and/or Manager, and of Purchaser shall prepare an inventory of baggage at the Hotel as of 12:00 noon on the Closing Date (which inventory of baggage shall be binding on all parties thereto) of (i) all luggage, valises and trunks checked or left in the care of the Hotel by guests then or formerly in the Hotel, (ii) parcels, laundry, valet packages and other property of guests checked or left in the care of the Hotel by guests then or formerly in the Hotel (excluding, however, property in Hotel safe deposit boxes), (iii) all luggage or other property of guests retained by Sellers or Manager as security for any unpaid accounts receivable, and (iv) all items contained in the Hotel lost and found. Purchaser shall be responsible from and after the Closing Date for all baggage and other items listed in such inventory of baggage, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Sellers and any Affiliate thereof harmless from and against any claim, liability, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by them with respect thereto. Sellers hereby agrees to hold Purchaser harmless from any other liability or claims with respect to such inventory of baggage arising out of acts, omissions or occurrences occurring prior to the Closing Date. The provisions of this _Section 7.8_ shall survive the Closing. 

  

 7.9 _Acquisition and Payment for Inventory_. Sellers agree to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Sellers, at cost, all unopened food and beverage and all retail merchandise held for sale on the Hotel and the Golf Course, for a price equal to the cost of such Inventory. The cost of such Inventory is not included in the Purchase Price. In connection with Closing, Purchaser and Sellers shall conduct an inspection of such Inventory to verify the amount of such Inventory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Manager shall have the right pursuant to the Management Agreement to acquire from Sellers all Inventory bearing the identification of Westin. In no event shall Purchaser be required to purchase Inventory bearing the identification of Westin and/or Inventory not being conveyed to Purchaser pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.10 _Assumption_. At Closing, Purchaser shall assume all (i) obligations that Purchaser expressly assumes under this Agreement and/or the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, (ii) Advance Bookings, (iii) liabilities for which Purchaser receives a credit to the Purchase Price on the closing statement or pursuant to any post-closing adjustments, and (iv) obligations under Permitted Title Exceptions that accrue to the period from and after the Closing Date, or that accrue to the period prior to the Closing Date and for which Purchaser receives a credit to the Purchase Price on the closing statement or pursuant to any post-closing adjustments. Except for the foregoing assumed liabilities and expenses prorated pursuant to Section 7.6 hereof and any liabilities and expenses caused by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser acting on behalf of Purchaser in connection with Purchasers inspection activity for which Purchaser shall be liable, Sellers shall not be released from liability to any unrelated third party, other than Purchaser, as provided in  _Section 3.28_, accruing prior to the Closing Date with respect to the ownership, use and operation of the Property, including the Hotel including any pre-Closing tax liabilities. The provisions of this _Section 7.10_ shall survive the Closing. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
  _GENERAL PROVISIONS_  

   

 8.1 _Fire or Other Casualty_. Sellers agree to give Purchaser prompt notice of any fire or other casualty to the Property that occurs between the Effective Date and the Closing Date and which costs more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to repair. If, prior to Closing, the Property is damaged by fire or other casualty and (i) less than fifteen percent (15%) of the Hotel Improvements (including the Improvements and the grass located on the golf courses included in the Property) are damaged or destroyed, and (ii) the damage would cost not more than two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price to repair (including the lost profit of the business for the estimated repair period), then neither party shall have the right to terminate its obligations under this Agreement to purchase or sell the Property by reason thereof and the Closing shall take place without abatement of the Purchase Price; but, if the Property is insured, Sellers shall assign to Purchaser at the Closing all of Sellers interest in any insurance proceeds (except use and occupancy insurance, rent loss and business interruption insurance, and any similar insurance for the period preceding the Closing Date) that may be payable to Sellers on account of any such fire or other casualty or, if the Property is uninsured, then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser at Closing an amount equal to the cost of repairing the damage, to the extent such proceeds or sums have not been previously expended or are otherwise required to reimburse Sellers for actual expenditures of restoration, plus Sellers shall credit the amount of any deductibles under any policies related to such insurance proceeds against the Purchase Price. If any such damage due to fire or other casualty affects more than fifteen percent (15%) of the Improvements or would cost in excess of two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price to repair (including the lost profit of the business for the estimated repair period), either Purchaser or, if such loss is uninsured, excluding Sellers deductibles, in an amount in excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00), Sellers may terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice given to the other party within ten (10) days after Sellers have given Purchaser the notice of damage or casualty referred to in this  _Section 8.1_, or on the Closing Date, whichever is earlier, in which case the Additional Deposit, if paid, and one-half of the Initial Deposit shall be promptly returned to Purchaser, Sellers shall be paid one-half of the Initial Deposit (unless Sellers terminate this Agreement in connection with an uninsured casualty, in which event the entire Initial Deposit shall be refunded to Purchaser) and the parties hereto shall be released of all 

   ##### 

  

 

further obligations hereunder with respect to the Property except those which
expressly survive a termination of this Agreement. Should Purchaser and
Sellers elect to proceed to Closing notwithstanding the amount of the loss,
the Closing shall take place without abatement of the Purchase Price and at
Closing, Sellers shall assign to Purchaser all of Sellers interest in
any insurance proceeds to the extent the loss was insured (except use and
occupancy insurance, rent loss and business interruption insurance, and any
similar insurance for the period preceding the Closing Date) that may be
payable to Sellers on account of any such fire or other casualty to
the extent such proceeds or sums have not been previously expended or are
otherwise not required to reimburse Sellers for actual expenditures of
restoration plus Sellers shall credit the amount of any deductibles under any
policies related to such insurance proceeds against the Purchase
Price (except to the extent such sums have been previously expended on the
restoration), or, to the extent the loss was not insured, Sellers shall grant
to Purchaser a credit against the Purchase Price equal to the amount required
to complete such repairs or restoration. Sellers shall cooperate and use
their reasonable best efforts to cause insurers to pay claims as expeditiously
as possible. 

   

 8.2 _Condemnation_. After the Effective Date, Sellers agree to give Purchaser prompt notice of any notice it receives of any taking (or threat of taking) by condemnation of any part of or rights appurtenant to the Real Property. If such taking affects (or will affect) more than fifteen percent (15%) of the Land or will materially interfere with the operation or use of the Hotel which constitutes a part of such Real Property, Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Sellers within ten (10) days after Sellers have given Purchaser the notice of taking referred to in this _Section 8.2_, or on the Closing Date, whichever is earlier. For purposes of this  _Section 8.2_, a taking will materially interfere with the operation or use of the Hotel if it leaves remaining a balance of the Real Property in a condition that may not reasonably be anticipated to be economically operated for the purposes and in the manner in which the Real Property was operated prior to such taking comparable to the operations that are existing as of the Effective Date. If Purchaser exercises its option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.2_, the Additional Deposit and one-half of the Initial Deposit shall be promptly returned to Purchaser, Sellers shall be paid one-half of the Initial Deposit and the parties hereto shall be released from all further obligations hereunder with respect to the Property, except those which expressly survive a termination of this Agreement. If Purchaser does not so elect to terminate this Agreement, then the Closing shall take place as provided herein, and Sellers shall assign to Purchaser at the Closing all of Sellers interest in any condemnation award that may be payable to Sellers on account of any such condemnation and, at Closing, Sellers shall credit to the amount of the Purchase Price payable by Purchaser the amount, if any, of condemnation proceeds received by Sellers between the Effective Date and Closing less (i) any amounts reasonably expended by Sellers or Manager in collecting such sums, (ii) any amounts reasonably used by Sellers or Manager to repair the Property as a result of such condemnation, and (iii) any amounts that are reasonably allocated to lost earnings or other damages or losses (other than unrepaired property damages) reasonably allocated or attributed to the period of time prior to Closing. If, prior to the Closing, there shall occur a taking by condemnation of any part of or rights appurtenant to the Property that does not affect more than fifteen percent (15%) of the Land or does not materially interfere with the operation or use of the Hotel, Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement by reason thereof and the Closing shall take place without abatement of the Purchase Price, but Sellers shall assign to Purchaser at the Closing all of Sellers interest in any condemnation award which may be payable to Sellers on account of 

   ##### 

  

 

any such condemnation and, at Closing, Sellers shall credit to the amount of
the Purchase Price payable by Purchaser the amount, if any, of condemnation
proceeds received by Sellers between the Effective Date and Closing less (i)
any amounts reasonably expended by Sellers or Manager in collecting such
sums, (ii) any amounts reasonably used by Sellers or Manager to repair the
Property as a result of such condemnation, and (iii) any amounts which are
reasonably allocated to lost earnings or other damages or losses (other than
unrepaired property damages) reasonably allocated or attributed to the period
of time prior to Closing. Provided Purchaser has not exercised its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, Sellers shall
notify Purchaser in advance regarding any proceeding or negotiation with
respect to the condemnation and Purchaser shall have a reasonable right, at
its own cost and expense, to appear and participate in any such proceeding or
negotiation. For purposes of _Sections 8.1 and 8.2_ of this Agreement,
estimates of costs and time required for restoration or repair shall be made
by an architect or engineer, as appropriate, designated by Sellers and
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. 

   

 8.3 _Broker_. Purchaser warrants and represents to Sellers that Purchaser has not dealt with any real estate broker in connection with this transaction, nor has Purchaser been introduced to the Property or to Sellers by any real estate broker, and Purchaser shall indemnify Sellers and hold Sellers harmless from and against any claims, suits, demands or liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever arising on account of the claim of any other person, firm or corporation to a real estate brokerage commission or a finders fee as a result of having dealt with Purchaser, or as a result of having introduced Purchaser to Sellers or to the Property. In like manner, Sellers warrants and represents to Purchaser that, other than Jowell W. Thome ("Sellers Broker") Sellers have not dealt with any real estate broker in connection with this transaction, nor have Sellers been introduced to Purchaser by any other real estate broker, and Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser and save and hold Purchaser harmless from and against any claims, suits, demands or liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever arising on account of the claim of any person, firm or corporation to a real estate brokerage commission or a finders fee as a result of having dealt with Sellers in connection with this transaction, other than Sellers Broker. If this transaction closes, Sellers shall pay the commission owed to Sellers Broker in accordance with the terms of a separate written agreement with Sellers Broker. The provisions of this _Section 8.3_ shall survive the Closing and any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 8.4 _Tax Clearance Certificates_. Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge that they do not intend to obtain any sale and occupancy or similar tax clearance certificates shall be obtained in connection with the Closing, and Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser for any such taxes attributable to the period prior to Closing. The provisions of this _Section 8.4_ shall survive Closing. 

  

 8.5 _Confidentiality_. Except as hereinafter provided, Purchaser and Sellers and their Affiliates shall keep the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement and all documents or information disclosed to or made available to or discovered by each party in connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Submission Matters) confidential and such information shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating or effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, except as otherwise provided herein, neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall disclose unless and until the Closing occurs the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement or such other documents or information, except to persons who, in the reasonable 

   ##### 

  

 

business judgment of Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, "need to know" for
the purpose of evaluating or effecting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement such as without limitation, city officials involved in Purchasers
proposed development of the Property and any expansions thereof, and who are
instructed to keep such information confidential, such as their
respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, accountants, engineers,
surveyors, consultants, financiers, partners, investors, potential lessees
and bankers and such other third parties whose assistance is required in
connection with the consummation of this transaction and Purchasers proposed
expansion and development of the Property (collectively, " _Representatives_
"); provided, however, that information or documents shall not be subject to
the provisions of this  _Section 8.5_ if, not otherwise in violation of this
_Section 8.5_, such information or documents, (i) were or become(s)
generally available to the public, (ii) were or become(s) available to
Purchaser or its Affiliates or their Representatives on a non-confidential
basis from a source other than Sellers or their Affiliates or Manager, or
(iii) were or are developed by Purchaser or its Affiliates or their
Representatives without using or relying on any information or documents
otherwise covered by the provisions of this _Section 8.5_. As of the
Effective Date, the parties may either make a joint press release, or each
party may make an individual press release that is mutually and reasonably
agreed to by the other party; provided, that if the parties fail to agree on
the contents of a joint press release or separate press releases, each party
may nevertheless make its own individual press release, provided the other
party shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make, on the date of such
individual press release, its own individual press release, and copies of
each such individual press release shall be delivered to the other party
prior to being made. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is
acknowledged that Sellers and Purchaser are, or are Affiliates of,
respectively, regulated companies; consequently, each of Sellers and
Purchaser shall have the absolute and unbridled right to disclose any
information regarding the transaction contemplated by this Agreement required
by Applicable Laws or as determined to be necessary or appropriate by them or
their respective attorneys to satisfy disclosure and reporting obligations.
Furthermore, Sellers or Purchaser may disclose any information related to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement to a Person (the " _Acquisition
Target_ ") that Sellers or Purchaser or their respective Affiliate intends
to acquire or be acquired by via merger, takeover, or otherwise. The
dissemination of information shall, however, be contingent upon the execution
of a confidentiality agreement by and between Sellers or Purchaser (or their
respective Affiliates) and the Acquisition Target. The terms of this _Section
8.5_ shall supersede any prior confidentiality agreements executed by
Sellers, Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates, parents, or
subsidiaries, to the extent such confidentiality agreements relate or refer,
directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The provisions of this _Section 8.5_ relating to press releases shall not
survive the Closing and all the provisions of this _Section 8.5_
shall survive a termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years
after such termination; provided, however, that any liabilities or
obligations of either Sellers, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries that may have accrued or arisen under
any confidentiality agreements prior to the Effective Date shall survive such
confidentiality agreements being superceded hereby. 

   

 If either Sellers or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or any of their Representatives is required by any subpoena, interrogatories, request for production, or other legal process or by any Applicable Laws to disclose any confidential information, Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, will give the other party prompt written notice of the requirement and will cooperate with the other party so that the other party, at its expense, may seek an appropriate protective 

   ##### 

  

 

order. In the absence of a protective order, the party required to disclose,
including any Representatives, may disclose only such confidential
information as may be necessary to avoid any penalty, sanction, or other
material adverse consequence, and the party required to disclose will use
reasonable efforts to secure confidential treatment of any confidential
information so disclosed. 

   

 Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge that the breach of the provisions of this _Section 8.5_ by the other party or its respective Affiliates or Representatives may cause irreparable harm to the non-breaching party for which damages may not constitute an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties agree that any attempted, threatened, or actual breach of the provisions of this _Section 8.5_ by one party or its Affiliates or Representatives may be enjoined by an appropriate court order or judgment. The parties waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security as a condition to such court order or judgment. Injunctive relief will not be the sole remedy of the non-breaching party for a breach of the provisions of this _Section 8.5_ , and all legal and equitable remedies will continue to be available to the non-breaching party. If the non-breaching party is the prevailing party in any litigation relating to the breach of the provisions of this _Section 8.5_ by the other party or its Affiliates or Representatives, the non-breaching party will be entitled to recover (in addition to any damages or other relief granted) its reasonable legal fees and other expenses in connection with such litigation. 

  

 8.6 _Liquor Licenses_. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Manager, or its liquor subsidiary, to enter into an agreement with Purchaser, on customary and reasonable terms, which agreement shall allow Purchaser to "use" Managers (or its liquor subsidiarys) liquor license until such time as Purchaser obtains its liquor license (the "Short-Term License"). If Manager or its liquor subsidiary is unwilling to enter into such customary and reasonable agreement at Closing and Purchaser has been unable to obtain its own liquor license for the Property prior to Closing, Purchaser shall have the right to extend the Closing Date to the earliest of (x) three business days following the date Purchaser obtains such liquor license, (y) three business days following the date Purchaser obtains a Short-Term License from Manager or its Affiliate or (z) February 29, 2008. Such extension right must be exercised by Purchasers delivery of not less than seven (7) business days prior written notice to Sellers and the concurrent deposit with the Title Company of an additional deposit of $5,000,000.00 (the "Closing Extension Deposit"). The Closing Extension Deposit shall be applicable to the Purchase Price at Closing, but shall be non-refundable to Purchaser except in instances hereunder where the Additional Deposit is returned to Purchaser. 

  

 8.7 _Sellers  Accounts Receivable_. It is expressly agreed by and between Purchaser and Sellers that Sellers are hereby agreeing to sell or cause to be sold to Purchaser at Closing all of Sellers accounts receivable attributable to the period prior to Closing. Purchaser shall pay for such accounts receivable at ninety-seven percent (97%) of the value of such accounts receivable as shown on the Hotels books and records, it being expressly understood that such amount is not included in the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be obligated to purchase and Sellers shall retain those accounts receivables identified on _Schedule 8.7,_ and Purchaser agrees to promptly remit to Sellers any sums received with respect to such excluded accounts receivables. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.8 _Cooperation on Tax Matters._ Following the Closing, the parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other and shall make available to the other, as reasonably requested and at the expense of the requesting party, and to any taxing authority, all information, records or documents relating to tax liabilities or potential tax liabilities of Sellers for all periods on or prior to the Closing and any information which may be relevant to determining the amount payable under this Agreement, and shall preserve all such information, records and documents at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof. Sellers shall make available to Purchaser the records of individual wages of all employees, as well as copies of state unemployment tax returns, to the extent necessary for Purchaser to verify future unemployment tax rates and to calculate the correct taxable payroll for the remainder of the calendar year in which the transaction occurs. Sellers also shall file terminating Forms W-2 and Forms 1099 with respect to periods through and including the Closing Date, as appropriate. The provisions of this Section 8.8 will survive the Closing. 

  

 8.9 _SEC Filings._ In order to assist with any potential future Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filing requirements of Purchasers ultimate parent, Sellers shall, shall cause their Affiliates to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Manager and its Affiliates to, (i) provide such cooperation, and use reasonable best efforts to cause Sellers and Managers independent accountants with respect to the Property to cooperate, as Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with such filing requirements, (ii) make available the officers of Sellers and/or Sellers ultimate parent and (iii) cooperate with Purchaser in Purchasers efforts to cause such independent accountants to (x) deliver consents to the inclusion or incorporation by reference of any report in the SEC filings of Purchasers ultimate parent and (y) deliver "comfort-letters" in customary form in connection with any such SEC filing of Purchasers ultimate parent. Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers and/or Sellers ultimate parent for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other advisors fees and expenses) incurred by Sellers and/or Sellers ultimate parent in connection with performing their obligations under this Section 8.9. The provisions of this Section 8.9 will survive the Closing. 

  

ARTICLE IX 
  _DEFAULT; TERMINATION RIGHTS_  

   

 9.1 _Default by Sellers/Failure of Conditions Precedent_. If any condition set forth herein for the benefit of Purchaser cannot or will not be satisfied prior to Closing (unless the failure to satisfy such condition is caused by the default of Purchaser under this Agreement, or is otherwise within the reasonable control of a Purchaser Party or caused by an action of a Purchaser Party, in which event such condition shall be deemed waived), or if Seller defaults in the performance of any of its obligations and, if curable, if Sellers fail to cure any such matter or satisfy such condition within ten (10) business days after written notice thereof from Purchaser (or such other time period as may be explicitly provided for herein), (which ten (10) business day or other such time periods shall, if necessary, automatically extend the Closing Date to the expiration date of such ten (10) business day or other such time period), or upon the occurrence of any other event that would entitle Purchaser to terminate this Agreement and its obligations hereunder, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Purchaser, as its sole and exclusive 

   ##### 

  

 

remedy shall elect (a) to terminate this Agreement, in which event (i) the
Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit shall be promptly returned to
Purchaser and Purchaser shall retain its right to enforce the indemnities and
other provisions of this Agreement which expressly survive a termination of
this Agreement, (ii) all other rights and obligations of Sellers and
Purchaser hereunder (except those set forth herein which expressly survive a
termination of this Agreement) shall terminate immediately, and (iii) Seller
shall reimburse Purchaser for all of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, its due diligence of the
Property, and its preparation for the Closing, not to exceed $500,000.00; (b)
to waive such matter or condition and proceed to Closing with no reduction in
the Purchase Price; (c) to waive all other actions, rights, or claims for
damages for the failure to perform such obligations (other than costs and
expenses incurred in enforcing this Agreement and its right to enforce the
indemnities and other provisions of this Agreement which expressly survive
a termination of this Agreement or Closing), and to bring an equitable action
to enforce Sellers obligations pursuant to this Agreement by specific
performance; provided, (i) Purchaser shall provide written notice of
Purchasers intention to enforce this Agreement by specific performance and
Sellers shall not have cured such default or condition within fifteen (15)
days following delivery of such notice, and (ii) Purchasers suit for
specific performance shall be filed against Sellers in Bexar County, Texas,
in which the Property is located, on or before seventy-five (75) days
following the then scheduled Closing Date, failing which, Purchaser shall be
barred from enforcing this Agreement by specific performance and shall be
deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement as provided in clause (a)
above, or (d) extend Closing for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days to
afford Sellers additional time to satisfy such condition or cure such
default provided that if such condition is not satisfied or such default
cured within such thirty (30) day period then Purchasers sole remedies shall
be to elect to proceed under clause (a), (b) or (c) of this sentence as of
the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. If specific performance
of Sellers obligations hereunder is unavailable, Sellers, as Purchasers
sole and exclusive remedy, shall reimburse Purchaser for all of its out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement, its due diligence of the Property, and its preparation for
the Closing, not to exceed $500,000.00. 

   

 9.2 _Default by Purchaser/Failure of Conditions Precedent_. If any condition set forth herein for the benefit of Sellers (other than a default by Purchaser) cannot or will not be satisfied prior to Closing (unless the failure to satisfy such condition is caused by the default of Sellers under this Agreement, or is otherwise within the reasonable control of Sellers, in which event such condition shall be deemed waived), and if Purchaser fails to satisfy that condition within ten (10) business days after written notice thereof from Sellers (or such other time period as may be explicitly provided for herein), (which ten (10) business day or other such time periods shall, if necessary, automatically extend the Closing Date to the expiration date of such ten (10) business day or other such time period), Sellers, as their sole and exclusive remedy, shall elect either (a) to terminate this Agreement in which event the Additional Deposit shall be promptly returned to Purchaser and the parties hereto shall be released from all further obligations hereunder except those which expressly survive a termination of this Agreement, or (b) to waive such condition and its right to terminate, and instead, to proceed to Closing. If Purchaser defaults in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement, and Purchaser fails to cure any such default within the earlier of (i) the Closing, or (ii) ten (10) business days after notice thereof from Sellers, then Sellers sole remedy for such default shall be to terminate this Agreement and receive the Deposit and to retain its right to enforce the indemnities and other 

   ##### 

  

 

provisions of this Agreement which expressly survive a termination of this
Agreement; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be entitled to any
notice and right to cure in the event it wrongfully fails to proceed to
Closing as required by this Agreement. Sellers and Purchaser agree that, in
the event of such a default, the damages that Sellers would sustain as a
result thereof would be difficult if not impossible to ascertain. Therefore,
Sellers and Purchaser agree that, Sellers shall receive the Deposit and
retain the right to enforce the indemnities and other provisions of this
Agreement which expressly survive a termination of this Agreement, as full
and complete liquidated damages and as Sellers sole and exclusive remedy.
The provisions of this  _Section 9.2_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. 

   

 9.3 _Costs and Attorneys  Fees_. In the event of any litigation or dispute between the parties arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement, resulting in any litigation, then the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover its costs of prosecuting and/or defending same, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees at trial and all appellate levels. The provisions of this _Section 9.3_ shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 9.4 _Limitation of Liability_. The liability of each party hereto resulting from the breach or default by such party shall be limited to direct actual damages incurred by the injured party and each party hereto hereby waives its rights to recover from the other party punitive, exemplary, and speculative damages. The provisions of this _Section 9.4_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 9.4_ shall not limit or affect the rights of Sellers to receive the Deposit as liquidated damages as and when provided in this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE X 
  _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_  

   

 10.1 _Completeness; Termination of Access Agreement; Modification_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersedes all prior discussions, understandings, agreements and negotiations between the parties hereto. This Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument duly executed by the parties hereto. Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of the parties under and pursuant to the Management Agreement. 

  

 10.2 _Assignments_. Other than to an Affiliate of Purchaser, Purchaser may not assign its rights hereunder without the prior consent of Sellers; however, any such assignment (including one to Purchasers Affiliate) shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement prior to the Closing. To be effective hereunder, any assignment by Purchaser hereunder, even one to an Affiliate of Purchaser, must be accompanied by a fully executed and effective assignment and assumption agreement provided to Sellers no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, provided that such executed agreement may provide that it is effective as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have the right to designate any Affiliate as its nominee to receive title to the Property or such portion or portions 

   ##### 

  

 

thereof. Purchaser shall provide Seller the names of such Affiliate nominees,
if any no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall
have the right to assign their rights hereunder without the prior consent of
Purchaser; however, any such assignment (including one to Sellers
Affiliates) shall not relieve Sellers of their obligations hereunder. To be
effective hereunder, any assignment by Sellers hereunder, even one to an
Affiliate of Sellers, must be accompanied by a fully executed and effective
assignment and assumption agreement provided to Purchaser no later than five
(5) days prior to the Closing Date, provided that such executed agreement may
provide that it is effective as of the Closing Date. 

   

 10.3 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted respective successors and assigns. 

  

 10.4 _Days_. If any action is required to be performed, or if any notice, consent or other communication is given, on a day that is a Saturday or Sunday or a legal holiday in the jurisdiction in which the action is required to be performed or in which is located the intended recipient of such notice, consent or other communication, such performance shall be deemed to be required, and such notice, consent or other communication shall be deemed to be given, on the first business day following such Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Unless otherwise specified herein, all references herein to a "day" or "days" shall refer to calendar days and not business days. 

  

 10.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all documents referred to herein shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state in which the Property is located without regard to its principles of conflicts of law. 

  

 10.6 _Counterparts_. To facilitate execution, this Agreement may be executed in as many counterparts as may be required. It shall not be necessary that the signature on behalf of both parties hereto appear on each counterpart hereof. All counterparts hereof shall collectively constitute a single agreement. Telecopied signatures shall have the same valid and binding effect as original signatures. 

  

 10.7 _Severability_. If any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such term, covenant or condition to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and each term, covenant or condition of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

  

 10.8 _Costs_. Regardless of whether Closing occurs hereunder, and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each party hereto shall be responsible for its own costs in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, fees of attorneys, engineers and accountants. 

  

 10.9 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand, transmitted by facsimile transmission, sent prepaid for next-day delivery by Federal Express (or a comparable overnight delivery service) or sent by the United States mail, certified, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, at the 

   ##### 

  

 

addresses and with such copies as designated below. Any notice, request,
demand or other communication delivered or sent in the manner aforesaid may
be given by the party required to give such notice, etc., or its attorney,
and shall be deemed given or made (as the case may be) when actually
delivered to or refused by the intended recipient.

or to such other address as the intended recipient may have specified in a
notice to the other party. Any party hereto may change its address or
designate different or other persons or entities to receive copies by
notifying the other party and Escrow Agent in a manner described in
this Section. 

   

 10.10 _Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent referred to in the definition thereof contained in _Section 1.1_ hereof has agreed to act as such for the convenience of the parties without fee or other charges for such services as Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be liable: (a) to any of the parties for any act or omission to act except for its own negligence or willful misconduct; (b) for any legal effect, insufficiency, or undesirability of any instrument deposited with or delivered by Escrow Agent or exchanged by the parties hereunder, whether or not Escrow Agent prepared such instrument; (c) for any loss or impairment of funds that have been deposited in escrow while those funds are in the course of collection, or while those funds are on deposit in a financial institution, if such loss or impairment results from the failure, insolvency or suspension 

   ##### 

  

 

of a financial institution; (d) for the expiration of any time limit or other
consequence of delay, unless a properly executed written instruction,
accepted by Escrow Agent, has instructed Escrow Agent to comply with said
time limit; (e) for the default, error, action or omission of either other
party to the escrow. Escrow Agent, in its capacity as escrow agent, shall be
entitled to rely on any document or paper received by it, believed by such
Escrow Agent, in good faith, to be bona fide and genuine. In the event of any
dispute as to the disposition of the Initial Deposit or the Additional
Deposit or any other monies held in escrow, or of any documents held in
escrow, Escrow Agent may, if such Escrow Agent so elects, interplead the
matter by filing an interpleader action in a court of competent jurisdiction
in the county or circuit where the Real Property is located (to the
jurisdiction of which all parties do hereby consent), and pay into the
registry of the court the Initial Deposit or the Additional Deposit, or
deposit any such documents with respect to which there is a dispute in the
registry of such court, whereupon such Escrow Agent shall be relieved and
released from any further liability with respect to the Initial Deposit or
the Additional Deposit as Escrow Agent hereunder. Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for Escrow Agents compliance with any legal process, subpoena, writ,
order, judgment and decree of any court, whether issued with or without
jurisdiction, and whether or not subsequently vacated, modified, set aside or
reversed. 

   

 10.11 _Incorporation by Reference_. All of the exhibits and schedules attached hereto are by this reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 

  

 10.12 _Survival_. Except to the extent (i) that Sellers give Purchaser written notice prior to Closing of the untruth or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained herein, (ii) a Purchaser Knowledge Party otherwise obtains actual knowledge prior to Closing of the untruth or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained herein or (iii) of a Non-Breach Inaccuracy, and Purchaser nevertheless elects to close this transaction, the representations and warranties made herein by Sellers and Purchaser shall survive the Closing through but not beyond the Limitation Date (as hereinafter defined) after which such representations and warranties shall merge into the Closing Documents, provided that the aforesaid limitation shall not apply to the prosecution of any claim made and action commenced in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) below on or prior to the Limitation Date. Sellers and Purchaser hereby agree that, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any provision of law to the contrary, any action which may be brought for the untruth or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in this Agreement (a " _Misrepresentation Claim_ ") shall be forever barred: unless (i) no later than ninety one (91) days following the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Limitation Date_ "), the party claiming such Misrepresentation Claim delivers to the other a written notice of the Misrepresentation Claim setting forth the basis for such Misrepresentation Claim, and (ii) such party, no later than six (6) months following the Limitation Date files a complaint or petition against the other party alleging such Misrepresentation Claim in an appropriate Federal district or state court and serves the same upon the party upon whom the claim is made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Misrepresentation Claim that Purchaser may have at any time against Sellers will not be valid or effective, and Sellers shall have no liability with respect thereto, unless the aggregate of all Misrepresentation Claims exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00); provided, however, if such aggregate of all Misrepresentation Claims exceeds such threshold, Purchaser shall be entitled to assert the entire amount of such Misrepresentation Claims. Sellers liability for damages resulting from valid Misrepresentation Claims shall in no event exceed Seven Million Five 

   ##### 

  

 

Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000.00) in the aggregate. The limitations set
forth in this Section 10.12 shall not apply to any claims made by Purchaser
under the Deeds or pursuant to the breach of any representation or warranty
made pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 8.3. 

   

 10.13 _Further Assurances_. Sellers and Purchaser each covenant and agree to (i) sign, execute and deliver, or cause their respective Affiliates to sign, execute and deliver, and to do or make, or cause to be done or made, upon the written request of the other party, any and all agreements, instruments, papers, deeds, acts or things, supplemental, confirmatory or otherwise, as may be reasonably required by either party hereto for the purpose of or in connection with consummating the transactions described herein, and (ii) reasonably cooperate in connection with obtaining any consents from any third parties (including any Governmental Authorities) that are required in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement including the transfer of any real estate tax phase-in agreements, provided that compliance with the provision of this  _Section 10.13_ shall not increase the liability, nor result in the incurrence of any material out-of-pocket expenses, of the complying party. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an Agreement of Inclusion sufficient to cause the 10A permit from the applicable Governmental Authority to apply to the Property on or before Closing, if feasible, and to continue such efforts following the Closing. In addition, the Memorandum of Additional Covenants shall include an obligation on the part of Sellers to pay all costs of maintaining the 10A permit. 

  

 10.14 _No Partnership_. This Agreement does not and shall not be construed to create a partnership, joint venture or any other relationship between the parties hereto except the relationship of seller and purchaser specifically established hereby. 

  

 10.15 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to every provision hereof. 

  

 10.16 _Signatory Exculpation_. The signatory(ies) for Purchaser and Sellers are executing this Agreement in his/their capacity as representative of such party and not individually and, therefore, shall have no personal or individual liability of any kind in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it. 

  

 10.17 _Rules of Construction_. The following rules shall apply to the construction and interpretation of this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated by the context: 

  

 (a) Singular words shall connote the plural number as well as the singular and vice versa, and the masculine shall include the feminine and the neuter. 

  

 (b) All references herein to particular articles, sections, subsections, clauses or exhibits are references to articles, sections, subsections, clauses or exhibits of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The table of contents and headings contained herein are solely for convenience of reference and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement nor shall they affect its meaning, construction or effect. 

  

 (d) Each party hereto and its counsel have reviewed and revised (or requested revisions of) this Agreement and have participated in the preparation of this Agreement, and therefore any usual rules of construction requiring that ambiguities are to be resolved against a 

   ##### 

  

 

particular party shall not be applicable in the construction and
interpretation of this Agreement or any exhibits hereto. 

   

 10.18 _No Recording_. Neither this Agreement nor any memorandum hereof, or any other instrument intended to give notice hereof (or which actually gives notice hereof) shall be recorded. 

  

 10.19 _Facsimile or Electronic Signatures_. The execution of this Agreement and all notices given hereunder and all amendments hereto, may be effected by facsimile or electronic signatures, all of which shall be treated as originals; provided, however, that the party receiving a document with a facsimile signature may, by notice to the other, require the prompt delivery of an original signature to evidence and confirm the delivery of the facsimile signature. 

  

 10.20 _Effective Date_. This Agreement shall be terminable by either Seller or Purchaser prior to the Effective Date. 

  

 10.21 _Tax Deferred Exchange_. Either party hereto may, upon written notice delivered to the other party hereto not later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, structure the transfer of the Property as a tax deferred exchange to such party pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 1031, and each party agrees to cooperate with the exchanging party, and to take such action as the exchanging party may reasonably request in order to consummate such transfer. Any such exchanging party is granted the authority to transfer its rights to this Agreement but not its obligations under an Assignment of Rights Under Contract to be signed by the exchanging party, an exchange entity designated by such exchanging party, and the other party hereto prior to passing title and ownership. At the request of the exchanging party, the other party hereto will sign the written Assignment of Rights Under Contract referred to in this paragraph with the clear understanding that all obligations under the Agreement remain with the exchanging party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the non-exchanging party shall not be required to incur any additional liabilities or financial obligations as a consequence of any such tax deferred exchange, (ii) neither party shall be relieved of its obligations, representations or warranties under this Agreement as a consequence of such tax deferred exchange, (iii) any attempt to structure an acquisition or sale of the Property as a tax deferred exchange shall not be a condition to, and shall not delay or extend, the Closing, (iv) neither party shall be required to acquire title to any property other than the Property, and (v) the legal title to the Property shall be directly deeded over to the Purchaser at Closing. Any risk that the proposed structuring of the transfer of the Property might not qualify as a tax deferred transaction shall be borne solely by the party seeking to effectuate the same, and each party acknowledges that the other has not provided, and will not provide, any tax, accounting, legal or other advice regarding the efficacy of any attempt to structure the transaction as a tax deferred exchange. Each party hereby agrees to save, protect, defend, indemnify and hold the other harmless from any and all losses, costs, claims, liabilities, penalties, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, fees of accountants and other experts, and costs of any judicial or administrative proceeding or alternative dispute resolution to which the other may be exposed, due to any attempt by the indemnifying party to structure the transaction as a tax deferred exchange. 

  

 10.22 _Survival_. The provisions of this _Article X_ shall survive Closing. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement and except as expressly provided in 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 10.12_ hereof, all of the representations and warranties and
covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement shall not survive the
Closing and shall merge into the Closing Documents. Upon Closing, any breach
or default of any such representations or warranties or covenants that do not
expressly survive the Closing, whether known or unknown, shall be
deemed waived by the Closing. 

  

 10.23 _Architectural Issues_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, contained in the Commercial Covenants or the Design Guidelines, La Cantera Development Co. agrees that for so long as Purchaser or any successor thereto owns all of the Hotel Tracts (as depicted on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto) and continues to operate the Hotel thereon, it shall cause the ARC (as such term is defined in the Commercial Covenants) to give approval of proposed improvements to the Property in accordance with the Design Guidelines attached hereto as _Exhibit L_ ("Design Parameters"). If La Cantera Development Co. and Purchaser are unable to agree on Purchasers proposed improvements to the Property, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the arbitration procedure attached hereto as _Exhibit L-1_.
