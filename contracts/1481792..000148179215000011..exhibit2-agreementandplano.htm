RECITALS



A. Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and the Company intend to effect a merger
(the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and the MBCA, with the Company being the surviving company in the
Merger, which Merger will be immediately followed by a merger of the Surviving
Company with and into Merger LLC (the "LLC Merger" and, together with the
Merger, the "Mergers"), in accordance with the MBCA and the LLCA, with the
Merger LLC being the surviving company in the LLC Merger. It is intended that
the Merger be mutually interdependent with and a condition precedent to the
LLC Merger and that the LLC Merger shall, through the binding commitment
evidenced by Section 6.12, be effected immediately following the Effective
Time without further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of
the parties hereto.



B. The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that
it is in the best interests of the Company and the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock ("Shares") to enter into this Agreement providing for,
among other things, the Merger, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the MBCA (other than the
LLC Merger) and (iii) adopted a resolution recommending that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) be approved by
the holders of Shares.C



C. (i) The Board of Directors of Parent has unanimously determined that the
Merger and the LLC Merger are in the best interests of Parent and has approved
and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Mergers, (ii) the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has
unanimously determined that the Merger is in the best interests of Merger Sub
and has approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) Parent, in its capacities
as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and as the sole member of Merger LLC,
shall, immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, as applicable, the Mergers.



D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and

into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into
voting agreements in connection with the Mergers (the "Voting Agreements").

condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
LLC to enter into this Agreement, the Company and Computershare Trust Company,
N.A., as Rights Agent, are entering into an amendment to that certain
Shareholder Rights Agreement between the Company and Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., dated March 18, 2009 (the "Shareholder Rights Plan"), so as to
render the Shareholder Rights Plan, including the preferred stock purchase
rights issuable thereunder, inapplicable to this Agreement, the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Meeting



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the proxy statement
to be sent to the holders of Shares relating to the Stockholders' Meeting and
a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (including a prospectus) (the "S-4
Registration Statement") in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger, of which such proxy statement will form a part
(such proxy statement and prospectus constituting a part thereof, the "Proxy
Statement/Prospectus"). Parent and the Company each shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement declared effective

clear the preliminary Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC as promptly as

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or



omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to
holders of Shares and at the time of the Stockholders' Meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or
Merger LLC for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and (B) Parent assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied in writing by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the S-4 Registration Statement. The Company

with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and
the rules and regulations thereunder.



(c) The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall cooperate with each
other in the preparation of the S-4 Registration Statement, including the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus required thereunder. Each of Parent, Merger Sub,

reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and shall provide any comments thereon as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Parent shall promptly notify the Company and its
counsel of the time when the S-4 Registration Statement has become effective,
of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Further, each party shall promptly
notify the other parties and their counsel of the receipt of any written
comments or other material communications such party or its counsel receives
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the S-4
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall provide
the other party with copies of any written responses to and telephonic
notification of any material verbal responses received from the SEC or its
staff by such party or its counsel with respect to the S-4 Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. If at any time prior to the time
the Stockholder Approval is obtained, any party shall become aware of the
occurrence of any event or other circumstance that requires an amendment or
supplement to the S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
so that the S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as
applicable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then such party shall notify the other party as
promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, and Parent and the Company each
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable thereafter, (i) prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or
supplement and (ii) mail such amendment or supplement to the holders of Shares
to the extent legally required.



(d) As promptly as practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement is
declared effective, the Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a special meeting of



holders of Shares (the "Stockholders' Meeting") to consider and vote upon the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger. Subject to Section 5.4, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and shall take all lawful action to solicit approval of
this Agreement by the holders of Shares. If the Board of Directors of the
Company makes an Adverse Change Recommendation, it will not alter the
obligation of the Company to submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares at
the Stockholders' Meeting to consider and vote upon the approval of this
Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms prior to the Stockholders' Meeting.



Article II



CONVERSION OF SHARES AND DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION



Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, Merger LLC or the holder of any capital stock or other equity security of
Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC or the Company:



(a) Each share of class A common stock, par value $0.025 per share, of Parent
(the "Parent Common Stock"), and each share of class B common stock, par value
$0.025 per share, of Parent issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.



(b) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid, nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
the Surviving Company and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Company.



(c) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly or indirectly by
the Company (other than any share of Company Common Stock held in a trust
account, managed account or the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that is beneficially owned by a third party) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Parent Common Stock or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(d) Except as provided in Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(g) and Section 6.2(c)
with respect to Company Restricted Shares and subject to Section 2.2, each
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as
provided in Section 2.3, either (1) $20.50 in cash, without interest (the
"Cash Consideration"), or (2) 0.9301 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent
Common Stock, without interest (the "Stock Consideration"). The Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration (including cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) are sometimes referred to herein
collectively as the "Merger Consideration."



(e) All Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article II shall no longer be issued or outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and each certificate previously



representing any such Shares or any Book-Entry Share (each, a "Certificate")
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
into which the Shares represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this Section 2.1 as well as any dividends to which holders of
Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.5(c).



(f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) subject
to Section 5.2(b), the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities, in each case, as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split or other similar change in capitalization, or (ii) subject to Section
5.2(a), the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities, in each case, as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split or other similar change in capitalization, then the Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as
the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to Holders with
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event
and, as so adjusted, shall, from and after the date of such event, be the
Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio or other dependent item, as
applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this provision.



(g) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(d), Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who (i) is entitled to
appraisal, (ii) has not voted in favor of this Agreement or the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and (iii) has properly exercised and not
withdrawn or otherwise lost appraisal rights for such Shares in accordance
with Part 13 of the MBCA (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be converted
solely into the right to payment of the fair value of such Shares in
accordance with Part 13 of the MBCA; provided, however, that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder at any time fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA or if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Part 13 of the MBCA, such Shares shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(d), without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such Share
and related documents. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal
of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA that
relate to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.



Section 2.2 Proration



(a) The allocation of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration among Holders will be made as set forth in this Section 2.2(a)
(with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.3(c), whether
fractions of Cash Election Shares, Stock Election Shares or Non-Election
Shares, as applicable, shall be rounded up or down).





(i) If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all
Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and, subject to Section 2.5(f) hereof,
each holder of Stock Election Shares will be entitled to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares held by such
holder equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock
Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock
Election Number, with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Election
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and



(ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number
(the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election
Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and the Cash Election Shares shall
be treated in the following manner:



(A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and, subject to Section 2.5(f) hereof,
each holder of Non-Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with
the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or

(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration and, subject to Section 2.5(f) hereof, each holder of Cash
Election Shares shall receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds
(2) the total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is
the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such
holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration.

Section 2.3 Election Procedures. Each holder of record of Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1 (each, a "Holder") shall have the right, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance
with the following procedures (an "Election"):





(a) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Form of Election") which shall be mailed to Holders so as to permit Holders
to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.



(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Form of
Election to be sent to Holders as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no
event later than five (5) business days) after the Effective Time and to make
available as promptly as reasonably practicable following a request therefor a
Form of Election to any Holder who requests such Form of Election following
the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election
Deadline.



(c) Each Form of Election shall permit Holders (or in the case of nominee
record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all or a
portion of such holder's shares (a "Cash Election"), (ii) elect to receive the
Stock Consideration for all or a portion of such holder's shares (a "Stock
Election"), or (iii) make no election with respect to the receipt of the Cash
Consideration or the Stock Consideration; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
5,206,838 Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Stock Conversion Number") shall be converted into the Stock
Consideration and the remaining Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the Cash Consideration
(the "Cash Consideration Number"). Shares as to which a Cash Election has been
made and Shares that constitute Dissenting Shares as of the Election Deadline
are referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." Shares as to which a Stock
Election has been made are referred to herein as "Stock Election Shares."
Shares as to which no election has been made (or as to which a Form of
Election is not properly completed and returned in a timely fashion) are
referred to herein as "Non-Election Shares." The aggregate number of Shares
with respect to which a Stock Election has been made is referred to herein as
the "Stock Election Number." For the avoidance of doubt, if a Holder does not
submit a properly completed Form of Election in a timely fashion, the Shares
held by such Holder shall be designated Non-Election Shares.



(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Person authorized
to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which Person shall be selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"),
pursuant to an agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company
entered into prior to the mailing of the Form of Election to Holders (the
"Exchange Agent Agreement"), shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a
Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by, in the case
of physical certificates representing Shares, Certificates to which such Form
of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of
such Certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any
registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company
in the United States; provided that such Certificates are in fact delivered to
the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure
to deliver physical certificates representing Shares covered by such a
guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be
deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise
determined by Parent, in its reasonable discretion. For uncertificated Shares
held in book entry form (a "Book-Entry Share"), Parent shall establish
Election procedures for such



Shares, which procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In the
event that a Holder has provided a notice of intent to demand payment (a
"Notice of Dissenter's Intent") pursuant to Section 13.21 of the MBCA, any
Election submitted by such Holder (unless such Notice of Dissenter's Intent
shall have been withdrawn prior to the Election Deadline) shall be deemed
invalid.



(e) As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the
Company, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which
the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the date that is
twenty (20) business days following, but not including, the date of mailing of
the Form of Election.



(f) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if Parent shall
determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made
with respect to any Shares (neither Parent nor the Company nor the Exchange
Agent being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the Shares covered by such
Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares,
unless a proper Election is thereafter made prior to the Election Deadline.



(g) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent, in the
exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing
(i) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Holder with
the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii) the manner and extent to which
Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed
by Section 2.2, (iii) the issuance and delivery of shares of Parent Common
Stock into which Shares are converted in the Merger and (iv) the method of
payment of cash for Shares converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.



Section 2.4 Deposit of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, (i) shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver, and Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) immediately
available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to
the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5(f), the "Exchange Fund"), and
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration,
and such cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided, that (i) no such investment of
or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by
this Article II or Section 6.2, or affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit of, the United
States of America. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect
to such funds shall be the exclusive property of Parent and shall become part
of the Exchange Fund, subject in all cases to the rights of the Holders to
receive the Merger Consideration, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable under this Article II and



Section 6.2 shall be promptly returned to either Parent or the Surviving
Company. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.



Section 2.5 Delivery of Merger Consideration.



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10)
business days) after the Election Deadline, the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each Holder who did not properly complete and timely submit a Form of Election
with such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent,
(i) a letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Company (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent) (the "Letter of
Transmittal") and shall be substantially in such form and have such other
provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance
with this Article II upon surrender of such Certificate and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5(c).



(b) After the Effective Time upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its
Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a
properly completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, a Holder will be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall deliver, or cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, the
Merger Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it, subject to, and in
accordance with Section 2.1(c), Section 2.2 and Section 2.3), including any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor in respect of the Shares formerly represented by
its, his or her Certificate(s). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate
shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate and related
documents in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.



(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to a Holder whose Shares were converted into Stock
Consideration unless and until the Holder has surrendered its, his or her
Certificate and related instruments in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate and related instruments in
accordance with this Article II, such Holder shall be entitled to receive,
without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the
whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which the Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate were converted in accordance with this Article II and not
paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock into
which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted in
accordance with this Article II with a record date after the Effective Time
(but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.





(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be delivered to any
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, it shall be a
condition to the delivery of such Merger Consideration that such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other
similar Taxes (as defined herein) required by reason of the payment or
issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. The Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.5(c) hereof and any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange
Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under
the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be.



(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of any Shares that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of
Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates representing Shares are presented for transfer on the stock
transfer records of the Company, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
accordance with Section 2.2 and the procedures set forth in this Article II.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would
be entitled to receive such fractional share, an amount in cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Cash Consideration
by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to
the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(d).



(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by Holders six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be promptly paid to Parent upon the
request of Parent. Any Holders who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger
Consideration, including any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock, deliverable in respect of each Share that such Holder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Exchange Agent or any other



Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to any Governmental Body pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body, such
Merger Consideration shall become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.



(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as

make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.



(e) The Company has made available through filings with the SEC on the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval database ("EDGAR") or in the
Data Room, to Parent or Parent's Representatives correct and complete copies
of all comment letters received by the Company from the SEC since September
30, 2012 relating to the Company SEC Documents, together with all written
responses of the Company thereto. There are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in any such comment letters received by the Company from the SEC and,
to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the
subject of any ongoing review by the SEC.



(f) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no SEC inquiries or
investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal
investigations pending or threatened in each case regarding any accounting
practices of the Company or any malfeasance by any director or executive
officer of the Company.



(g) No Acquired Corporation is a party to or has any obligation or other
commitment to become a party to any securitization transaction, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to
any transaction or relationship between or among an Acquired Corporation, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose Entity, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, any Acquired Corporation in any Acquired
Corporation's published financial statements or other Company SEC Documents.



(h) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained
in such certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company
does not have, and has not arranged any, outstanding "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.





(i) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.



Section 3.5 Absence of Changes. Except as set forth in Part 3.5 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, since the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2014 through the date of this
Agreement: (a) each of the Acquired Corporations has conducted its business in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice; (b) there has not been any
effect, change, event, occurrence, development, circumstance, condition or
state of facts that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and (c)

Disclosure Schedule, the Acquired Corporations have good and marketable title
to, or valid and enforceable leasehold interests in, all assets owned or
leased by them and that are material to the business of the Acquired

audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of September 27, 2014,
contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 27, 2014 (the "Balance Sheet") filed by the Company with the SEC
(except for assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since the date of such Balance Sheet).
All of said owned assets are owned by the applicable Acquired Corporation free

obligations required to be performed by it under each Lease Agreement, and
there are no outstanding defaults or circumstances which, upon the giving of
notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a material default or

reissue, reexamination or other similar proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, in which the validity, enforceability or
ownership of any Company Registered IP is being contested or challenged (other

(a) Part 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and

such plan that is an International Employee Plan. The Company has made
available to Parent or Parent's Representatives in the Data Room prior to the
date of this Agreement with respect to each material Employee Plan that is a
U.S. Employee Plan (excluding a Multiemployer Plan (as defined below)), to the
extent applicable: (A) current and complete plan documents and all amendments
thereto, and all related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other
funding documents, (B) the most recent determination or opinion letter issued

(b) With respect to any U.S. Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA but is not a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer
Plan"), none of the following has occurred or existed, nor will any of the
following occur or exist as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement: (i) a failure to make on a timely basis any contribution
(including, without limitation, any installment) required under Section 302 or

Section 4042 of ERISA.



(c) With respect to each U.S. Employee Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, Part
3.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule states the amount of estimated

(d) Each of the U.S. Employee Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan) that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a
favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its
qualified status under the Code and to the knowledge of the Company nothing
has occurred that would be reasonably expected to result in the loss of such
qualification. Each of the U.S. Employee Plans (other than a Multiemployer
Plan) is and has for the last three (3) years been operated in compliance with
its terms and all applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, except where
the failure to operate such U.S. Employee Plans in accordance with their terms
and applicable Law did not and could not, individually or in the aggregate,
result in any material liability to the Acquired Corporations. There is no,
nor has there been for the last three (3) years, any litigation or
governmental administrative proceeding, audit or other proceeding or claim
(other than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the knowledge of the
Acquired Corporations, threatened with respect to any U.S. Employee Plan
(other than a Multiemployer Plan), and, to the knowledge of the



Acquired Corporation, there is no reasonable basis for any such litigation,
proceeding, audit or claim, except as would not individually or in the
aggregate be reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Corporation with respect to all U.S. Employee Plans either have been made or
have been accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable U.S. Employee
Plan and applicable Law.



(e) To the knowledge of the Company, no Acquired Corporation, any U.S.
Employee Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) nor any trustee, administrator
or other third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest thereof, has engaged
in any breach of fiduciary responsibility or any non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code) to which Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code applies
and which would subject any Acquired Corporation or any of their ERISA
Affiliates, such U.S. Employee Plan or trustee, administrator or other third-
party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest thereof to a material tax or penalty
on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or to any
material liability under Section 502 of ERISA.



(f) Except as set forth in Part 3.16(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the U.S. Employee Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan) provide
health care or any other non-pension benefits to any Company Associates or
former employees after their employment is terminated (other than as required
by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or similar state law) and, except
as set forth in Part 3.16(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
has never promised to provide such post-termination benefits.



(g) No Acquired Corporation has announced its intention or made any binding
commitment to materially increase participation in or benefits or coverage
under, or terminate, any U.S. Employee Plan or adopt any arrangement or
program which, once established, would come within the definition of a U.S.
Employee Plan. Except as set forth in Part 3.16(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each of the Acquired Corporations has reserved, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the right to amend, terminate or modify at any
time all Employee Plans, except as limited by the terms of a collective
bargaining agreement, and other than with respect to Employee Plans that are
executive compensation contracts and other bi-lateral agreements or
arrangements between an Acquired Corporation on the one hand and an individual
on the other hand.



(h) All International Employee Plans comply in all material respects with
their terms and applicable local Law. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation
relating to any International Employee Plan. With respect to each
International Employee Plan, except as would not reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to an Acquired Corporation: (i) to the knowledge
of the Company, all employer and employee contributions to each International
Employee Plan required by Law or by the terms of such International Employee
Plan have been made or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal
accounting practices; (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, all International
Employee Plans have been established, registered, administered, funded and
invested in accordance with their terms, including the terms of the material
documents that support such International Employee Plan, any applicable labor
contract or similar arrangement and all requirements of applicable Law, (iii)
each International Employee Plan required to be



registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
the appropriate Governmental Body; (iv) to the extent any International
Employee Plan is intended to qualify for special tax treatment, such
International Employee Plan meets all requirements for such treatment; (v) to
the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred respecting any
International Employee Plan that would entitle any person (without the consent
of an Acquired Corporation) to wholly wind-up or terminate any International
Employee Plan; (vi) none of the International Employee Plans provide for
benefit increases or the acceleration of, or an increase in, funding
obligations that are contingent upon, or will be triggered by, the completion
of the transactions contemplated herein (except for employment agreements or
other executive compensation contracts and other bilateral arrangements
between an Acquired Corporation on the one hand and an individual on the other
hand); (vii) there are no unfunded liabilities in respect of any International
Employee Plan, including going concern unfunded liabilities, solvency
deficiencies or wind-up deficiencies where applicable; (viii) none of the
International Employee Plans provide benefits beyond retirement or other
termination of service to employees or former employees or to the
beneficiaries or dependents of such employees; and (ix) there is no
proceeding, action, suit or claim (other than routine claims for payments of
benefits) pending or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened involving any
International Employee Plan or its assets.



(i) With respect to each U.S. Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(l) of the
Code), (i) such plan has been operated in all material respects since January

(a) Since January 1, 2012, Parent has filed (or furnished) on a timely basis
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including
exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and all other information
incorporated therein and amendments and supplements thereto) required to be
filed with (or furnished to) the SEC by Parent (such documents and any such
additional documents filed with (or furnished to) the SEC after the date of
this Agreement, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of its filing (or furnishing)
date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the
last amendment, each Parent SEC Document complied, or if filed (or furnished)
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, will comply, as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Document. As of its filing (or
furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the
date of such latest amendment, no Parent SEC Document contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and no
Parent SEC Document filed with (or furnished to) the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act subsequent to the date of this Agreement will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



(b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents
(i) complied as to form, as of their respective filing dates with the SEC, in
all material respects with the applicable



accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act), and
(iii) fairly presented (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented therein
(subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements).



(c) Parent's system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is reasonably
sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are
executed in accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) that any
unauthorized use, acquisition or disposition of Parent's assets that would
materially affect Parent's financial statements would be detected or prevented
in a timely manner. There were no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses identified in management's assessment of internal controls as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2013 (nor has any such deficiency or
weakness been identified as of the date hereof).



(d) Parent's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.



(e) Parent has delivered, or otherwise made available through filings with the
SEC on EDGAR, to the Company or the Company's Representative's correct and
complete copies of all comment letters received by Parent from the SEC since
January 1, 2012 relating to the Parent SEC Documents, together with all
written responses of Parent thereto. Except as set forth in Part 4.8(e) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
any such comment letters received by Parent from the SEC, and to the knowledge
of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the subject of any ongoing
review by the SEC.



(f) To the knowledge of Parent, there are no SEC inquiries or investigations,
other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal investigations
pending or threatened in each case regarding any accounting practices of
Parent or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of Parent.



(g) None of Parent or its Subsidiaries is a party to or has any obligation or
other commitment to become a party to any securitization transaction, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent or its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any



unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose Entity, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, any of Parent or its Subsidiaries in any of Parent's or its
Subsidiaries' published financial statements or other Parent SEC Documents.



(h) Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal

and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the respective Representatives of the
Acquired Corporations to: (a) provide Parent and Parent's Representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours of the Company to the Acquired

Acquired Corporations; and (b) furnish promptly to Parent and Parent's
Representatives such copies of the existing books, Contracts, projections,
plans, records, filings, submissions, Tax Returns, work papers and other
documents and information relating to the Acquired Corporations, and with such
additional financial, operating and other data and information regarding the
Acquired Corporations' business, properties, prospects and personnel, as
Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that any such access shall
be conducted at Parent's expense, under the supervision of appropriate
personnel of the Company, and in such a manner as to not to interfere
unreasonably with the normal operation of the business of the Company. All
requests for information made pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) shall be

practicable, to Parent a copy of all monthly and other interim financial
statements as the same become available, (ii) cause one or more of its
designated Representatives to confer on a reasonable basis with designated
Representatives of Parent to report operational matters of materiality and the
general status of ongoing operations, including the status of customer
relations, order backlog and future plans to service customer needs, and (iii)
cooperate with Parent as it reasonably requests to assist Parent in planning
to implement Parent's plans for conducting the combined operations of Parent

Sub or Merger LLC shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives
not to, contact any customer or vendor of the Company in connection with the

(b) Nothing in Section 5.1(a) shall require the Company to disclose any
information to Parent (or to take any actions otherwise required to be taken
by it under clause (ii) and clause (iii) of Section 5.1(a)) if such disclosure
or action would, in the Company's reasonable discretion based on the advice of
counsel, (i) jeopardize any attorney client or other legal privilege

Representatives of Parent with appropriate information regarding the factual
basis underlying any circumstances that resulted in the preparation of such
privileged analyses so long as such privilege will not be jeopardized thereby)
or (ii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, including any
confidentiality agreement to which the Company or its Affiliates is a party
(provided, that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to

(and any subsequent changes to such terms and conditions). The Company shall
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding
any such Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions thereof
(including any change in price or form of consideration), including by

Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the

consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to cause the Board of Directors of the Company to violate
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
provided, however, that any such disclosure (other than issuance by the
Company of a "stop, look and listen communication" or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act)

advisability by the Board of Directors of the Company with respect to this
Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Change
Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the Company, in connection

Company's Board of Directors with respect to this Agreement, without
disclosing any Adverse Change Recommendation.





Section 5.4 Company Recommendation.



(a) None of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof shall (i) withhold, fail to include in (or remove from) the

stockholders or declare advisable (or resolve, determine or propose publicly
to adopt, approve, recommend, submit to stockholders or declare advisable) any

Company or any other Acquired Corporation to execute or enter into, any
binding or non-binding letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement,
joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement, commitment,
arrangement or understanding contemplating or otherwise in connection with, or
that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, including any Superior Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to the extent permitted by Section

as an "Adverse Change Recommendation"), except as expressly permitted by this
Section 5.4(b).



(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.3 and Section 5.4(a), at any
time prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Board of
Directors of the Company may approve or recommend, or cause the Company to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for, a Superior Proposal (and, in
each case, make an Adverse Change Recommendation in connection therewith) if
and only if:



(i) the Superior Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 5.3(a) and
the Company did not otherwise breach any of its obligations under Section 5.3
or Section 5.4(a) in any material respect;



(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure to approve or recommend or enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal would reasonably
likely violate the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company
under applicable Law;



(iii) Parent shall have received from the Company prior written notice of the
Company's express intention to approve or recommend or enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal at least four (4) business
days prior to the date of such approval, recommendation or entry; and



(iv) (A) prior to giving effect to clauses (B) through (E) below, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have reasonably determined in good faith, after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and the Company's outside
legal counsel, that the subject Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; (B) the Company shall have provided to Parent in writing the
material



terms and conditions of the subject Acquisition Proposal and copies of all
material documents relating to the subject Acquisition Proposal in accordance
with Section 5.3(c); (C) the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent (and caused its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parent)
during the four (4) business day period provided in the foregoing clause (iii)
of this Section 5.4(b) with respect to any proposed revisions to this
Agreement or other proposals made by Parent, if any, so that the subject
Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; (D) after
considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into account
the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have reasonably determined in good faith that the subject
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
approve or recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the
Superior Proposal would reasonably likely violate the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company under applicable Law; and (E) not later than
earlier of the approval or recommendation of, or the execution and delivery of
a definitive agreement with respect to, the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall have complied with Section 8.1(f) and Section 8.3.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5.4(b) shall
also apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal (except that
any reference to four (4) business days shall instead be three (3) business
days).

in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal

nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to enter into any

Agreement, each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall
cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that

Section 6.2 Company Options, ESPP and Company Stock Awards.



(a) Company Options. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company
Option, whether vested or unvested or exercisable or unexercisable under the
Company Equity Plans, shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into only the right
to receive (without interest), an amount in cash (less applicable Tax
withholdings), payable in a lump sum through the Company's payroll or accounts
payable system as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than the second
payroll period) after the Effective Time, equal to the product of (A) the
excess, if any, of (1) the Cash Consideration over (2) the exercise price per
share of such Company Option, and (B) the number of Shares underlying such
Company Option. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Cash
Consideration is equal to or less than the exercise price per share of a
Company Option, such Company Option shall be cancelled automatically at the
Effective Time without payment or other consideration therefor. Any payment
made pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) to the holder of any Company Option shall
be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding, or other deductions,
required under (A) the Code, (B) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Laws or (C) any other applicable Laws, including pursuant to the terms of any
wage garnishment order.



(b) ESPP. As soon as administratively practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but not later than the day immediately prior to the date on which
the first (1st) offering period that is regularly scheduled to commence under
the ESPP after the date of this Agreement is scheduled to commence, the
Company (or, if appropriate, the applicable committee administering the ESPP)
shall take all actions necessary or required under the ESPP (including, if
appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) and applicable Law to (i) suspend
the ESPP so that (x) no further offering periods shall commence after the date
of this Agreement, (y) no individual participating in any offering period in
progress as of the date of this Agreement shall be permitted to increase the
amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in
effect when the last offering period commenced, or to make separate non-
payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement;
and (z) no individual who is not participating in the ESPP as of the date of
this Agreement may commence participation in



the ESPP following the date of this Agreement, (ii) end the last offering
period that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement on the earlier to
occur of its regularly scheduled end date under the terms of the ESPP or three
(3) calendar days prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) cause the ESPP to
terminate as of the Effective Time such that no further rights shall be
granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter. With respect to the offering
period that is in effect on the date of this Agreement, each ESPP participant
may apply his or her accumulated payroll deductions to purchase shares of the
Company Common Stock under the ESPP in accordance with its terms on the
regularly scheduled purchase date for such offering period; provided, that, if
the Closing Date occurs prior to the purchase date for the offering period,
then each ESPP participant's accumulated payroll deductions under the ESPP
shall be used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP no
later than three (3) business days prior to the Effective Time; provided,
further, that the applicable purchase price per Share as set forth in the ESPP
shall not be decreased below levels set forth in the ESPP as of the date
hereof. All Shares of Company Common Stock purchased under the ESPP shall be
considered outstanding Shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, for purposes of the right to receive the Forms of Election
and to make elections and receive the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto.



(c) Other Stock-Based Awards. At the Effective Time, each award of any kind
consisting of Shares (including any Shares subject to vesting restrictions
and/or forfeiture or repurchase by the Company ("Company Restricted Shares")),
granted under any of the Company Equity Plans that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Company Options and rights under
the ESPP) (each, a "Company Stock Award") shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted
into only the right to receive (without interest), an amount in cash payable
in a lump sum through the Company's payroll or accounts payable system as soon
as reasonably practicable (but no later than the second payroll period) after
the Effective Time, equal to (i) the product of (A) the Cash Consideration and
(B) the number of Shares underlying such Company Stock Award, plus (ii) the
amount set forth in Part 6.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Any
payment made pursuant to this Section 6.2(c) shall be reduced by any income or
employment Tax withholding, or other deductions, required under (A) the Code,
(B) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (C) any other
applicable Laws, including pursuant to the terms of any wage garnishment
order.



(d) Actions Necessary. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Acquired
Corporations, the Board of Directors of the Company and/or the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (x) effectuate the
provisions of this Section 6.2 and (y) ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Company will be required to
deliver Shares or other capital stock of Parent or the Surviving Company to
any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options, any Company Stock
Award or under the ESPP after the Effective Time.



Section 6.3 Employee Benefits. For a period commencing upon the Effective Time
and continuing through the end of the calendar year that includes the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to each Company
Associate who is employed at the Effective Time and continues to be employed
by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent following the Effective



Time (the "Continuing Employees") base salary or base hourly rate, as
applicable, welfare and fringe benefits and annual bonus opportunities (the
"Continuing Benefits"), excluding equity-based compensation and retention and
retirement benefits, that are at least substantially similar in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such obligation shall
not apply to any Continuing Employees who voluntarily transfers to another
position of employment with Parent or an Affiliate after the Effective Time or
who voluntarily elects a reduced work schedule if, as a result of such change
in status, the Continuing Employee's base salary will be modified or the
Continuing Employee does not meet the eligibility requirements under which
such Continuing Benefits are provided. Without limiting the foregoing:



(a) At the Effective Time, with respect to any accrued but unused personal,
sick or vacation time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to
the personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable, assume
the liability for such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such
Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in
accordance with the practice and policies of the applicable Acquired
Corporation.



(b) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Acquired Corporations shall terminate any and all U.S.
Employee Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the
"401(k) Plan(s)"), effective not later than the business day immediately
preceding the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that such
401(k) Plan(s) be terminated, the Acquired Corporations shall provide Parent
with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the Company's Board of Directors not later than two (2) business
days immediately preceding the Effective Time. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably
request. Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make (or
cause to be made) all necessary payments to fund the contributions (i)
necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any such 401(k)
Plan, (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to any such 401(k) Plan for
the period prior to termination, and (iii) for employer matching contributions
(if any) for the period prior to termination. If the Parent does not request
that the 401(k) Plans be terminated prior to the Effective Time, then the
Acquired Corporations shall amend such plans, prior to the Effective Time, to
provide that the cash payments made in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including but not limited to, the payments made pursuant
to Section 6.2 hereof, be excluded from the definition of compensation under
such plans. Whether or not the Parent requests that the 401(k) Plans be
terminated, the Continuing Employees shall be provided, through the end of the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, a 401(k) plan that provides
substantially similar benefits to either the benefits provided under the
401(k) Plans or the benefits that are provided under the Parent's 401(k) Plan
to its eligible employees (subject to the requirements of subsection (c)
below).



(c) Parent agrees that, after the Effective Time, all Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Company's health
and welfare benefit plans to the extent that they were eligible to participate
in such plans prior to the Closing;



provided, however, that (i) nothing in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Company to amend or
terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan at any time, and (ii) if
Parent or the Surviving Company terminates any such health or welfare benefit
plan, then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period) Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Continuing Employees to be eligible
to participate in Parent's or an Affiliate's health and welfare benefit plans,
to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or
its Affiliate (taking into account job location). To the extent that service
is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off)
under any benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Company, Parent shall
use reasonable efforts to cause such benefit plan to (to the extent that it
would not result in any duplication of benefits), for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and allowances (including paid time off) but not for purposes of
benefit accrual, credit Continuing Employees for service prior to the
Effective Time with the Acquired Corporations to the same extent that such
service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding
benefit plan of the Company.



(d) With respect to all employees, the Acquired Corporations shall be
responsible for providing any notices required to be given and otherwise
complying with the WARN or similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction
relating to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar triggering event)
caused by the Acquired Corporations prior to the Effective Time. If Parent
determines that an event would trigger WARN obligations (or obligations
arising under similar statutes or regulations) after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be responsible for providing notices to all employees as are
required to be provided notice under WARN (or any similar statute or
regulation), in a form that is compliant with applicable regulations.



(e) Except as otherwise expressly required by any collective bargaining
agreement to which an Acquired Corporation is a party as of the date of this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement is
intended nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any
particular Employee Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from modifying, amending or
terminating any of its benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any
Employee Plan, (iii) create a right in any Person to employment with Parent,
the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, it being
understood that the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person,
including, without limitation, any employee of the Acquired Corporations or
the Surviving Company, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective
bargaining representative thereof.



(f) Continuing Employees shall be eligible for severance benefits as set forth
in Schedule 6.3(f) and (ii) after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to cause
the Surviving Company to honor the terms, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, of each Contract set forth on Schedule 6.3(f), including by causing
the Surviving Company to pay and provide all post-termination benefits
required to be paid or provided to any individual pursuant to the express
terms, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, of the applicable Contract
in the event that such individual does not become (or ceases to be) a
Continuing Employee after the Effective Time.



Section 6.4 Plan of Reorganization. The parties intend the Merger and the LLC
Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for United
States federal income



tax purposes, to be a reorganization as defined in Section 368(a)(1) of the
Code. The parties will file all Tax Returns consistently with such intention,
and no party will take a position that is inconsistent with that intention
(whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise). This Agreement is intended to
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of section 1.368-2(g)
of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the
date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify, and will not
knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
would prevent the Mergers from qualifying, as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, none of
Parent, the Surviving Company, Merger LLC or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken,
fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action
or failure to act would cause the Mergers to fail to qualify as reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



Section 6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.



(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or
Merger LLC shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or Merger LLC
to) maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time covering each such
person currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided,
however, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.5(a), none of
Parent, Merger LLC or the Surviving Company shall be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 200% of the amount per policy period the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Current
Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed
200% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Company or Merger LLC shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Company's
or Merger LLC's, as the case may be, good faith judgment, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to 200% of the Current Premium.
The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors
and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with
respect to claims arising from acts or omissions that occurred at or before
the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that the amount paid for such prepaid
policies does not exceed 200% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or
Merger LLC shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or Merger LLC
to) maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.



(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or Merger LLC
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company or Merger LLC to): (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time
is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of
the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an "Indemnified Party")
from and against any and all costs, expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel, which shall be advanced as they are incurred, provided that the



Indemnified Party shall have made an undertaking to repay such expenses if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification under this Section 6.5(b)), judgments, fines, penalties or
liabilities (including amounts paid in settlements or compromises) to the
extent sought to be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or other
proceeding (whether civil or criminal, and including any proceeding before any
administrative or legislative body or agency) in which such Indemnified Party
is involved or with which he or she is threatened (regardless of whether as a
named party or as a participant other than as a named party, including as a
witness) (a "Proceeding") (A) by reason of such Indemnified Party's having
been such director or officer or an employee or agent of the Company or
otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of
the Company or (B) arising out of such Indemnified Party's service in
connection with any other corporation or organization for which he or she has
served as director or officer at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company, in each of clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and including any Proceeding
relating to the enforcement of this Section 6.5(b) by an Indemnified Party),
whether or not the Indemnified Party continues in such position at the time
such Proceeding is brought or threatened, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to: (x) each
indemnification agreement in effect between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party as of the date of this Agreement, to
the extent such agreement is disclosed in Part 3.16(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and (y) any indemnification provision (including
advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the
articles of organization or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of
this Agreement. Parent's, Merger LLC's and the Surviving Company's obligations
under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; provided,
however, that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made in good faith by an
Indemnified Party within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim.



(c) If Parent, Merger LLC, the Surviving Company or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent,
Merger LLC or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the
applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.



(d) The provisions of this Section 6.5 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
successors or assigns who by operation of Law, including without limitation,
any estate or probate Law, succeed to the liabilities of such Indemnified
Party, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified Party may have
under any articles of organization or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. After
the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent, Merger LLC and the Surviving
Company under this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 6.5 applies unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have



consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.5 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.5).



Section 6.6 Stockholder Litigation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2)
business days) notify Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at its own expense) in the defense and settlement
of, any Stockholder Litigation; provided, however, that neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall settle or offer to settle any such
Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (other than
settlements that are solely for the payment of cash in an amount that,
collectively with all other settlements or compromises of any Legal
Proceedings (whether or not such Legal Proceedings constitutes Stockholder
Litigation) occurring after the date of this Agreement, do not exceed $500,000
in the aggregate).



Section 6.7 Disclosure. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any
other public statement, or scheduling a press conference or conference call
with investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such other public statement without the consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as such
release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other
party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account
the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance, and the party will consider such comments in good faith;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be required to consult with Parent before issuing any press release or making
any other public statement with respect to an Adverse Change Recommendation
effected in accordance with Section 5.4(b).



Section 6.8 Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes.



(a) If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the
Voting Agreements, then each of the Company and the Board of Directors of the
Company shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
Takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing.



(b) Each of the Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other (and
will subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any material
developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence
or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has, (x) with respect
to the Company, had or would reasonably be expected to result in any Company
Material Adverse Effect and (y) with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or Merger
LLC, had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set
forth in Article VII not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date.





Section 6.9 Section 16 Matters. Promptly after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required
to cause any dispositions of Shares resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.



Section 6.10 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Law and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Company of the Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under

shall have been enacted or promulgated, or/and an Order or other action of a
Governmental Body shall be in effect, in each case, permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that that the right to

available to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the issuance, promulgation, enforcement or entry of any such Order or
other action;



(c) by Parent by written notice to the Company if, prior to the time
Stockholder Approval is obtained, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Stockholder Approval to be obtained;

(f) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the time
the Stockholder Approval is obtained in order to accept a Superior Proposal

under Section 5.3 and Section 5.4 in any material respect, (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company, after complying with all of the applicable
requirements set forth in Section 5.4(b), shall have authorized and directed

cure such breach or failure, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(g) on account of such breach or failure unless such
breach or failure shall remain uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and
the expiration of such thirty (30) day period; provided further, however, that
Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

is the Closing Date); provided, however, that, for purposes of this Section
8.1(h), if such a breach or failure is curable by Parent, Merger Sub or Merger
LLC within the earlier of the End Date and thirty (30) days of the date the
Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure and Parent, Merger Sub
or Merger LLC is continuing to use its reasonable best efforts to cure such

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without

party hereto; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.2, the
penultimate sentence of Section 5.1(a), Section 8.3, Article IX and the
applicable definitions in Exhibit A or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 8.1. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC or the Company shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its intentional breach of any
provision of this Agreement or any fraud; provided, however, that the failure
of any party hereto to consummate the Merger or the LLC Merger on the date
specified in Section 1.1(b) shall constitute an intentional material breach by
such party, and such party shall be liable to the other parties for such
breach as provided herein notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.
The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.





Section 8.3 Termination Fee.



(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses

incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

(i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c);



(ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f); or



(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(g), (B) after the date of this Agreement and at
or prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement, a Third Party shall
have made, commenced or submitted, or publicly announced its intention to
make, commence or submit, an Acquisition Proposal, and (C) the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal within twelve
(12) months after such termination or the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company enters into a definitive agreement within twelve (12) months after
such termination to effect an Acquisition Proposal (provided that, for
purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(iii), all percentages in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be replaced with 50%),



then the Company shall pay to Parent a fee in an amount equal to $10,000,0000
(the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available federal

Parent (x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(i), within two (2) business days
after such termination, (y) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(ii), concurrently
with termination of this Agreement, and (z) in the case of Section
8.3(b)(iii), upon the earlier of the entry into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of an Acquisition
Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under
this Section 8.3(b) shall be payable only once with respect to this Section
8.3(b) and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under
one or more provisions hereof.

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
LLC would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee when due, such fee shall also be deemed to include the costs
and expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC (including fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement
of this Section 8.3, together with interest on such unpaid fee, commencing on
the



date that such fee became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest
published in the "Money Rates" section of The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such fee became due.

remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have waived any

representations or warranties made by itself, with respect to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any other party or any other
party's Representatives of any document or other information with respect to
any one or more of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except for the representations and warranties contained in Article
III (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and Article IV (including the

exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or relating to enforcement of any of the
terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action,
suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party
agrees that notice or the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner
contemplated by Section 9.8 or in any other manner permitted by Law.



(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the

proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 9.5(b) prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under Article VIII (and pursuing damages
after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding
pursuant to this Section 9.5(b) or anything set forth in this Section 9.5(b)
restrict or limit any party's right



to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any
time.
