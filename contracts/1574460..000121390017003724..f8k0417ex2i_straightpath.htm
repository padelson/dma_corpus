1.7 _Directors and Officers_. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties
hereto prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto shall take all actions
necessary so that the officers and the board of directors of Merger Sub at the

or removal in accordance with the Charter and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
each director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the

Article II

  



  

 _CONSIDERATION; EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES_

  



  

2.1 _Consideration; Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company or any capital stock
of Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and fully outstanding
share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(b) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Class A common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company and each share of Class B common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Share_ " or,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, and Shares owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held
on behalf of third parties (each such Share, an " _Excluded Share_ " and
collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right to
receive a number of validly issued, fully paid in and nonassessable
Parent Shares equal to the quotient determined by dividing $95.63 (" _Per
Share Amount_ ") by the Parent Share Value and rounding to the nearest ten-
thousandth of a Share (which consideration shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "
_Certificate_ " it being understood that any reference herein to a "
_Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of Shares) formerly representing any of
the Shares (other than Excluded Shares), and each book-entry account
statement relating to the ownership of Shares (other than Excluded Shares),
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(c) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Except as provided in the second
sentence of this _Section 2.1(c)_ , each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. Each Excluded Share held by
Merger Sub or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or the Company
shall remain outstanding and be unaffected by the Merger.

  



  

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company with the Company's prior approval
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to act
as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates and book-entry shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Parent shall pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
retention and engagement.

  



  

(b) _Deposit. _ Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, any
Parent Shares sufficient to pay any Per Share Merger Consideration that may
be payable from time to time following the Effective Time. All Parent Shares
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Per Share Merger Consideration contemplated to
be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_ ) to the Exchange
Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_ ) to the Exchange Agent.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_ ) to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor one or
more Parent Shares which shall represent, in the aggregate, the whole number
of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_ , less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.2(h)_. The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Parent Shares to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(d) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for (without interest and after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_ ) that number of
Parent Shares equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by the
Certificate multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_ ) upon due
surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_ ), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(f) _No Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or cancellation of In-the-Money Options. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Shares converted pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a Parent Share (after taking into account all Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) delivered by such holder) shall be
entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.2(f)_ , a cash payment in lieu of such
fractional shares representing such holder's proportionate interest, if any,
in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of
the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) (as so reduced, the " _share
proceeds_ ") in one or more transactions of a number of Parent Shares, such
number equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of Parent Shares to be
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ over
(ii) the aggregate number of whole Parent Shares to be distributed to the
holders of Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ (such excess being the "
_Excess Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash share
proceeds in lieu of issuing certificates or scrip for fractional shares was
not separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent
for the holders of the certificates representing Parent Shares that would
otherwise receive fractional shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then
prevailing prices on the NYSE in the manner provided in this _Section 2.2(f)_
and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the share
proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of such
Shares, or the Exchange Fund is terminated, the Exchange Agent shall hold
such share proceeds in trust for the benefit of the holders of such Shares
(the " _Fractional Share Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the Fractional Share Proceeds to which each holder of such Shares
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate share
proceeds comprising the Fractional Share Proceeds by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to
which such holder of such Shares would otherwise be entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of such Shares would otherwise be entitled.

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, (i) upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and (ii) if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by
Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue the Per Share Merger Consideration such Person has a right to
receive pursuant to _Article II_ (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_ ).

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Shares or In-the-Money Options such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

2.3 _Treatment of Incentive Equity_.

  



  

(a) _Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding option, whether vested or unvested, to purchase Shares that was
granted under the 2013 Plan (each such option, a " _Company Option_ ") shall
be terminated and cancelled. The holder of a Company Option having an
exercise price that is less than the Per Share Amount, (such Company Option,
an " _In-the-Money Option_ ") shall be entitled to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a number of Parent Shares
equal to the quotient determined by dividing (i) the excess, if any, of (x)
the Per Share Amount over (y) the per-Share exercise price for the Shares
that would have been issuable upon exercise of such In-the-Money Option (with
the understanding that, for purposes of this clause, if there are different
exercise prices for different In-the-Money Options held by the same holder,
separate calculations shall be made for each exercise price), by (ii) the
Parent Share Value and rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a Share. The
holder of any such Company Option that is not an In-the-Money Option shall
have no further rights or entitlements with respect thereto. Parent shall pay
to each holder of In-the-Money Options cash in lieu of fractional shares to
which such holder would be entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_ ;
_provided_ that the calculation of the amount of such fractional shares shall
be determined on an aggregate basis taking into account all In-the-Money
Option grants held by such holder.

  



  

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each vested and
unvested share of restricted stock granted pursuant to the 2013 Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such share, a share
of " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall be terminated and cancelled and
shall only entitle the holder of each such share of Company Restricted Stock
to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an
amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration (without interest and
after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section

or a different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including
a reverse stock split), stock dividend, stock distribution, recapitalization,
merger (other than the Merger), issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES oF THE COMPANY_

  



  

Except as set forth (a) in the Company Reports filed with or furnished to the
SEC after the Applicable Date and prior to the date of this Agreement to the
extent that the qualifying nature of such disclosure with respect to a
specific representation and warranty is readily apparent (excluding, in each
case, any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (b) in the
corresponding Sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to
Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
Section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other Section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is readily apparent), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

3.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in such good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement correct
and complete copies of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' certificates of
incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents, each as amended
to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and
effect.

3.2 _Capital Structure_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i)
2,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, of which 787,163 shares
were outstanding as of the close of business on April 7, 2017, (ii)
40,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, of which 11,701,349 shares were
outstanding as of the close of business on April 7, 2017, and of which 314,375
shares constituted shares of Company Restricted Stock and 39,693 shares are
held by the Company in its treasury, and (iii) 3,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Shares_ "), of which no Preferred
Shares are outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of April
7, 2017, an aggregate of 98,210 Company Options were outstanding with respect
to shares of Class B common stock. The Company has no shares of Class A common
stock, Class B common stock, preferred stock or shares of any other class or
series of capital stock reserved for issuance or subject to issuance, except
that as of April 7, 2017, there were an aggregate of 124,033 shares of Class B
common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to Company Options under the 2013
Plan. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of
each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any
Encumbrance or other restriction or limitation (including any limitations on
the right to vote or transfer any such shares). There are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options (other than Company Options), warrants,
conversion rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. The Company does
not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, indebtedness, notes or other
obligations (x) the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter or (y) that are required to be
registered under the Exchange Act. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a complete and correct list as of April 7, 2017, of the
outstanding Company Options and Company Restricted Stock and all warrants and
other options, contracts or rights to acquire shares of capital stock of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, including the holder, date of grant, term, number
of shares, exercise price and vesting schedule. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has issued any stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights
or other similar rights.

(b) _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (i)
each of the Company's Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company
in each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person
or Person in each such Subsidiary and (ii) the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership
interest in any other Person other than securities in a publicly traded
company held for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
consisting of less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such company.

  



  

(c) Each Company Option (i) was granted in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the
2013 Plan, (ii) has an exercise price or reference price per Share equal to or
greater than the fair market value of a Share on the date of such grant, and
(iii) complies in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(d) Except as expressly contemplated by the Voting Agreement, there are
no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the
capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

3.3 _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

  



  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has
taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject
only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the votes
that can be cast by holders of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such
matter at a stockholders' meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the
" _Requisite Company Vote_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights and to general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ ").

  



  

(b) The Company Board has (i) unanimously determined that the Merger is
fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and resolved to
recommend adoption of this Agreement to the holders of Shares (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "), (ii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
holders of Shares for their adoption and (iii) received the opinion of its
financial advisor, Evercore, to the effect that the Per Share Merger
Consideration is fair from a financial point of view, as of the date of such
opinion and subject to the limitations and qualifications therein, to the
holders (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) of Shares. The Company Board
has taken all action so that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will be
an "interested stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating
a "business combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used
in _Section 203_ of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement
or the Voting Agreement or the consummation of the transactions in the manner
contemplated hereby.

3.4 _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts, Etc._

, (ii) under the HSR Act, (iii) under the Communications Act, including any
rules, regulations and orders (the " _FCC Rules_ ") of the FCC, (iv) under the
rules and regulations of the NYSE and (v) under any state securities or "blue
sky" laws, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by
the Company or its Subsidiaries with, nor are any consents, registrations,
approvals, Permits or authorizations required to be obtained by the Company
or its Subsidiaries from, any Governmental Entity, in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, constitute or
result in

  



  

(i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing documents
of any Company Subsidiary,

  



  

(ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination or modification)
or default under, payment of additional fees under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of an Encumbrance on
any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
agreement, lease, license, contract, consent, settlement, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement, understanding or other obligation (each, a "
_Contract_ ") binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby) compliance with the matters referred to in _Section 3.4(a)_ and
receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, under any Law, Order or Permit to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or

  



  

(iii) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any
Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

  



  

except, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) above, for any such breach,
violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.5 _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely
basis, all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required
to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, or
the Securities Act, since December 31, 2014 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents filed or furnished
since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date
of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_
"). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished
complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective dates
(or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with
or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

  



  

(b) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NYSE. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and
(3), or rules of the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified
(in any material way) any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan
to any executive officer or director of the Company.

  



  

(c) The Company has established and maintains a system of disclosure
controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in periodic
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC. The Company maintains internal control over all material
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable,
under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over material financial
reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of
its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date
of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
its internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and has identified for the Company's auditors
and audit committee of the Company Board any material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. Since the Applicable
Date, no material complaints from any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from
Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have
been received by the Company.

---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated
by reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case of
Company Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated balance
sheets, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated changes
in stockholders' equity and consolidated statements of cash flows included in
or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or in the case
of Company Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations,
retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as the case may
be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect), in each case in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC and GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as may be noted therein or in the notes thereto. There are no material off-
balance sheet arrangements of any type required to be disclosed pursuant to
Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K that have not been so described in the
Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof nor any obligations to enter
into any such arrangements. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
material outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from
the SEC or its staff.

  



  

3.6 _FCC Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Section 3.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
correct and complete list of all FCC Licenses, all pending applications by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for licenses that would be FCC Licenses
if issued or granted, and all pending applications by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for modification, extension or renewal of any FCC License.
For each FCC License, _Section 3.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth, as applicable, the complete and correct (i) FCC Registration Number ("
_FRN_ ") and name of the licensee or holder of the authorization, (ii) FCC
call sign, license number or other license or authorization identifier, (iii)
name of the radio service and FCC Radio Service Code or other service and
service designations used by the FCC for the type of authorization in
question, (iv) geographic area for which the Company and its Subsidiaries are
authorized to provide service, (v) frequency block or description of
authorized spectrum band, and (vi) grant date, renewal date and current
expiration date. The FCC Licenses constitute all the licenses and
authorizations necessary from the FCC for the business operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as they are currently being conducted.
Except as set forth in the FCC Consent Decree, there is no condition outside
of the ordinary course imposed on any of the FCC Licenses by the FCC
(including any condition on the grant of a renewal application) that is not
disclosed on the face of the reference copy of the FCC License in the FCC's
Universal Licensing System or database or other FCC database; provided, that
"ordinary course" shall mean any condition described in any federal statutes,
FCC Rules or similar sources that apply generally to FCC licenses of the same
service.

  



  

(b) Each FCC License has been granted by the FCC pursuant to a Final
Order (without regard to the proviso in the definition of such term) to be
held by the licensee listed on _Section 3.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, is valid and in full force and effect, and has not been suspended,
revoked, cancelled, terminated or forfeited or adversely modified. There is no
proceeding pending before the FCC or any other Governmental Entity (and no
pending judicial review of such a proceeding) or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened by any Person with respect to any FCC License that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in the
suspension, revocation, cancellation, termination, forfeiture, or adverse
modification of any FCC License. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event,
condition or circumstance exists or, after notice or lapse of time or both,
would exist that would constitute a breach of, or default under, the terms
and conditions of any FCC License or the FCC Consent Decree that would
preclude any FCC License from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the
extent that such FCC License is renewable by its terms) or could reasonably
be expected to place such FCC license at risk of suspension, revocation,
cancellation, termination, forfeiture or modification.

  



  

   

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(c) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the
terms of the FCC Consent Decree and, in all material respects, with the FCC
Rules and any other Laws that apply to, or that are contained in, each FCC
License and has timely fulfilled and performed all of its material
obligations with respect thereto, including making all reports, filings,
notifications and applications to the FCC. The Company has provided Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement with access to copies of each such report,
filing, notification and application, including ownership reports and
regulatory fee filings, filed in the last three (3) years, with the exception
of those reports, filings, notifications and applications that are available
in their entirety in the FCC's Universal Licensing System database. Except as
would not be material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any misstatements of fact, or
omitted to disclose any material fact, to any Governmental Entity or in any
report, document or certificate filed therewith. Except as would not be
material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company has not
incurred, or if incurred the Company has fully discharged, any fine, charge or
other liability resulting from any noncompliance prior to the Closing
relating to such reports, filings, notifications and applications. Except as
would not be material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company
has timely made the payment of all regulatory fees and contributions to the
FCC, the United States Treasury or any other Governmental Entity with respect
to any FCC License or which are otherwise required by the FCC Rules,
including Universal Service Fund and TRS Fund contributions. Except as set
forth in _Section 3.6(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no payment is
owed to the FCC or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the
ownership and operation of any FCC License. The consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby will not cause the FCC to impose any unjust
enrichment penalties pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 1.2111.

  



  

(d) Except as would not be material to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, none of the FCC Licenses has been modified by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in any respect. There is no pending or planned application by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to modify any FCC License. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have (i) entered into any field-strength
agreements or otherwise granted any Interference Consents with respect to any
of the spectrum that is the subject of any of the FCC Licenses, or
(ii) waived or relinquished any material right or claim with respect to any
of the spectrum that is the subject of any FCC License.

  



  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has a spectrum
lease with any other Person (other than leases solely among the
Company and/or direct or indirect Subsidiaries of the Company) and no other
Person has any right, title or interest in or with respect to any FCC License
or any right to use any spectrum covered by any FCC License.

its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses, in all material
respects, in the ordinary course of such businesses consistent with past

action that would have been prohibited by _Section 5.1_ of this Agreement if
such action were taken after the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  



  

3.8 _Litigation and Liabilities_. As of the date of this Agreement,

3.9 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) _Section 3.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
correct and complete list of each Benefit Plan. The Company has provided or
made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement correct and
complete copies of all the Benefit Plans and all amendments thereto and any
current summary plan descriptions, most recent Forms 5500 with schedules, and
most recent IRS determination or opinion letters, in each case, to the extent
applicable.

  



  

(b) Each of the Benefit Plans is currently in, and has at all times

be qualified under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter or is the subject of an opinion letter from the
IRS and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the
loss of the qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan that, assuming the Taxable
period of such transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, could
subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a material Tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to
incur a material Tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

  



  

(c) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any trade or

them under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code has within the past
six (6) years contributed to, sponsored or maintained any "employee pension
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Section 312 of ERISA, including a
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(d) None of the Benefit Plans provides retiree or post-employment
medical, disability, life insurance or other retiree welfare benefits except
as may be required by applicable Law.

  



  

(e)  All material contributions required to be made under each Benefit
Plan, as of the date of this Agreement, have been timely made when due and
all obligations in respect of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued on
the Company's balance sheet prior to the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(f) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (i) no actions, suits or claims
(other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course, and appeals
thereof) are pending or threatened in writing, and (ii) no administrative
investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the United States
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the IRS or
other Governmental Entities are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened.

  



  

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 3.9(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder adoption of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(i) entitle any employees, directors, consultants, former employees, former
consultants or former directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
severance, change of control or other similar pay or benefits pursuant to any
Benefit Plan, (ii) cause any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) to become due or accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation or benefits to any employees, directors,
consultants, former employees, former consultants or former directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or increase the amount payable or
trigger any other obligation pursuant to, any Benefit Plan, (iii) limit or
restrict the right of the Company or its Subsidiaries or, after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit
Plans or (iv) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans which would
not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross up, indemnify or otherwise
reimburse any individual for any Taxes, interest or penalties incurred
pursuant to Sections 409A, 280G or 4999 of the Code or otherwise.

  



  

(h) The Company and its Subsidiaries have no material liability by
reason of an individual who performs or performed services for the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries in any capacity being improperly excluded from
participating in a Benefit Plan.

  



  

3.10 _Labor Matters_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement or
other Contract with a labor union or labor organization, nor is the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any proceeding that asserts that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or
that seeks to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization
nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor
has there been since the Applicable Date, any labor strike, dispute, walk-
out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company or any of its

Except as set forth (a) in the Parent Reports filed with or furnished to the
SEC after the Applicable Date and prior to the date of this Agreement to the
extent that the qualifying nature of such disclosure with respect to a
specific representation and warranty is readily apparent (excluding, in each
case, any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (b) the corresponding

any other Section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is readily
apparent), Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

  



  

   

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

4.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing
as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or
in such good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the
organizational documents of each of Parent and Merger Sub, each as in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

4.2 _Capital Stock of Parent._ Each Parent Share issued or transferred
as part of the Per Share Merger Consideration has been or will be when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except
as otherwise disclosed in the Parent Reports and excluding any rights issued
under the employee benefit plans of Parent, (a) there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, redemption
rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or
rights of any kind that obligate Parent to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other securities of Parent or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or that give any Person the right to receive any economic or
voting interest of a nature accruing to the holders of Parent Shares, and (b)
Parent does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders
of Parent on any matter.

  



  

4.3 _Corporate Authority_. No vote of holders of capital stock of
Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite power and authority and has taken all action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement and the Voting
Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger
Sub and, assuming this Agreement and the Voting Agreement constitute valid
and binding agreements of the other parties hereto, constitute valid and
binding agreements of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, enforceable
against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with their respective
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  



  

4.4 _Parent Reports; Financial Statements._

  



  

(a) Parent has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis,
all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be
filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, or the
Securities Act, since the Applicable Date (the forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable
Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
including any amendments thereto, the " _Parent Reports_ ") _._ Each of the
Parent Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished, complied or, if
not yet filed or furnished, will comply, in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
applicable to the Parent Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), the Parent Reports did not, and any Parent Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made

misleading.

(b) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

  



  

(c) Parent has established and maintains a system of disclosure
controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information required to be disclosed by Parent in periodic
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC. Parent maintains internal control over all material
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable,
under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over material financial
reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation
of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the
date of this Agreement, to Parent's auditors and the audit committee of the
Parent Board (i) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
its internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and has identified for Parent's auditors and audit
committee of the Parent Board any material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent's internal control over financial reporting.

  



  

(d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated
by reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case of Parent
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated balance
sheets, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated
changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated statements of cash flows
included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including
any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or
in the case of Parent Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as
the case may be, of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
the absence of notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be
material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC and GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as may be noted therein or in the notes thereto.
There are no material off-balance sheet arrangements of any type required to
be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K that have not been
so described in the Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof nor any
obligations to enter into any such arrangements. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no material outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the SEC or its staff.

Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger, the other

impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by

Subsidiaries' directors, officers and employees not to, and shall instruct and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

  



  

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any

regarding any Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(iii) provide any non-public information or data concerning the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with any

Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly inform the
individuals and entities referred to in the preceding sentence hereof of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section 5.2_. The Company will
promptly request from each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of making an
Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
promptly terminate all physical and electronic data access previously granted
to such Person.

  



  

   

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.2(a)_ , prior to the
time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may,
in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, (i)
provide access to non-public information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that such information has previously been made available to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time such information is
made available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such material
non-public information, the Company receives from the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at
least as restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the
Confidentiality Agreement's terms are on Parent (it being understood that
such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of an
Acquisition Proposal); and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal if, and
only if, prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the
Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that (A) based on the information then available and after
consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(c) _Notice_. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within
forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent if (i) any written or other bona
fide inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
are received by the Company, (ii) any non-public information is requested in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal from the Company, or (iii) any
discussions or negotiation with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought
to be initiated or continued with the Company, indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of
any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of
any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status
of any such discussions or negotiations.

  



  

(d) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Except as provided in _Section 5.2(e)_ and _Section 5.2(f)_ , the
Company Board and each committee of the Company Board shall not (i) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that publicly taking a
neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal at
any time beyond ten Business Days after the first public announcement of such
Acquisition Proposal by the Company or by the party which made the Acquisition
Proposal shall be considered a modification adverse to Parent) or make or
authorize the making of any statement (oral or written) that has the
substantive effect of such a withdrawal, qualification or modification (each,
a " _Change in Recommendation_ "); (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
lease agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section 5.2(b)_ entered into in compliance with _Section
5.2(a)_ ) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(e) _Fiduciary Exception to Change in Recommendation Provision_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_
, following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal by the Company after
the date of this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 5.2_ and the Company Board determining in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, at any time prior to
the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, make a Change in
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance
with _Section 5.2(e)(ii)_ , or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly
to take any such action, only if all of the following conditions are met:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent five (5) Business
Days' prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has
received a written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(2) the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (including
the consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group
making the Acquisition Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided
an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all
other documents (other than immaterial documents) related to the Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period) and (3)
that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company Board has determined to effect
a Change in Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.3(b)_ in order to enter into the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, as applicable, and (B) prior to making such a Change in
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement in accordance with _Section
7.3(b)_ , as applicable, (x) to the extent requested by Parent in good faith,
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent during such notice period to
amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (y) in determining
whether to make a Change in Recommendation and/or to effect such a
termination in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_ , the Board of Directors of
the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent in
response to such notice; and

  



  

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
proposed by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make such Change in Recommendation or to so
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_ , as applicable,
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

  



  

   

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(f) _Change in Recommendation._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_ , upon the occurrence of
any Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the time
the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, make a Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.3(c)_ , or authorize,
resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, only if all of
the following conditions are met:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent ten (10) Business
Days' prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Change
in Recommendation or the decision to terminate this Agreement, as the case
may be, and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii) below, the
Company Board has determined to effect a Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement and (B) prior to making such a Change in
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement, to the extent requested by
Parent in good faith, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent during
such ten (10) Business Day notice period to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the failure of the Company Board to make a Change in
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in response to the Intervening
Event in accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and

  



  

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such
Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by
Parent, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(g) _Limits on Release of Standstill and Confidentiality_. From the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall not
terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be
permitted to fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar obligation of any Person if the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably necessary
in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company promptly advises Parent that it
is taking such action and the identity of the party or parties with respect
to which it is taking such action; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not restrict the Company from permitting a Person to orally
request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation to the extent
necessary to comply with fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(h) _Compliance with Certain Laws_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from taking
actions to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , that
(i) if such disclosure has the effect or substantive effect of withholding,
withdrawing, qualifying or modifying the Company Recommendation, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation and Parent shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 7.4(a)_
and (ii) in no event shall the Company take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action other than in compliance with this _Section 5.2_.

5.3 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus_.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement), the
Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Company and Parent shall prepare and Parent
shall file with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the
Company's proxy statement and Parent's prospectus will be included (together
with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_
"). Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as
necessary to consummate the Merger, this Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act in order to
allow the Stockholders Meeting to occur within forty-five (45) days following
the date on which the Form S-4 was declared effective. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
made by the Company or Parent, in each case without providing the other party
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so
that either such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  



  

(b) The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the staff of the SEC (the " _Staff_ ") and of any request by
the Staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the Staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4, the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to
the Form S-4. Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the Staff with respect
to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or responding to any comments of the Staff with
respect thereto, each party ( _i_ ) shall provide the other parties with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and
( _ii_ ) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably
proposed by the other parties.

5.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all
action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, and
shall not postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting except to the extent
required by Law or, if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there
are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting
to adopt this Agreement or to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Stockholders Meeting. The Company Board shall take all lawful
action to solicit such adoption of this Agreement and, subject to _Sections
5.2(e)_ and  _5.2(f)_ , shall recommend such adoption. In the event that
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board makes a Change in
Recommendation, the Company nevertheless shall submit this Agreement to the
holders of the Shares for adoption at the Stockholders Meeting unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the
Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the
adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by Law to be voted on by the Company's

the other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Form S-4, Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this

related thereto) and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested;
provided that no investigation pursuant to this  _Section 5.8_ shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company
herein; and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require the
Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that
in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties, violate any applicable Laws
or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality or (ii) to
disclose any information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the
disclosure of which would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of this
_Section 5.8_ , the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(1) obtain the required consent of any such third party to provide such
inspection or disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company and (3) utilize the procedures of a joint defense
agreement or implement such other techniques if the parties determine that
doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without
violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. To the extent
that any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this _Section
5.8_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include
material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal
proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree
that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it
is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such
material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the
confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,
this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. All requests for
information made pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ shall be directed to the
executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the applicable Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall survive the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms set forth therein.

necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules
and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. The

national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity;

5.11 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remained
employed by Company and its Subsidiaries (each a " _Company Employee_ ") will
be provided with (i) base compensation that is at least equal to the base
compensation in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and target
annual incentive compensation that is substantially the same as
comparable employees of Parent and (ii) employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by Parent to its
comparable employees. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to _Section
5.11(b)_ below, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to,
provide each Company Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or one
of its Subsidiaries without cause during the one-year period following the
Effective Time with severance payments and benefits at levels and
amounts, and on terms and conditions, no less favorable than those provided
by Parent to its comparable employees.

  



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company
or its Subsidiaries to honor the arrangements identified on
_Section 5.1(a)(xix)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Closing
and in which any Company Employee participates (the " _Parent Plans_ "), for
all purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting requirements and
benefit accrual, contribution rates and matching amounts, each Company
Employee's service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or predecessor
employers for which Company or its Subsidiaries provide past service credit)
shall be treated as service with Parent and/or any applicable Subsidiary of
Parent; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period of service, for purposes of any frozen or discontinued Parent Plan or
any frozen or discontinued portion of a Parent Plan or for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan. Parent shall cause (i)
such service to apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or
evidence of insurability requirements and (ii) each Parent Plan to waive pre-
existing condition limitations for employees (and their beneficiaries and
covered dependents) participating in such plan to the extent waived or not
applicable under the applicable Benefit Plan. Parent shall, upon written
request with supporting documentation, reimburse each Company Employee for
any deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans of Parent
that such Company Employees are eligible to participate in following the
Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i)
be treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) alter or
limit the ability of Parent to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan,
Parent Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
(iii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this
_Section 5.11_ , (iv) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee or (v) be deemed to confer upon any
such individual or legal representative any rights under or with respect to
any plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated by this
Agreement, and each such individual or legal representative shall be entitled
to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or arrangement for
his or her rights thereunder.

expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall be responsible for all
fees incurred in connection with (a) all applications required to be filed
with the FCC, (b) the filing of the notification and report form required
under the HSR Act and (c) the filing fee paid to the SEC in connection with
the filing of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

  



  

5.13 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under the DGCL
and its certificate of incorporation or by-laws as in effect on the date of
this Agreement to indemnify such Person and each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ ,that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section 5.13(a)_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any fees and expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Parent and the Surviving Corporation elect not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are
issues which present conflicts of interest between Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Parties, on the other, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received;  _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this _Section 5.13(b)_ to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest; provided that the fewest number of counsels necessary to
avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate with the Surviving Corporation in the defense of any such matter,
and (iii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and
such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

a claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from
one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies in an amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason
fail to obtain such " _tail_ " insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage
at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the
date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company
expend, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and provided, further, that
if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(d) Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill its
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.13_. If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (i) take all actions necessary to
maintain and preserve the FCC Licenses and (ii) refrain from taking any action
that would give the FCC or any other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction
over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries grounds to institute proceedings
for the suspension, revocation or adverse modification of any FCC License.

_Section 6.2(a)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied unless the failure of
such representations and warranties of the Company to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect (without giving effect to any " _Material
Adverse Effect_ ," " _materiality_ " or similar qualifications contained
therein); and (v) Parent shall have received at the Closing a certificate
signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
to the effect that the conditions set forth in this _Section 6.2(a) _ have

(c) _No Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of this Agreement,
there shall not have occurred any change, event, circumstances or development

(d) _FCC Consent Final Order_. The FCC Consent shall have become a
Final Order without the imposition of any Adverse Regulatory Condition.

Company to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by
the Company at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

  



  

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. (i) The representations and
warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of such date and time (except to the
extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an
earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such earlier date), and (ii) the Company shall have received
at the Closing a certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by an
executive officer of Parent to the effect that the conditions set forth in
this  _Section 6.3(a)_ have been satisfied.

signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by an executive officer of Parent
to such effect.

  



  

(c) _Tax Opinion._ The Company shall have received from Weil, Gotshal
and Manges LLP, tax counsel to the Company, a written opinion dated as of the
Closing Date to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the Merger will qualify
for United States federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinions,
Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP may rely upon certificates of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub substantially in the form of the certificates attached hereto
as _Exhibit C_ and _Exhibit D_.

  



  

(d) _Listing of Parent Shares._ The Parent Shares deliverable to the
stockholders of the Company as contemplated by this Agreement shall have been

or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ , _Section 6.2(b)_, _Section 6.2(c)_, _Section 6.3(a)_ or
_Section 6.3(b)_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such party's breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement.

7.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

  



  

(a) Except as provided in _Section 7.5(b)_ , in the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to
this _Article VII_ , this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
Representatives or Affiliates); provided, however, and notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages to the other party
hereto resulting from any material breach of this Agreement and (ii) this
_Section 7.5_ and the sections identified in the second sentence of _Section
8.1_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that:

  



  

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) by either the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ (Stockholder No Vote or (2) by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.4(d)_ (Company Breach), (B) a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of its stockholders or
any Person shall have publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company (and such Acquisition Proposal or
publicly announced intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn, and (C)
within twelve (12) months after such termination (1) the Company shall have
entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (substituting "50%" for "30%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal") which is ultimately consummated or (2) there shall
have been consummated an Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4_
(other than pursuant to _Section 7.4(d)_ (Company Breach));

  



  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.2(b)_ (Stockholder No Vote) and, on or prior to the date of the
Stockholders Meeting, any event giving rise to Parent's right to terminate
pursuant to _Section 7.4_ (other than pursuant to _Section 7.4(d)_ (Company
Breach)) shall have occurred;

  



  

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)_ ; or

  



  

(v) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.3(c)_ ;

  



  

then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business
Days after the date of such termination, pay Parent the Company Termination
Fee, payable by wire transfer of same day funds.

  



  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ and on such date all of the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied or waived other than the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ (HSR Act) and _Section 6.1(c)_ (FCC)
and those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing, then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination, pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of same day funds. In the event of
any termination of this Agreement that triggers payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, then Parent shall make an additional payment to the Company
in an amount equal to the difference between $85,000,000 and the Parent
Termination Fee as liquidated damages.

---|---|--- 

 

    



  

(d) The Company and Parent each acknowledge that the agreements
contained in _Section 7.5(b)_ (i) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement and
(iii) any amount payable pursuant to _Section 7.5(b)_ does not constitute a
penalty; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to _Section 7.5(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment or
performance, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the fee set forth in _Section 7.5(b)_ or any portion
of such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate as published in the
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made from the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment. In the event the Company Termination Fee is paid to Parent in
circumstances for which such fee is payable pursuant hereto, payment of the
Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Merger Sub against the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
advisors or Affiliates for any damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach of or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise relating to or arising
out of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company Termination
fee shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or Merger Sub in the
event that the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are a result of the Company's material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(e) The Company and Parent each acknowledge that the agreements
contained in _Section 7.5(c)_ (i) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement and
(iii) any amount payable pursuant to _Section 7.5(c)_ does not constitute a
penalty; accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay the amounts due
pursuant to _Section 7.5(c)_ and, in order to obtain such payment or
performance, the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against
Parent for the fee set forth in _Section 7.5(c)_ or any portion of such fee,
Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of
the fee at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made from the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment. In the event the
Parent Termination Fee (and such additional amounts referenced in _Section
7.5(c)_ ) is paid to the Company in circumstances for which such fee is
payable pursuant hereto, payment of the Parent Termination Fee (and such
additional amounts referenced in _Section 7.5(c)_ ) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub, their Subsidiaries
or any of their respective former, current or future stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, advisors or Affiliates for any damages suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach of or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise
relating to or arising out of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Parent Termination Fee (and such additional amounts referenced in
_Section 7.5(c)_ ) shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
in the event that the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are a result of Parent's or Merger Sub's material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) The Company has or may have set forth information in the Company
Disclosure Letter in a Section of the Company Disclosure Letter

is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  



  

8.13 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto, except that the Agreement may be assigned by

such assignment shall not be released from its obligations hereunder. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is
void.

  



  

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies (including
those as set forth in _Section 7.5_) would not be an adequate remedy for any
such non-performance or breach. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to
_Sections 7.5(d)_ and _7.5(e)_ , the parties to this Agreement shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened

by which it or any of its assets or properties is bound or (iv) result in the
creation of any Liens upon any of the assets or properties of the Trust,

arising out of a breach of this _Section 4.3_ or _Section 5.2(a)_ of the
Merger Agreement.

the Company, any of the other parties to the Merger Agreement or any of their
respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery of
this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger, including any proceeding (a) challenging the validity of, or seeking
to enjoin the operation of, any provision of this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement or (b) alleging a breach of any fiduciary duty of any Person in
connection with the negotiation and entry into this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement. Each of the Trust and Mr. Jonas hereby (i) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to exercise, assert or perfect, any
rights to demand appraisal of the Covered Shares or rights of dissent,
and (ii) agrees to receive payment for the Covered Shares under the Merger
Agreement.

  



  

4.5 _Further Assurances_. In addition to _Section 4.3_ , during the
term of this Agreement, from time to time, at Parent's request and without

applicable Law the Trust's and Mr. Jonas' identity and ownership of the
Covered Shares and the nature of the Trust's and Mr. Jonas' obligations under
this Agreement; _provided_ , that in advance of any such announcement or
disclosure, the Trust and Mr. Jonas shall each be afforded a reasonable
opportunity to review and approve (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) such announcement or disclosure. Each of the Trust and Mr. Jonas
agrees to notify Parent and the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable
of any required corrections with respect to any written information supplied

document. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or listing agreement

provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any
other jurisdiction.

  



  

5.8 _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither
this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall
be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement
is void. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors
and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement.

the following steps to be  completed as soon as practicable and no later than
45 days following the date of the Settlement Agreement (the _Closing Date_ ):

 



 

1. IDT  to pay Straight Path (including on behalf of its subsidiaries) $16 million in cash, comprised of (i) $10 million (along with the  Contingent Payment Rights described below) as a settlement of claims asserted against IDT by Straight Path and (ii) $6 million  in cash in exchange for the Current Patent Portfolio (described below);

 



 

2. All  shareholders of Straight Path IP Group, Inc. ( _Existing SPIP_ ) to transfer all of their Existing SPIP shares to a newly formed  Delaware corporation ( _New SPIP_ ) in exchange for identical New SPIP shares, followed by a conversion of Existing SPIP to  a Delaware limited liability company ( _SPIP LLC_ ). Following the conversion, (i) the equity capital structure of SPIP LLC  to be recapitalized to include the Contingent Payment Right (as described below), and (ii) SPIP LLC to transfer to New SPIP those  assets and liabilities not utilized in connection with the Current Patent Portfolio (described below) and the assertion of rights  in connection therewith (SPIP LLC to be a disregarded entity and then taxable as a partnership);

 



 

3. New  SPIP to transfer the Contingent Payment Right to Straight Path in redemption of a corresponding amount of New SPIP shares held  by Straight Path;

 



 

4. Straight  Path to transfer its remaining New SPIP shares to IDT (or a designee or assignee of IDT);

 



 

5. Straight  Path and IDT to execute mutual general releases of claims, including but not limited to indemnification claims relating to any  FCC investigation or consent decree, class action, derivative action or any other claim, threatened or otherwise, known or unknown,  arising from any action by the other party, its affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders, officers or directors; _provided_   that such release does not release either partys obligations under the Tax Separation Agreement between IDT and Straight Path,  dated July 31, 2013.

above to be reported as a tax-free contribution to capital by IDT to Straight
Path effective prior to the spin-off. 

---|--- 
  



    

  



  

     1  | NTD: This settlement structure is subject to tax review and
satisfactory completion of due diligence on the IP claims.

 | Ex B-1| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



     Straight Path IP Group:  |  

IDT and SPIP LLC agree to use commercially reasonable  efforts to assert all
patent rights, including all ownership, license, or other rights in the
patents held by SPIP LLC at the Effective  Time (the _Current Patent
Portfolio_ ).

 



 

IDT, its affiliate, subsidiary, or assignee to agree  to provide $20 million
in cash or services to SPIP LLC (directly or through New SPIP) to be used for
prosecuting and asserting  the Current Patent Portfolio, except if the
relevant patents or claims are held to be invalid or the lawsuits may not be
asserted  in a commercially reasonable manner. No more than $5 million of
services shall be provided directly by IDT employees or executives  without
the approval by the Trust (described below), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

SPIP LLC (and any successor) to have the sole purpose  of holding, defending
and prosecuting the Current Patent Portfolio (and making the payments
described herein).

 



 

SPIP LLC shall not, and IDT shall not cause SPIP LLC  to, sell, transfer or
assign all or any part of SPIP LLC\'s interest in the Current Patent Portfolio
to any IDT affiliate or subsidiary,  or to any person who is a director,
officer or employee of IDT or any of its affiliates and subsidiaries, or where
such transaction  would otherwise constitute a related party transaction,
unless (i) the Trust consents to the proposed sale, transfer or assignment, 
or (ii) the Current Patent Portfolio remains subject to the Contingent Payment
Right.

 


 
---|--- 
   Contingent Payment Right:  |  

A membership interest in the SPIP LLC which is entitled  to distributions of
any revenue with respect to the Current Patent Portfolio reasonably promptly
following the receipt of such  revenue equal to 22% of any Net Recovery. For
the sake of clarity, in the event of a sale or assignment of IDTs interest in
New  SPIP or SPIP LLC, the proceeds of such sale or assignment shall belong
entirely to IDT, and the parties hereto have no Contingent  Payment Right
with respect to such proceeds.

 



 

_Net Recovery_ means all revenue received by SPIP  LLC as the result of any
license, transfer, or assignment of any part of the Current Patent Portfolio,
or any settlement, award,  or judgment involving any part of the Current
Patent Portfolio, less out-of-pocket third party fees, expenses and costs
actually  incurred by SPIP LLC or IDT, and the reasonable services provided
by IDT its employees or executives, after the Effective Date  (including any
payment made to law firms and other vendors following the Effective Date
regardless of when those payments were  earned) in patent prosecution or
patent litigation (if any) related to the settlement award or judgment
resulting in such revenue,  including but not limited to any attorneys fees,
consultant or court costs, fees of experts and other costs and expenses
related  to the assertion of the patent rights.

 



 

Net Recovery to be subject to verification through an audit procedure, not to
be exercised more than once per year (the cost of which shall be paid by the
Trust). 

  



  

   

 | Ex B-2| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



     Trust:2  |  

Straight Path to form a trust (the _Trust_ ) and  transfer the Contingent
Payment Right to such trust in exchange for a single class of beneficial
interests in such trust. If the  independent directors of Straight Path
immediately prior to the Effective Time are not the initial trustees of such
trust, any  replacement trustees must be third parties who had no involvement
whatsoever in resolving the disputes underlying this settlement  agreement
and must be approved by IDT, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

 



 

The trust interests will be non-transferable and non-assignable,  in whole or
in part. The interests will not be registered as securities under the U.S.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 



 

Straight Path to fund the trust in the amount of $4.5  million to pay all
expenses of the trust, including administration expenses, compensation, fees
and expenses of the trustees, indemnification  amounts, insurance premiums,
and fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants and other experts retained by,
or at the direction  of, the trustees. IDT to have no responsibility for any
expenses of the trust.

 



 

The trust is intended to be classified as a grantor  trust for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

 


 
---|--- 
   Distribution to Straight Path Stockholders:  | Straight Path to
distribute the trust interests to Straight Path stockholders as a special
dividend prior to the Closing Date. 
     | 
   Right to Assign:  |  

IDT may assign its rights and interest to an affiliate  or a third party,
except it cannot assign its rights to a defendant in one of its IP lawsuits
without the Trusts consent unless  the funds paid in respect of such transfer
are included as revenue in the calculation of Net Recovery for purposes of the
Contingent  Payment Right.

 


 
   Final Agreement:  | This Term Sheet is intended by the parties to be an
outline of the terms for certain matters to be entered into between the
parties after signing. It is intended that such terms shall be incorporated
into the Settlement Agreement signed by the parties. Additional terms and
conditions may also be agreed upon in the Settlement Agreement. If for any
reason more definitive documents have not been signed by the parties prior to
the Closing Date set forth in any Merger Agreement into which Straight Path
enters, this Term Sheet shall be the final and binding agreement with respect
to the matters addressed herein. This term sheet supersedes the term sheet
entered into by the parties on April 6, 2017.

FORM OF COMPANY 
 CERTIFICATE

  



  

Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP

  

767 Fifth Avenue

  

New York, New York 10153

  



   | Re:| Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of [ ],
by and among ATandT Inc., a Delaware corporation, ("Parent"), Switchback Merger
Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and Straight Path Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Straight Path"). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In connection with the opinion to be delivered by Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP
pursuant to Section 6.3(c) of the Agreement (the "Tax Opinion"), and
recognizing that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP will rely on this certificate in
delivering such opinion, Straight Path hereby certifies, after due
inquiry and investigation, that the following statements and representations
are, to the extent relating to Straight Path (and to the extent otherwise
without reason to believe to the contrary), true, correct, and complete as of
the date hereof and will continue to be true, correct, and complete as of the
Effective Time,1 and thereafter where relevant:

  



   | 1.| Straight Path has no outstanding equity interests other than the
Shares, Company Options, Warrants and Company Restricted Stock. At the
Effective Time, Straight Path will not have outstanding any warrants, options,
convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which,
following the Merger, any person could acquire an interest in Straight Path
(or any successor of Straight Path). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| The consideration to be issued in the Merger to the stockholders
of Straight Path was determined on the basis of arm's-length negotiation
among the parties. The fair market value of the Per Share Merger Consideration
and any other consideration to be received by each stockholder of Straight
Path will be approximately equal to the fair market value of each Share
surrendered in the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  

    



  

  



  

    

1 Any capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning given to
such term in the Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all "Section"
references herein are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
all "Treas. Reg. §" references are to the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder.

   

   

 | Ex C-1| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



   | 3.| In the Merger, all Shares will be exchanged solely for Parent
Shares. For purposes of this representation, Shares redeemed or exchanged for
cash or other property provided, directly or indirectly, by Parent will be
treated as outstanding Shares at the Effective Time and as acquired by
Parent. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| Prior to and in connection with, or in contemplation of, the
Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part, no
outstanding Shares have been or will be (i) redeemed by Straight Path, (ii)
acquired by a person related to Straight Path (within the meaning of Treas.
Reg. § 1.368-1(e)(4)) (a "Straight Path Related Person") or (iii) the
subject of any distribution by Straight Path that is treated as other
property or money received in the Merger for purposes of Section 356 or would
be so treated if the holder of Shares also received stock of Parent in
exchange for such stock of Straight Path, other than possibly the
distributions pursuant to the IP Group Sale and Trust Distribution. Neither
Straight Path nor any Straight Path Related Person has paid or will pay, in
connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger
is a part, any amount to, or on behalf of, any stockholder of Straight Path
in connection with any sale, redemption or other disposition of any Shares or
Parent Shares. For purposes of this representation and representation 17: (i)
any reference to Straight Path or Parent includes a reference to any
successor or predecessor of such corporation, except that Straight Path is not
treated as a predecessor of Parent and Parent is not treated as a successor
of Straight Path; (ii) each partner of a partnership will be treated as
owning or acquiring any stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the
partnership (and as having paid any consideration paid by the partnership to
acquire such stock) in accordance with that partner's interest in the
partnership; and (iii) an acquisition of Parent Shares or Shares by a person
acting as an intermediary for, or pursuant to any transaction, agreement,
arrangement or other understanding with, Parent, Straight Path, a Parent
Related Person (defined below) or a Straight Path Related Person will be
treated as made by Parent, Straight Path, such Parent Related Person or such
Straight Path Related Person, respectively. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.| In connection with the Merger, Straight Path has not sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of any of its assets as would prevent
Parent or members of its qualified group (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §
1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) from continuing the "historic business" of Straight Path
or using a "significant portion" of Straight Path's "historic business
assets" in a business, as such terms are used in Treas. Reg. § 1.368-1(d),
after the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | Ex C-2| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



   | 6.| After the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will hold (i) at least
90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent
of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Straight Path immediately
prior to the Merger and (ii) to the knowledge of Straight Path, at least 90
percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of
the fair market value of the gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, the following
amounts will be treated as assets of Straight Path or Merger Sub, as
applicable, held immediately prior to the Merger: amounts (i) used (or to be
used) by Straight Path or Merger Sub to pay Merger expenses, (ii) paid (or to
be paid) by Straight Path or Merger Sub to redeem stock, securities,
warrants, or options of Straight Path as part of any overall plan of which the
Merger is a part, (iii) used (or to be used) to repay debt, other than any
debt that is refinanced in connection with the Merger, and (iv) distributed
(or to be distributed) by Straight Path or Merger Sub to the stockholders of
Straight Path (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall
plan of which the Merger is a part, including for this purpose, distributions
pursuant to the IP Group Sale and Trust Distribution. Neither Straight Path
nor, to the knowledge of Straight Path, Merger Sub, has disposed of any
assets prior to the Merger which disposition was made in contemplation of, or
as part of, the Merger, other than possibly the distributions pursuant to the
IP Group Sale and Trust Distribution. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.| The sale of stock of [New SPIP] pursuant to the IP Group Sale and
Trust Distribution was for consideration approximately equal to the fair
market value of such stock. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.| Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, Parent, Straight
Path, Merger Sub and the stockholders of Straight Path will pay their
respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.| Straight Path is not (A) an investment company as defined in
Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) or (B) under the jurisdiction of a court
in a title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 10.| There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent
(or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), on the one hand, and
Straight Path (or any of its subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was
issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 11.| In the Merger, no liabilities of the Straight Path stockholders
will be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub, nor to the best of the knowledge of
the management of Straight Path will any Shares be subject to any liabilities. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.| On the date of the Merger, the fair market value of the assets of
Straight Path will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of
liabilities, if any, to which its assets are subject. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.| The liabilities of Straight Path and the liabilities to which its
assets are subject were incurred by Straight Path in the ordinary course of
its business and are associated with the assets transferred. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | Ex C-3| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



   | 14.| None of the compensation to be received by any stockholder-
employee or stockholder-consultant of Straight Path will be
separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of such person's Shares; and
none of the Parent Shares to be received by any stockholder-employee or
stockholder-consultant of Straight Path in the Merger will be separate
consideration for, or allocable to, any past or future services. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.| The Merger is being effected for bona fide business reasons, as
described in the Form S-4 filed in connection with the Merger, including the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus contained therein as a prospectus, and not for the
purposes of tax avoidance. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 16.| The information relating to the Merger and all related
transactions (including, but not limited to, all representations,
warranties, covenants and undertakings) set forth in the Agreement and the
Form S-4 filed in connection with the Merger, including the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus contained therein as a prospectus, insofar as such
information relates to Straight Path, or the plans or intentions of Straight
Path set forth in the Agreement or the Form S-4 (including the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), is true, correct and complete in all material
respects. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.| The Agreement represents the full and complete agreement between
Straight Path, Parent and Merger Sub regarding the Merger, and there are no
other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger other than those
expressly referred to in the Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 18.| To the Knowledge of Straight Path, in connection with or in
contemplation of the Merger, no Shares will be acquired by Parent, any person
related to Parent (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.368-1(e)(4) (a
"Parent Related Person")) or any person acting as agent or intermediary for
any of them for any consideration other than the Merger Consideration. To
the Knowledge of Straight Path, neither Parent nor any Parent Related Person
has any plan, intention, obligation, agreement or understanding to, and will
not in connection with the Merger, directly or indirectly redeem, repurchase
or otherwise acquire any of the Parent Shares issued to Straight Path
stockholders in the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 19.| To the Knowledge of Straight Path, no holder of Shares acted as
an agent for Parent in connection with the Merger or approval thereof. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.| Straight Path will report the Merger for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and will not take a position on any federal, state or local income
or franchise tax return, or take any other reporting position, that is
inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a), unless otherwise required by a final
"determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)(1)), or by applicable state or
local income or franchise tax law. Straight Path has no plan or intention to
take, or cause or permit its subsidiaries to take, any action that would be
reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
under Section 368(a). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 21.| Straight Path is a corporation within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(3). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 22.| The individual executing this letter is authorized to make all of
the representations set forth herein on behalf of Straight Path. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Straight Path understands that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, as special counsel
to Straight Path, has not undertaken to verify independently, and has not
verified, the facts providing the basis of this letter, nor has such firm
been asked to do so. The undersigned recognizes that the Tax Opinion will be
based on the representations set forth herein and on the statements contained
in the Agreement and documents related thereto. The Tax Opinion will be
subject to certain limitations and qualifications, including that they may not
be relied upon if any such representations or statements are not accurate in
all respects. Straight Path will promptly inform you in writing if, at or
prior to the Effective Time, any of such statements or representations become
untrue or incorrect.

Shares. For purposes of this  representation, Shares redeemed or exchanged

and the removal of the board  of directors of Parent.

consultant  of Straight Path in the Merger will be separate consideration
for, or allocable to, any  past or future services; and the compensation to
be paid to any stockholder-employee  or stockholder-consultant after the
Merger will be for services actually rendered and  will be commensurate with
amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length  for similar

---|---|--- 
  



   | 19.| The  Merger is being effected for bona fide business reasons, as
described in the Form S-4  filed in connection with the Merger, including the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus contained  therein as a prospectus, and not for
the purposes of tax avoidance. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 20.| The  information relating to the Merger and all related
transactions (including, but not limited  to, all representations,
warranties, covenants and undertakings) set forth in the Agreement  and the
Form S-4 filed in connection with the Merger, including the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus  contained therein as a prospectus, insofar as such
information relates to Parent and  Merger Sub, or the plans or intentions of

material respects.

Sub to comply, with the record-keeping  and information filing requirements
of Treas. Reg. § 1.368-3. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 24.| Parent  will (and will cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to) report the Merger for  U.S. federal income tax purposes, and
will not take, and will cause Merger not to take,  any position on any
federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any  other
reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as
a  reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a), unless otherwise
required by a final  "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)(1)) or by
applicable state  or local income or franchise tax law. Parent has no plan or
intention to take, or cause  or permit its subsidiaries to take, any action
that would be reasonably likely to prevent  the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a).

following the Merger) or business operations.
