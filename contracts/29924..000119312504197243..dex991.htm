by Buyer shall be fully vested and be subject to, and exercisable upon, the
same terms and conditions as under the applicable Company Stock Plans and the
   applicable option and other related agreements issued thereunder, except
that each assumed Company Stock Option shall be exercisable (x) for shares of
Buyer Common Stock, with the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option by a
fraction (the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the
Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price
of Buyer Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the five trading
days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, (y) at an exercise price per share of Buyer Common
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable
pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (B) the Option Exchange
Ratio. Following the assumption of the Company Stock Options, all references
to the Company in the Company Stock Options and the Company Stock Plans shall
be deemed to refer to the Buyer.



(ii) Each Company Stock Option subject to the Pinnacor 2000 Equity Plan and
outstanding as of the Effective Time (a " _Pinnacor 2000 Option_ "), may, if
the holder so consents, to the extent of each such Pinnacor 2000 Option, be
assumed in accordance with _Section 2.4(f)(i)_ , above. Each Pinnacor 2000
Option to the extent not assumed pursuant to preceding sentence shall be
cancelled in consideration of payment to the holder thereof of an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
for each share of Company Common Stock under such Pinnacor 2000 Option subject
to withholding for applicable income, employment and other taxes. All payments
under this _Section 2.4(f)(ii)_ shall be made as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.



(iii) The conversion of Company Stock Options provided for in _Section
2.4(f)(i)_ , with respect to any options that are intended to be "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in
a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.



(iv) With respect to each Company Stock Option that is held by a director of
the Company who is not an employee of the Company (other than any director
that continues as a director, officer, employee or consultant of the Buyer or
any Subsidiary of the Buyer after the Effective Time) as of the Effective
Time (a " _Director Stock Option_ "), Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company shall
take all actions necessary to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each such Director Stock Option then outstanding shall become vested
and exercisable with respect to one hundred percent (100%) of the shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Director Stock Option and shall be
cancelled in consideration of payment to the holder thereof of an amount
equal to the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price for
each share of Company Common Stock under such Director Stock Option subject to
withholding for applicable income, employment and other taxes. All payments
under this _Section 2.4(f)(iv)_ shall be made as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time.



(v) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer shall deliver to
each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option an appropriate notice
setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and such Company Stock
Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this _Section 2.4(f)_ after giving effect to the
Merger). Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of such assumed Company Stock Options pursuant to the terms set forth
in this _Section 2.4(f)_.



(vi) Each share of Company Common Stock subject to a restricted stock award
(a " _Restricted Stock Award_ ") outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be
converted pursuant to the Merger into the right to receive Merger
Consideration in the same manner as other shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Immediately after the
Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Award (which will then represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration) shall accelerate and become fully
vested.



(vii) The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of
the Company ESPP in order to (i) shorten the offering period under the Company
ESPP which includes the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the "
_Current Offering_ "), if applicable, such that the Current Offering shall
terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) prohibit any new
participants from entering the Company ESPP and prohibit any current
participant from increasing his or her payroll deductions or subscription
amount after the date hereof, and (iii) ensure that no offering periods under
the Company ESPP commence after the date hereof. Any purchase rights existing
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company ESPP to acquire
a share of Company Common Stock (" _ESPP Purchase Rights_ ") shall be
cancelled in consideration of payment to the holder thereof of an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the purchase price
payable by the holder to acquire such share pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP subject to withholding for applicable income and employment
taxes. At the Effective Time the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP. (g) _Dissenting Shares_.



(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has demanded and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or
lost such appraisal rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ , but the holder thereof shall only be entitled
to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. 



(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) above, if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands purchase of such shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights, then, as of the later
of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the occurrence of such event, such holders
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.4_ , without
interest thereon, upon surrender to the Company of the Company Stock
Certificate.



(iii) The Company shall give Buyer (A) prompt notice of its receipt of any
written demands for appraisal rights and any withdrawals of such demands, and
(B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer or as may
be required under Applicable Law, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any demands for purchase of Company Common Stock pursuant to appraisal
rights or offer to settle or settle any such demands.



(h) _Conversion of Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At and as of the Effective
Time, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
shall be converted into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.



Section 2.5 _Procedure for Payment_.



(a) _Deposit of Funds_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to furnish to a bank or trust company
mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") a corpus
(the " _Payment Fund_ ") consisting of cash sufficient in the aggregate for
the Paying Agent to make full payment of the Merger Consideration to the
holders of all of the outstanding Company Common Stock (other than any
Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Common Stock held by Buyer, the
Company or Merger Sub). Buyer shall, from time to time, deposit any
additional funds necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration.



(b) _Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing
such customary provisions as Buyer and the Company may reasonably specify
(including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the
Paying Agent, provisions regarding those Company Stock Certificates held in
book-entry form) to each record holder of Company Common Stock outstanding at
the Effective Time for the holder to use in surrendering the Company Stock
Certificate against payment of the Merger Consideration. No interest will
accrue or be paid to the holder of any outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock. Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to make full payment of the Merger
Consideration to each holder of Company Common Stock (other than any
Dissenting Shares and shares of Company Common Stock held by Buyer, the
Company or Merger Sub) promptly after such stockholder surrenders
such stockholders Company Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent or an
affidavit to the effect that their Company Stock Certificates shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed in accordance with _Section 2.7_ to the Paying
Agent. In the event of a transfer of ownership of the Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
Company Stock Certificate surrendered is registered, if such certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such payment establish to the satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that the prior transfer was valid and such person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Company Stock
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Buyer or the Paying Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.



(c) _Investment of Payment Fund_. Buyer may cause the Paying Agent to invest
the cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Buyer; _provided,
however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable or the timing of payments of the Merger Consideration and that the
terms and conditions of the investments shall be such as to permit the Paying
Agent to make    prompt payment of the Merger Consideration as necessary. Buyer may cause the
Paying Agent to pay over to the Surviving Corporation any net earnings
with respect to the investments, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to replace promptly any portion of the Payment Fund that the
Paying Agent loses through investments.



(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Buyer may cause the Paying Agent to pay
over to the Surviving Corporation any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any earnings thereon) remaining 180 days after the Effective Time, and
thereafter all former stockholders of the Company shall be entitled to look to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat, and other
similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the cash payable
upon surrender of their Company Stock Certificates.



(e) _Paying Agent Expenses_. Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent.



Section 2.6 _No Further Transfers of Company Common Stock_. Following the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.



Section 2.7 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company
Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Buyer shall pay
the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof; _provided_ , that Buyer may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates to provide an indemnity or
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Buyer with respect to the Company Stock
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



Section 2.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of either the Company or Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.



ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



The Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer, except as set forth
in the Company SEC Reports (excluding any forward-looking statements
disclosed in such Company SEC Reports) or the Companys Disclosure Letter, as
follows:



Section 3.1 _Due Organization_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other organization duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization except in the
case of the Subsidiaries where the failure to be so organized and existing or
in such good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is
not reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has the corporate or similar power and authority
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to own all of its
properties and assets, except where the failure to have such corporate power,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and is not reasonably likely to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company in effect on the date
hereof have been provided or made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof.
Each of the Company and the Significant Subsidiary is duly qualified as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under lease
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had, and is not reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and the Significant Subsidiary have all business licenses,
permits and approvals necessary to conduct their business as presently
conducted, except where the failure to have such licenses, permits or
approvals, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and is not
reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Companys
only Significant Subsidiary is Hulbert Financial Digest, Inc., a Virginia
corporation. The other direct or indirect Subsidiaries of the Company do not
have any material assets and do not have any material liabilities which
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.2 _Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock.



(b) As of November 11, 2004, (w) 26,120,722 shares of Company Common Stock
were issued and outstanding, (x) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were
issued or outstanding, (y) Company Stock Options to acquire 4,841,258 shares
of Company Common Stock (at a weighted exercise price of $9.02) were
outstanding, and (z) 453,227 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and
available for issuance under the Company ESPP. All outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable.



(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Companys Disclosure Letter lists each Tranche of
Company Stock Options outstanding as of November 11, 2004, setting forth, with
respect to each such Tranche of Company Stock Options, the grant date, the
expiration date, the exercise price applicable thereto, the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject thereto and the Company Stock Plan under which
such Tranche of Company Stock Options was granted and the vesting schedule
thereof.



(d) The number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be issued under the
Company ESPP between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time plus
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that participants in the Company
ESPP will be entitled to purchase pursuant to the ESPP Purchase Rights
existing immediately prior to the Effective Time will not exceed 61,911 in
the aggregate. No shares of Company Common Stock will be issued under the
Company ESPP between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time at a
purchase price less than $6.81 per share. The purchase price per share of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the ESPP Purchase Rights existing
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be no less than $6.81.



(e) Since November 11, 2004, through the date hereof, the Company has not
issued any shares of its capital stock (except upon the exercise of the
Company Stock Options) or granted any Company Stock Options.



(f) Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and all such shares are owned by the Company, in each case, free and clear of
all material Liens, except where the failure to be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable or free and clear material Liens,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and is not reasonably likely to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 



(g) Except as set forth in _Sections 3.2(a)_ and  _(b)_ above, there are no
outstanding options, warrants or other outstanding rights of any kind which
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any shares of
capital stock or voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any securities or obligations convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for
or into any shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Other than the Company Employee Plans, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any stock appreciation,
phantom stock plans or other similar arrangements. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds, debentures or notes the holders
of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable for or into securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter. There are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or
the shares of any of its Subsidiaries.



Section 3.3 _Due Authorization of Transaction; Binding Obligation_.



(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, except that the
Companys ability to consummate the Merger is subject to obtaining the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Companys
stockholders, and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company (other than the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Companys stockholders for the consummation of
the Merger). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer and Merger Sub, this Agreement is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to the qualification, however, that
enforcement of the rights and remedies created hereby is subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar laws of general application relating to or    affecting creditors rights and to general principles of equity affecting
the availability of specific performance and other equitable remedies. 



(b) The board of directors of the Company has, by resolutions duly adopted at
a meeting duly called and held, (x) approved this Agreement, the Merger, and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and (y) subject to _Section 5.3_ of
this Agreement, recommended that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting.



(c) The only votes of the stockholders of the Company required to adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby are the affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock.



Section 3.4  _Non-Contravention_. Assuming compliance with the HSR Act and
any foreign or other antitrust or combination Laws, any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" Laws and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not: (i) contravene the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or the organizational
documents of the Significant Subsidiary; (ii) conflict with or violate any
Applicable Law; (iii) conflict with, result in a breach of or a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under any Contract; (iv) give rise to any right of termination, cancellation
or amendment under, or accelerate any Contract; (v) result in the creation of
any Lien on any of the properties or assets of the Company or the
Significant Subsidiary pursuant to any Contract; or (vi) conflict with any
judgment, decree, order or ruling to which the Company or the Significant
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective assets or properties
is bound, except in the case of clauses (ii) through (vi), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or results that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.5 _Government Approvals, Consents and Filings_. Except pursuant to
the HSR Act, any foreign or other antitrust or combination Laws, the Exchange
Act and any applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws, and the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, no approval, authorization, consent, order, filing, registration
or notification is required to be obtained by the Company from, or made or
given by the Company to, any Governmental Authority or any other Person in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company, except for such approvals, authorizations, consents, orders,
filings, registrations or notifications of which the failure to obtain,
individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.6 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Companys
Disclosure Letter, there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened against the Company or the Significant Subsidiary
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of the executive officers of the
Company, except, in each case, for those that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor the Significant Subsidiary
nor any of their respective properties is subject to any order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree or award, except for those that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no formal SEC inquiries or
investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company with respect to SEC
or other governmental inquiries or investigations, threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting or disclosure practices of the Company or the
Significant Subsidiary.



Section 3.7 _Brokers  Fees_. Except for fees payable to UBS Securities LLC
(formerly UBS Warburg LLC) (" _UBS_ "), the Company has no liability or
obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Buyer or
Merger Sub could become liable or obligated.



Section 3.8 _Filings and Reports; Financial Information_.



(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, all reports, forms,
statements, certifications and other documents required to be filed or
furnished with or to the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder since December 31, 2002
(all such reports and amendments and supplements thereto, collectively, the "
_Company SEC Reports_ "). As of the date filed or furnished (or if
subsequently amended, as of the date of such amendment), each of the Company
SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act,    as applicable. None of the Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates
(or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such amendment or superseding filing),
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets (including the related
notes) included in the Company SEC Reports fairly presented the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
thereof, and the other related financial statements (including the related
notes) included therein fairly presented the consolidated results of
operations and the changes in cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the respective periods set forth therein and such financial statements
were prepared in conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as otherwise noted therein and subject, in the case of the
unaudited interim financial statements, to (i) normal year end adjustments,
and (ii) the permitted exclusion of all footnotes that would otherwise be
required by GAAP.



(b) The Company has (x) designed and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of the Company by others within
those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of
directors of the Company (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. A summary of any of those disclosures made by management
to the Companys auditors and audit committee has been made available to
Buyer.



Section 3.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since September 30, 2004,
the Company has not:



(a) Other than with respect to this Agreement, incurred any material
liability or entered into any material transaction, except in the ordinary
course of its business consistent with past practices; or



(b) suffered any change in its business, assets, financial condition or
results of operation except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



Section 3.10 _Taxes_. (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has duly
and timely filed with the appropriate Tax authorities or other Governmental
Authorities all federal and state income or franchise Tax Returns and any
other material Tax Returns that it was required to file. All such Tax Returns
are complete and accurate in all material respects. The unpaid Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the dates of the financial
statements contained in the most recent Company SEC Reports, exceed the
reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes) reflected
on such financial statements. Since the date of the financial statements in
the most recent Company SEC Reports, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course
of business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.



(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has, within the time and in the
manner prescribed by applicable Law, withheld and paid over all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid over in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or
other third party.



(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any waivers or
extensions of any applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
material Tax Return.



(d) No claim is pending by a Taxing Authority of any jurisdiction in which the
Company or its Subsidiaries do not file a Tax Return that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries are or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.



(e) There is no material claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation now pending or, to the Knowledge of Company, threatened against
or with respect to Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax
or assessment.



(f) As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate net operating losses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes were not
less than $164 million. (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, at any time
during the period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A) of the Code, a United
States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)
of the Code.



(h) The Company has delivered to Buyer complete and correct copies of all
federal and all other material Tax Returns for tax years 2001-2003.

 



(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of
any consolidated group of corporations other than a group the common parent of
which is the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) has any liability for
the Taxes of a Person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) under
Treas. Reg. 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign
law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.



(j) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in (i) any
transaction for which IRS Form 8275 was filed or (ii) any
reportable transactions (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b)).



Section 3.11 _Employee Matters_.



(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Companys Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of each material Company Employee Plan as of the date hereof.
Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor the Significant Subsidiary has any commitment to
create any additional employee benefit plan or modify or change any existing
Company Employee Plan that would materially increase the cost to the Company
or such Significant Subsidiary of any Company Employee Plan.



(b) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than coverage mandated
by applicable law; benefits, the full cost of which is borne by the retiree;
or such promises and provisions that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



(c) The Company has complied with ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations
applicable to the Company Employee Plans and each Company Employee Plan
has been maintained and administered in compliance with its terms, except for
such non-compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or
are not reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(d) Except as has not had, or is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) no
Company Employee Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code; (ii) neither the Company nor the Significant Subsidiary has incurred any
material liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in
full; and (iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that
presents a risk to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of incurring any
such material liability.



(e) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, no actions, suits or
claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, except for actions,
suits or claims that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, or are
not reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(f) of the Companys Disclosure
Letter, the execution and delivery of, the performance by the Company of its
obligations under, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement, will not result in any payment, acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any employee of the Company or the Significant
Subsidiary (except as may otherwise be required by Applicable Law).



(g) The Company is not obligated to make gross-up payments or otherwise
indemnify any employee for excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the
Code. Section 3.12 _Material Contracts_.

done so, promptly request, to the extent it has a contractual right to do so,
that each person, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within
the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with its
consideration of any Alternative Transaction to return or destroy all
confidential information or data heretofore furnished to any person by or on
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries. 



(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
filing with the SEC a current report on Form 8-K to report the execution of
this Agreement and file a copy of this Agreement and any ancillary agreement
as exhibits to such a report.



Section 5.4 _Conduct of Business by Buyer and Merger Sub Pending the Merger_.
During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, Buyer and
Merger Sub shall not engage in any action or enter into any transaction or
permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered into that could
reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of, or otherwise adversely
affect, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, acquire (whether via merger,
consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire,
any material amounts of assets of or any equity in any Person or any business
or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not (a) impose
any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of
any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination
of any waiting period under Applicable Law, or (b) increase the risk of
any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of
the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise.

approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger. The Stockholder
Meeting shall be held as soon as practicable following the date upon which the
Proxy Statement becomes effective, and the Company will, through its board of
   directors, but subject to the fiduciary obligations of its board of
directors, (i) recommend to its stockholders the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) not rescind its authorization or approval
of this Agreement and the Merger.



Section 6.2 _Proxy Statement_.



(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable a
preliminary Proxy Statement and shall use commercially reasonable
best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
practicable after responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the
SEC staff. The Company shall notify Buyer promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will supply Buyer with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger.
If at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting there shall occur any event
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment
or supplement.



(b) Buyer shall furnish the Company with all information concerning Buyer
required for use in the Proxy Statement, and Buyer shall take such other
action as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, including any amendments or supplements
thereto. Buyer shall vote or cause to be voted by proxy or otherwise all
shares of Company Common Stock held or voting of which is controlled by,
directly or indirectly, by Buyer or Merger Sub for the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the Merger.



(c) The Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer and Merger Sub that
the Proxy Statement (x) when filed with the SEC, (y) when mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, and (z) at the date of the Stockholder Meeting
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and (ii) shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to information
that has been or will be supplied by Buyer or Merger Sub, or any of their
respective Representatives, specifically for use in the Proxy Statement.



Section 6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.



(a) Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other Representatives of Buyer, reasonable access at normal business
hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records. The Company shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Buyer all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Buyer may reasonably request, and shall
make available to Buyer the appropriate individuals (including attorneys,
accountants and other professionals) for discussion of its business,
properties and personnel as Buyer may reasonably request. Buyer shall keep
such information confidential in accordance with the terms of the letter
agreement, entered into on September 8, 2004 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") between Buyer and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not be required to provide access to any
information, property or personnel if (X) the Company believes in good faith
that such access is subject to any confidentiality obligations or would be
reasonably likely to jeopardize the Companys attorney-client, work product or
similar legal privilege; (Y) any Applicable Law requires the Company to
restrict or prohibit access to any such information, properties or personnel;
or (Z) such access would unreasonably disrupt the businesses and operations of
the Company; _provided_ that the Company will use commercially reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute access to information arrangements
under circumstances where the foregoing restrictions apply.



(b) No investigation pursuant to receipt of information or access to property
or personnel in accordance with _Section 6.3(a)_ above shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto or any condition to the
Merger. Section 6.4 _Consents; Approvals_.



(a) The Company and Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate with one another and
shall each use their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain (and
shall each refrain from taking any willful action that would impede obtaining)
all consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders needed to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company
shall not be required to make any payments to third parties other than
Governmental Authorities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each party shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to file the
premerger notification report, and all other documents to be filed in
connection therewith, required by the HSR Act and the premerger notification
rules promulgated thereunder with the United States Federal Trade Commission
and the United States Department of Justice as soon as practicable following
the date hereof, but in any event within five Business Days following the date
hereof. Each party shall respond promptly to any request for additional
information that may be issued by either Federal Trade Commission or
Department of Justice and shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
assure that the waiting period required by the HSR Act has expired or been
terminated prior to the date that is 30 days after such filing.



(b) Except where prohibited by Applicable Law, and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, each party shall coordinate with one another in
preparing and exchanging such information, and shall promptly provide the
other (or its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or
submissions made by such party with any Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer and
the Company shall make all necessary filings with Governmental Authorities,
including the SEC.



Section 6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions
to closing set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ and _7.3(a)_ , as the case may be,
shall not be met, and (ii) any failure of the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub,
as the case may be, to materially comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such
that the conditions to closing set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ and  _7.3(b)_ ,
as the case may be, shall not be met; _provided, however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice;
and _further provided_ that failure to give such notice shall not be treated
as a breach of covenant for the purposes of _Section 7.2(b)_ or _7.3(b)_
unless the failure to give such notice results in material prejudice to
the other party. No disclosure by any party pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ ,
however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the disclosures set forth on
Companys Disclosure Letter or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach
of warranty or breach of covenant.



Section 6.6 _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in the case of the Company further subject to the
fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors, each of the parties
hereto shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain in a
timely manner all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings, and to otherwise satisfy or cause to be
satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement.



Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Buyer and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release, or making any public announcement
or filing with a Governmental Authority, with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release, or make any such public
statement or filing without the prior consent of the other party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided, however_ , that a party
may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release,
or make such public statement or filing as may upon the advice of counsel be
required by Law or a Governmental Authority if it has used commercially
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party.



Section 6.8 _Conveyance Taxes_. Buyer and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications, or other documents regarding any Taxes, or any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees, that become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and that are required or permitted to be
filed on or before the Effective Time. Section 6.9 _Director and Officer Liability_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless (and make advances for
expenses as incurred to) the present and former officers and directors of the
Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time to the extent provided under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws in effect on the date hereof.



(b) Buyer will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform any
indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its directors,
officers and employees in force as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.



(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause to
be maintained in effect the policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company for the benefit of those persons who
are covered by such policies at the date hereof or the Effective Time (or
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time on terms and conditions that are at least as beneficial to the
beneficiaries of the current policies and with reputable carriers having a
rating comparable to the Companys current carrier); _provided_ , that Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation shall first use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain a "tail" policy on substantially the same terms and
conditions for claims arising out of acts or conduct occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time and effective for claims asserted during the full six-year
period referred to above, and only if it is unable after exerting commercially
reasonable best efforts, to obtain such a "tail" policy, Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain such coverage from such
carriers in annual policies; _provided, further_ that in no event shall Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend on an annual basis (other
than in respect of any "tail" policies, provided that Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to expend more than 250 percent of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for its current directors and
officers liability insurance policies in order to obtain any "tail" policy)
in excess of 175 percent of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for such coverage; and, _provided, further_ , that if the annual premium for
such coverage exceeds such annual amount, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase a policy with the greatest coverage available for such 175
percent of the current annual premium.



(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are intended for the benefit of, and
may be enforced by, each Person entitled to indemnification under this 
_Section 6.9_ and shall be binding on Buyer and the Surviving Corporation and
its successors and assigns.



(e) In the event Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.9_.



Section 6.10 _Action by Buyer and Company s Boards_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the boards of directors of Buyer and the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to the Company Common Stock) and
any assumption of Company Stock Options as provided in _Section 2.4(f)_
resulting from the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company (and in the case of the
assumption of Company Stock Options, with respect to Buyer) to be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, such steps to be
taken in accordance with the SECs no-action letter dated January 12, 1999
addressed to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.



Section 6.11 _Employee Benefits_. 



(a) Immediately following the Effective Time, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain all compensation and benefit plans and
arrangements (including without limitation, base salary, commissions, vacation
benefits, retirement benefits, and bonus opportunities, severance and
similar arrangements for any person terminated) for employees of the Company
who continue employment with Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary thereof after the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
that are no less favorable (excluding stock option, stock purchase or other
equity-based compensation arrangements) than those provided by the Company to
the Continuing Employees as of the Effective Time (the " _Initial Benefits_
"). As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but, in any event,
within one year following the Effective Time), Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide to the Continuing Employees, in lieu of the
Initial Benefits, compensation and    benefit plans and arrangements (including, without limitation, base salary,
commissions, vacation benefits, retirement benefits and bonus
opportunities, severance or similar arrangements) that are substantially
comparable to the compensation and benefit plans and arrangements provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Surviving Corporation) (the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.11_ , any employee who becomes
disabled while covered under the Company Employee Plans shall not become
eligible to be covered under the Buyer Benefit Plans unless and until he or
she ceases to be disabled and returns to active employment. For purposes of
the Initial Benefits and Buyer Benefit Plans listed on _Section 6.11_ of the
Buyers Disclosure Letter, Buyer shall give each Continuing Employee past
service credit for service with the Company prior to the Effective Time as if
it were service with Buyer. At, and after, the Effective Time, Buyer shall
honor, or cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their
terms and bear any cost associated with all employee benefit obligations to
current and former employees of the Company accrued as of the Effective Time.
To the extent benefits are not provided to Continuing Employees through the
applicable Company Employee Plans but are provided through other employee
benefit plans, Buyer agrees to, or cause the Surviving Corporation to, (A)
secure the waiver of any preexisting condition limitations, waiting periods,
or actively-at-work requirements imposed by such plans; and (B) cause such
plans to honor any expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their
beneficiaries under similar plans of Company during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the Effective Time for the purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, co-payment, and maximum out-of-pocket expenses under
such plans. Buyer agrees that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall be
responsible for providing all legally-mandated continuation coverage for
Continuing Employees and their covered dependents who experience a loss of
coverage due to a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of Section 603 of
ERISA and Section 4975B of the Code) that occurs at any time on or after the
Effective Time. 



(b) Buyer will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the
severance payments and benefits accrued or payable as of the Effective Time
under the plans and agreements with respect to the employees of the Company,
on the terms of such plans and agreements as in effect as of the Effective
Time. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a "change of
control" of the Company for purposes of such plans and agreements, and agrees
to honor the provisions under such plans and agreements relating to a change
of control.



(c) Nothing in this _Section 6.11_ is intended to create any employment
obligation other than as employees at will who may be terminated with or
without cause.



Section 6.12 _Form S-8_. Buyer agrees to file with the SEC as soon
as practicable but no later than 20 days following the Effective Time a
registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering, to the
extent applicable, the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued upon the
exercise of Company Stock Options assumed by Buyer. Buyer agrees to cause
shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of Company Stock
Options assumed by Buyer to be authorized for listing on the national
securities exchange on which the Buyer Common Stock is listed.



Section 6.13 _No Solicitation of Employees Prior to Close_. Except to the
extent permitted by the proviso to Section 18 of the Confidentiality
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company or Buyer, as the
case may be, prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor
Buyer, directly or indirectly, shall solicit for employment, discuss
potential employment opportunities with such party with, or hire any employee
of the other party, _provided_ , that neither the Confidentiality Agreement
nor the foregoing restriction shall prevent (i) Buyer from discussing with
the executive officers of the Company the employment of any employee by Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation in connection with consummation of the Merger,
(ii) Buyer from employing any Company employee upon the consummation of this
Merger, or (iii) either party from making general solicitations for employment
or employing any person who either responds to such general solicitations or
otherwise contacts such party on his or her own initiative without
solicitation by such party in contravention of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 6.13_.



Section 6.14 _No Acquisition of Shares_.



Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries shall acquire beneficial ownership
of any shares of Company Common Stock prior to the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time.



Section 6.15  _Merger Sub_.



Buyer shall cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Section 6.16 _Taxes_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall prepare and file,
or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed on or
before the Effective Time. All such Tax Returns will be consistent with past
practice, and will be true, correct and complete when filed. None of the
Company or its Subsidiaries shall (i) make or change any material Tax
election; (ii) without the consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, file any amended income tax or other material Tax
Return (iii) extend or waive any statute of limitations with respect to any
material Taxes; or (iv) settle or compromise any material Tax liability. At
least seven days prior to Closing, the Company shall furnish to Buyer a list
of all states in which there is a material net operating loss carryforward
into tax year 2004, and a schedule showing the estimated amounts of all such
net operating loss carryforwards as well as the expiration date of such loss
carryforwards (determined without regard to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). 



Section 6.17 _Determination of Net Operating Losses Carryforward_. The
Company has engaged the firm of Gardner, Corton and Douglas LLP to undertake a
S382 study of the availability of the Companys net operating losses. The
Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
study is completed and a copy promptly delivered to Buyer.

Section 8.2  _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto or any of
its affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders; _provided, however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 8.2_ shall relieve any party from liability for
breach of this Agreement or for fees and expenses as set forth in _Section
8.3_ , and that  _Sections 6.7_ , _8.2_ and _8.3_ and _Article IX_ shall
survive indefinitely any termination of this Agreement.



Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , (i) if the Merger is not
consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, or (ii) if the Merger is consummated, then the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all such fees and expenses.



(b) The Company shall pay Buyer a fee of $9,278,000 in cash (the " _Fee_ ")
in addition to any Buyer Expenses (as defined in _Section 8.3(c)_ hereof) that
are payable or have been paid to Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ hereof,
upon the earliest to occur of the following events: 



(i) the termination by Buyer or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ if
(1) (x) an Alternative Transaction has been publicly proposed to the Company
or its stockholders at or prior to the Stockholder Meeting (an " _Alternative
Proposal_ "), or (y) any Third Party shall have publicly announced an
intention to make an Alternative Proposal with respect to the Company at or    prior to the Stockholder Meeting, and (2) _either_ : (A) such proposed
Alternative Transaction has not been absolutely and unconditionally withdrawn
or abandoned by such Third Party (unless the board of directors of the
Company publicly announces that it unconditionally rejects such Alternative
Proposal) prior to the Stockholder Meeting, or (B) notwithstanding the
withdrawal of such Alternative Transaction or the rejection of the
Alternative Proposal) by the board of directors of the Company as provided in
the foregoing clause (A), this Agreement is terminated and an agreement for
such Alternative Transaction is entered into or such Alternative Transaction
is consummated within six (6) months after the date of such termination (
_provided_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ , all references
to 25% in the definition of "Alternative Transaction" shall be deemed to be
50%); or



(ii) The termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_
; or



(iii) The termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_.



(c) Upon the termination by Buyer or the Company, as applicable, pursuant to
(i) _Section 8.1(e)_ , (ii) _Section 8.1(f)_ , or (iii) _Section 8.1(g)_ ,
the Company shall pay Buyer (in addition to the Fee, if payable) an amount
equal to reasonable actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses (not in excess of
an aggregate of $1,500,000) that Buyer has incurred and is expected to incur
after such termination in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Buyer Expenses_ "), and which amount shall represent
the entire amount that Buyer is entitled to receive with respect to such
expenses, including, but not limited to, fees and expenses of Buyers
counsel, accountants and financial advisors.



(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Sections
8.3(b)_ and _8.3(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that the damages resulting from the termination of this
Agreement as referred to in _Sections 83(b)_ and _8.3(c)_ are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to 
_Sections 8.3(b)_ and _8.3(c)_ are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages
which may be incurred by Buyer under such circumstances, that the amounts
payable pursuant to _Sections 8.3(b)_ and _8.3(c)_ hereof
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and further that, without
these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this Agreement.



(e) If Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ , to the
extent applicable, (x) the Fee shall be paid within two (2) business
days after the termination of the Agreement, and (y) the Buyer Expenses shall
be paid promptly following the receipt by the Company of an invoice from Buyer
setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail, accompanied by reasonable
documentation. 



(f) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(f)_ ,
to the extent applicable, (x) the Fee shall be paid on the date of the
termination of this Agreement and (y) the Buyer Expenses shall be paid
promptly following the receipt by the Company of any invoice from Buyer
setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail, accompanied by reasonable
documentation.



(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the Fee payable
pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(i)_ shall be paid on the date an agreement for an
Alternative Transaction is entered into. ARTICLE IX

the courts of the State of California, County of San Francisco, or, if it has
or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the
