Parent and (2) the difference between insurance proceeds entitled to be
received by the Company from any lost rent insurance policy with respect to
the affected Company Property and the aggregate amount of rent lost due
to the casualty, (J) the Capex Adjustment, and (K) the Spring Village Promote
Amount. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in good faith by the Company
and in accordance with the principles, policies and practices set forth on
_Section 2.1(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, which includes an
illustrative projection of the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration as of the
Initial Estimated Closing Date (the " _Illustrative Projected Aggregate Cash
Merger Consideration_ "). To the extent that the Company and Parent are
unable to agree to the Estimated Closing Date at least fifteen (15) business
days prior to the Calculation Date, then the Company shall deliver, not less
than ten (10) business days prior to the Calculation Date, draft Closing
Statements based on (a) the Company's proposed Estimated Closing Date (which
shall be based on the date on which the Company reasonably believes all
conditions to consummation of the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ will be
satisfied), (b) Parent's proposed Estimated Closing Date (which shall be
based on the date on which Parent reasonably believes all conditions to
consummation of the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ will be satisfied) and
(c) the date that is the midpoint of the Parties' proposed Estimated Closing
Dates. In the event that the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration as determined
pursuant to the draft Closing Statement prepared based on Parent's proposed
Estimated Closing Date is more than $1 million less than the Aggregate Cash
Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to the draft Closing Statement
prepared based on the Company's proposed Estimated Closing Date, the parties
shall submit both draft Closing Statements to the Arbitrator in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_ for the Arbitrator to determine which proposed
Estimated Closing Date is more reasonable given the remaining conditions to
the Closing required to be satisfied under _Article VII_ ; provided, however,
if the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to the
draft Closing Statement prepared based on Parent's proposed Estimated Closing
Date is $1 million or less than the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration as
determined pursuant to the draft Closing Statement prepared based on
the Company's proposed Estimated Closing Date, the parties shall use the date
that is the midpoint of the Parties' proposed Estimated Closing Dates for
purposes of the Closing Statement.

(ii) The Company shall in good faith consult with Parent with respect
to the preparation of the Closing Statement (or in the event of
a disagreement as to the Estimated Closing Date, the Closing Statements), and
Parent and its Representatives shall have reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books, records and officers of the Company to the extent
reasonably required in connection with their review of the Closing Statement
(or in the event of a disagreement as to the Estimated Closing Date, the
Closing Statements) and the components thereof.

  



  

(iii) If Parent in good faith disagrees with any of the adjustments or
calculations set forth on the Closing Statement, it shall provide a notice to
the Company within three business day after Parent's receipt of the Closing
Statement setting forth the items with which it disagrees with reasonably
detailed support in respect of such disagreement (the " _Parent Objection
Notice_ "). If (A) the Parties are, after using their respective good faith
efforts, unable to reach agreement on all such items within two (2) business
days following receipt by the Company of a Parent Objection Notice and (B) the
aggregate amount in dispute as set forth in the Parent Objection Notice is
greater than $1,000,000, or if Parent and the Company were unable to agree
upon the Estimated Closing Date pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ , then Parent
and the Company shall immediately cause Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Arbitrator_
") to promptly review this Agreement and the disputed line items in the
Closing Statement for the purpose of resolving such dispute or disputes (for
the avoidance of doubt, if the Estimated Closing date is mutually agreed
but the disputed amount is less than $1,000,000, the amounts set in the
Closing Statement shall be deemed final if the Parties fail to otherwise
agree within such two (2)-business day period). In reviewing the Closing
Statement (or in the event of a dispute as to the Estimated Closing Date,
each Closing Statement), the Arbitrator shall apply the same principles,
policies and practices set forth on _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and used in the preparation of the Illustrative
Projected Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration. In performing its review, the
Arbitrator shall (A) apply only the provisions of this _Section 2.1_
(including the review standard set forth in the preceding sentence), (B)
determine the accurate application of such provisions to only those line
items in the Closing Statement as to which Parent has disagreed and which
Parent and the Company have been subsequently unable to reach agreement, (C)
limit the scope of its determination to the appropriate amount for each of the
previously unresolved line items in the Parent Objection Notice, and shall
make a final determination in writing, binding on the Parties, of the
appropriate amount with respect to each such line item by selecting in its
entirety either the position initially submitted to the Arbitrator by the
Company or the position initially submitted to the Arbitrator by the Parent
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_  that the Arbitrator believes, taking
into account the review standard, is, or is closest to, the most accurate
calculation with respect to such disputed line item and (D) if applicable,
select the Estimated Closing Date proposed by Parent or the Company based on
which date is closer to the most reasonable estimation of when the Closing
Date could occur, considering only the remaining conditions to the
obligations of the parties to effect the Closing in _Article VII_. The
Arbitrator shall adopt in its entirety the position of the Company or Parent
on each disputed line item or proposed Estimated Closing Date (as applicable)
and shall not choose any other figure for any such disputed line item or any
other date but, for the avoidance of doubt, the Arbitrator may adopt one
Party's position on some disputed line items and the other Party's position on
other disputed line items but must adopt one party's proposal as to the
Estimated Closing Date. The Arbitrator shall be required to deliver to Parent
and the Company, as promptly as practicable, but no later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the Arbitrator is engaged, a report setting forth its
resolution of the disputed line items and the selected Estimated Closing Date.
Parent and the Company shall promptly comply with all reasonable requests by
the Arbitrator for information, books, records and similar items. The Company
and Parent shall each be responsible for half of the fees of the Arbitrator.

(iv) If the Arbitrator is unable to resolve all disputed line items
set forth in the Parent Objection Notice or select the Estimated
Closing Date, as applicable, prior to the initial Calculation Date, the
Calculation Date and the Special Meeting shall be postponed for a period of
time sufficient to facilitate resolution of the remaining disputed line items,
but (a) each of Parent and the Company shall have five (5) calendar days
following engagement of the Arbitrator to submit materials supporting such
Party's position and (b) in any event the Calculation Date shall not be
postponed to a date more than thirty (30) calendar days following the
engagement of the Arbitrator, unless such day is not a business day, in which
case it will be postponed to the next succeeding business day. The Company
shall take all actions required to postpone the Special Meeting, including,
without limitation, as necessary, preparing and mailing a supplement to the
Proxy Statement. The Calculation Date and the Special Meeting shall not be
postponed on more than one occasion in order to facilitate the arbitration
provided for in this _Section 2.1_. In the event that the Arbitrator does not
reach resolution within the thirty (30) day period following its engagement,
any remaining disputed items on the Closing Statement shall be resolved in
favor of the position initially submitted by the Company and, if applicable,
the Closing Statement based on the midpoint of the Parties' proposed
Estimated Closing Dates shall be used; _provided that_ in the event a Party
fails to provide the supporting materials referenced in clause (a) above
within the five (5) calendar day period referenced in (a), the remaining
disputed items on the Closing Statement or the proposed Estimated Closing Date
shall be resolved in favor of the position submitted by the other Party.

Section 2.4 _Payment for Securities and Replaced Indebtedness;
Surrender of Certificates._

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(a) _Exchange Fund and Replaced Indebtedness Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a party reasonably
acceptable to the Stockholders' Representative to act as the payment agent in
connection with the Merger and the Redemption (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and
Phoenix Transfer, Inc. to act as the rights agent pursuant to the Contingent
Value Rights Agreement (the " _Rights Agent_ "). In addition, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall execute the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and designate
First American Title Company to act as the escrow agent pursuant to the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement (the " _Indemnity Escrow Agent_ "). Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
(i) with the Paying Agent cash (which shall include the Deposit Escrow
Amount, which shall be transferred to the Exchange Fund from the Deposit
Escrow Account) in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay
the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), (ii) with
the Indemnity Escrow Agent the Indemnity Escrow Amount in immediately
available funds (the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ "), (iii) with the
Title Company cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to
pay off the Replaced Indebtedness, if any (the " _Replaced Indebtedness Fund_
"), and (iv) with the Stockholders' Representative the Representative Amount
in immediately available funds, (A) $760,000 of which (the " _Representative
Fund_ ") will be used for pay for the expenses of the
Stockholders' Representative pursuant to _Section 9.16_ and (B) $240,000 of
which (the " _Representative Compensation_ ") will be retained by the
Stockholders' Representative for its own account as compensation for its
services as Stockholders' Representative. In addition, prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall pay or shall cause be paid to the
Company, to a Company Subsidiary or to an escrow agent as designated by the
Company (i) the Joint Venture Partner Purchase Amount and (ii) the Joint
Venture Indebtedness Amount. In the event the Exchange Fund or the Replaced
Indebtedness Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 2.2(a)_, _Section 2.2(b)_ or _Section 2.3_ or required to repay the
Replaced Indebtedness, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent or Title Company, as
applicable, in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Neither the Exchange Fund nor the Replaced
Indebtedness Fund shall be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided
for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent and the Replaced Indebtedness Fund shall be invested by Title
Company, in each case, as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_
that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1
or A-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment
or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares or holders of OP Series B Preferred Units pursuant to this
_Article II_ or the payment of the Replaced Indebtedness. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid in the case of the
Exchange Fund and the Replaced Indebtedness Fund, to the Surviving Entity on
the earlier of (i) one (1) year after the Effective Time or (ii) the full
payment of the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(b) _Contingent Value Rights_. At the Closing, Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative shall enter into the contingent value
rights agreement (the " _Contingent Value Rights Agreement_ ") with the
Rights Agent and Sentinel RE Investment Holdings LP in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit G_. After the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the Rights Agent to distribute the Contingent
Value Rights in accordance with this Agreement, the Contingent Value
Rights Agreement and the Merger Consideration Allocation Agreement. Parent
and the Company shall cooperate, including making changes to the form of
Contingent Value Rights Agreement, as necessary to ensure that the Contingent
Value Rights are not subject to registration under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws.

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Payoff of Replaced Indebtedness_. The Company will obtain and
deliver to Parent, on or prior to the date on which the Company delivers the
Closing Statement, payoff letters, together with wire instructions and any
other information or instruments necessary to effect payment of the Replaced
Indebtedness to a third party (which may reflect payment amounts calculated as
of a date other than the Closing Date, including per diem costs).
Concurrently with the Closing, the Parent shall instruct the Title Company to
cause to be paid to the applicable party, the Replaced Indebtedness pursuant
to the terms of such payoff letters.

  



  

(d) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than two (2) business days after the Effective
Time), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, cause the
Paying Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or
non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_
") and whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ or _Section
2.2(b)_ into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share
for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Entity, together with such letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration
for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share,
to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within five (5) business days following the later to
occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agent's receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share
so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept
such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment
that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Entity that such Tax either
has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_ , each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this _Article II_ , without interest thereon. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the (a) Paying Agent to pay the holder
of the OP Series B Preferred Units the Aggregate Cash OP Series B Preferred
Units Consideration to the account designated by such holder and (b) the
Rights Agent to issue to the holder of the OP Series B Preferred Units the
applicable number of Contingent Value Rights, each in accordance with the
Merger Consideration Allocation Agreement.

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. Following the
redemption of the OP Series B Preferred Units, the Company (as the General
Partner of the Company Operating Partnership) shall record the redemption in
the books of the Company Operating Partnership and the former holders of such
units shall cease to have any rights with respect to such units except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds
(including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the
Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is
pending subject only to the Paying Agent's routine administrative procedures,
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Entity and Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in _Section 2.4(d)_ , without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, Parent or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_
hereof.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Dissenter 's Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other
Transactions, including any remedy under Sections 3-201 et seq. of the MGCL
and the Company Board has not determined and will not determine prior to
the Effective Time that any such rights shall be available.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Withholding._  Any payments made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be net of all applicable withholding Taxes that Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Entity and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be
required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the applicable payor and
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



    

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.7 _Tax Treatment._ The Parties intend that for federal,
and applicable state, income tax purposes the Merger shall be treated as
a taxable sale by the Company of all of the Company's assets to Merger Sub in
exchange for the Common Merger Consideration, the Preferred Merger
Consideration and assumption of the Company's liabilities, followed by a
distribution of the Common Merger Consideration and the Preferred Merger
Consideration to the stockholders of the Company in liquidation pursuant to
Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is
hereby adopted as, a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Indemnity Escrow Fund._ The Indemnity Escrow Fund
shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any Lien,
attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of
any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement. The approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders
of the Company and the consent of the unit holders of the Company Operating
Partnership pursuant to the Merger Consideration Allocation Agreement
constitutes approval of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and of all of the
arrangements relating thereto, including the authority of the Stockholders'
Representative in accordance with _Section 9.16_.

each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing

aggregate, material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. The Company has delivered to or made available to Parent and Merger
Sub, prior to the execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of
the Organizational Documents, together with all amendments thereto, of each

has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and authority
to conduct its business as now being conducted, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good

Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice indicating that there is any material investigation of a Governmental
Entity pending or threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and
none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order,
writ, injunction, decree or arbitration ruling or judgment of a Governmental
Entity, in each case, which would, individually or in the aggregate, impair in
any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Merger Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement, as the case may be, or prevent the
consummation of any of the Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.5 _Information in the Proxy Statement._ None of the
information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliate or Representative
of Parent or Merger Sub, expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) will, at the date mailed to the Company's stockholders or
at the time of the meeting of the Company's stockholders to be held in
connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by any
other Person that is included in the Proxy Statement.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Ownership of Company Common Stock._ Neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor any of their respective affiliates is, nor at any time during
the last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company
as defined in Section 3-601 of the MGCL. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, any shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable for or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or any
securities of any Company Subsidiary and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any rights to acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, except pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a "Related Person" as defined in the Company
Certificate.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Financing Commitments._ Parent has delivered to the
Company a true, complete and correct copy of the debt commitment letter dated
as of the date hereof from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Capital One,
National Association (the " _Debt Financing Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant
to which the lender parties thereto have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to lend the amount set forth therein to Parent
and Merger Sub (the " _Debt Financing_ "). Parent has delivered to the
Company a true, complete and correct copy of the equity commitment letter,
dated as of the date hereof, from the Sponsor listed therein (the " _Equity
Financing Commitment Letter_ ," and together with the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the
Sponsor has committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,
to invest in Parent the cash amount set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ ", and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ ").
None of the Financing Commitments have been amended or modified prior to the
date of this Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the
Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.
There are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements that affect the
conditionality or amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company pursuant to the
first two sentences of this _Section 4.7_. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees or expenses in connection with the Financing
Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding
and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of
the other parties thereto, except as may be limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Financing Commitments. Parent is not aware of the occurrence
of any event which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments.
Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied. The
aggregate proceeds from the Financing will be sufficient for the Parent to (i)
satisfy its obligation to pay the Merger Consideration and to pay off the
Replaced Indebtedness, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be
paid by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by
the Financing, and (iii) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of
Parent contemplated hereunder and/or under the Financing Commitments.

Section 4.8 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub._ Parent owns
beneficially and of record all of the outstanding membership interests of
Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Transactions, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted
its operations only as contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.9 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Other than the Parent
Financial Advisor, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor, agent or
other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's,
agent's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Solvency._  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering
into this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to all of the
Transactions, including the payment of the Aggregate Cash Merger
Consideration, the deposit of the Indemnity Escrow Amount with the Indemnity
Escrow Agent and any other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be
contemplated, assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's
obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, or the waiver of
such conditions and (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Article III hereof (for such purposes, such
representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material
respects), and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Entity
will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 4.10, the term "Solvent" with
respect to the Surviving Entity means that, as of any date of determination,
(x) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the
sum of (i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other liabilities,
as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance
with the applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of
debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on
its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured; (y) the Surviving Entity will not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the business in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged by Parent following such date;
and (z) the Surviving Entity will be able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Parent and
Merger Sub has been provided access to personnel, properties, premises and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such purposes. In
entering into this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied solely
upon its independent investigation and analysis of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees that it has not been induced by and has not relied upon any
representations, warranties or statements, whether express or implied, made by

stockholders, unit holders, controlling persons or Company representatives
that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement, whether or not such
representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or orally.
Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that, without limiting any
of the express representations and warranties set forth in  _Article III_ ,

Competing Proposal and upon the request of Parent shall apprise Parent of the
status of such Competing Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.2_.

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.2(d)_ or _Section 5.2(e)_
, the Company Board shall not (i)(A) fail to recommend to its stockholders
that the Requisite Stockholder Approval be given or fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or in a manner adverse to Parent modify, the Company Board
Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other
than a recommendation against such offer or a temporary "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Competing Proposal
(actions described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any Competing Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iii) take any action pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the
time the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the
Company Board (or committee thereof) may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Competing Proposal, if and only if, prior to taking such
action, the Company Board (or committee thereof) has determined in good faith,
after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, as applicable, (x) that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable Law or the Company
Certificate and (y) that such Competing Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , that in connection with the
Competing Proposal of any Person (1) the Company has given Parent at least
four (4) business days' prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, (2) the Company has disclosed to Parent the material terms of such
Superior Proposal, (3) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (4) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good
faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent,
and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect and
(5) in the event of any material change to the material terms of such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described in sub clause (1) above
and the notice period shall have recommenced, except that the notice period
shall be at least one (1) business day; _provided, further_ that any
purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be
void and of no force and effect, unless the Company terminates this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 8.1_ and the Company pays Parent the applicable
Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.2(b)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the
time the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the
Company Board may change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or, in a manner adverse to
Parent, modify, the Company Board Recommendation (" _Change of Recommendation_
") if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would create a
material risk of a breach by the Company Board of its duties under applicable
Law and the Company Certificate.

  



  

(f) Except to the extent provided in _Section 5.2(c)_ or _Section
5.2(d)_ , nothing in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate
applicable Law or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, in either case, if the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
create a material risk of a breach by the Company Board of its duties under
applicable Law and the Company Certificate; _provided_ that any disclosures
(other than those made pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section 5.2(f)_ )
permitted under this _Section 5.2(f)_ that are not an express rejection of any
applicable Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company
Board Recommendation shall be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean
any proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to 20%
or more of the Company's consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the
Company's revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B)
acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or the OP
Common Units, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding
Company Common Stock or OP Common Units, (D) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or Company Operating Partnership or
(E) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the
percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and
Company Common Stock or OP Common Units involved is 20% or more; in each
case, other than the Transactions.

  



  

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean
any written Competing Proposal that the Company Board (or committee thereof)
has determined, after consulting with the Company's outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisors that if consummated, would reasonably be
likely to result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions (including
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response
to such proposal or otherwise); _provided_ that for purposes of the definition
of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition of
Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

  



  

Section 5.3 _Proxy Statement._ The Company shall, at its own cost
and expense, prepare and file with the SEC, subject to prior notice to
Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable ( _provided_ , that the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the preliminary Proxy
Statement to be filed within 30 days after the date hereof but in no event
later than 45 days after the date hereof), a preliminary Proxy Statement (the
"Preliminary Proxy Statement") relating to the Merger as required by
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company the information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to be
included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company (i) shall obtain and
furnish the information required to be included in the Preliminary Proxy
Statement, (ii) shall provide Parent with, and consult with Parent regarding,
the Proxy Statement, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its
staff with respect thereto and any other filings to be made with the SEC in
connection with this Agreement (other than with respect to any Competing
Proposal), (iii) shall respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement, (iv) shall consider in
good faith any comments reasonably proposed by Parent in the Proxy Statement,
any response to comments received from the SEC or its staff and any other
filings to be made with the SEC in connection with this Agreement (other than
with respect to any Competing Proposal), (v) shall cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Company's stockholders at the earliest reasonably
practicable date and (vi) shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to
Section 5.2) to obtain the necessary approval of the Merger by the Company's
stockholders. If, at any time prior to the Special Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
affiliates, this Agreement or the Transactions (including the Merger), should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be prepared by the Company and filed with the SEC, and
to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of
the Company.

Section 5.4 _Stockholder Approval._ The Company shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, in accordance
with applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents, establish a record
date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the initial purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Except
as specifically permitted by _Section 5.2_ , the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) shall continue to recommend that the Company's
stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.4_ , if, on a date
for which the Special Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock
to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Special Meeting solely for the purpose of
and for the times reasonably necessary to solicit additional proxies and
votes in favor of the Merger and the Transactions.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause to be given) any notices to
any Person, and each of Parent and the Company shall use, and cause each of
their respective affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consents from any Person not covered by _Section 6.2(a)_ that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Merger, including health care
regulatory approvals from applicable Governmental Entities to be obtained by
Parent and any waiting period expiration or termination as may be required
under the HSR Act. Each of the Parties will furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or
submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the other Party of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions
to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each other with copies of all
material correspondence, filings (other than any documents that are
responsive to Item 4(c) or Item 4(d) of the form required under the HSR Act),
or communications between either Party and any Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties
or their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each
of the Parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the
other and each of their affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger and the other Transactions, except that confidential competitively
sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchanges and the
parties are not required to share any documents that are responsive to Item
4(c) or Item 4(d) of the form required to be filed under the HSR Act. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall provide to
the other (or the other's respective advisors) upon request copies of all
correspondence between such Party and any Governmental Entity relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials
provided to the other under this _Section 6.2_ as "outside counsel only."
 Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the party providing such materials. To the extent
reasonably practicable, neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they
permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any
meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry
relating to the transactions described herein without giving the other Party
prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, without giving the other Party the opportunity to attend or
participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such
Governmental Entity.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than
any Governmental Entity) with respect to the Merger, none of the Company, any
of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives,
shall be obligated to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any
accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such
Person prior to the Effective Time. The Parties shall cooperate with respect
to accommodations that may be requested or appropriate to obtain
such consents. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it
is expressly understood and agreed that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
be under any obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out agreements,
enter into consent decrees or submit to any order providing for (A) the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets
of Parent or any of its affiliates or the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on the
ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to freely conduct their business
or own such assets, other than, in the case of clauses (A) or (B) above, for
any such sale, divestiture, license, disposition, holding separate,
limitation or regulation that would be immaterial to the Parent and/or the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Each of the
Company and Parent agrees to make, or cause its ultimate parent entity (as
that term is defined in the HSR Act) to make, an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act if required with respect
to the Transaction as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable additional information and
documentary material that may be reasonably requested pursuant to the HSR Act
and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions consistent with this _Section 6.2_  necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in _Article
VII_ , the obtaining any approval or consent from any Person pursuant to
this  _Section 6.2_ shall not be a condition to the obligations of the
Parties to consummate the Merger.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement
with respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation with
outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing
agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or
trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in which
event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to provide any such review or comment to Parent in connection with
the receipt and existence of a Competing Proposal and matters related thereto
or a Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _further_ , each Party and their
respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this
_Section 6.3_.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance and
Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company to the fullest extent
permissible under applicable Law, under the Company Governing Documents in
effect on the date hereof and under any indemnification or other similar
agreements in effect on the date hereof (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ")
to the individuals covered by such Company Governing Documents or
Indemnification Agreements (the " _Covered Persons_ ") arising out of or
relating to actions or omissions in their capacity or by reason of their
service, as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions.

  



    

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.4(a)_ , for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Entity to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
Covered Person against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out
of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission
in such Covered Person's capacity as such or by reason of such Covered
Person's service, or (B) this Agreement and any of the Transactions; and (ii)
pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys' fees) of any
Covered Person upon receipt, to the extent required by applicable Law, of an
unsecured and interest free undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Covered
Person is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this  _Section 6.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation of a Covered Person for which
indemnification may be sought under this _Section 6.4(b)_  unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of such Covered Person from all liability arising out of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation. In any event, Parent and Surviving
Entity shall timely notice all claims and circumstances under insurance that
may cover Covered Persons either directly or would cover advancement and
indemnification obligations owed to Covered Persons. Parent and Surviving
Entity shall cooperate with Covered Persons to effectively assert all claims
under such policies.

  



  

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of
the Surviving Entity shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered
Persons for periods prior to and including the Effective Time than are
currently set forth in the Company Governing Documents. The Indemnification
Agreements with Covered Persons that survive the Merger shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

  



  

(d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that
Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound
carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to
make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums
exceed 175% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company
for such insurance (such 175% amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided,
further_ , if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only
be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Base Premium, Parent shall
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Base Premium; _provided,
further_ , if the Company in its sole discretion elects, by giving written
notice to Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time,
then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, effective as of the Effective Time,
the Company shall purchase a directors' and officers' liability insurance
"tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time with respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or
allegedly committed at or prior to the Effective Time (such coverage shall
have an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount not
to exceed the annual aggregate coverage limit under the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability policy, and in all other respects shall be
comparable to such existing coverage).

(e) In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee
of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_.

  



  

(f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are
intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.4_ , and this
_Section 6.4_ shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered
Persons (including their successors and heirs) or terminated without the
consent of the Covered Persons (including their successors and heirs) affected
thereby.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes._ The Parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the
other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Obligations of Merger Sub._ Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities

sessions, and participating in reasonable and customary due diligence, (ii)

promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall facilitate
Parent's request for, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Parent's efforts to obtain the Recognition Agreements, SNDAs and
assignment and subordination of property management agreements
reasonably requested by Parent and its Debt Financing Sources; _provided,
however_ , that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would (i) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to pay any
commitment fee or other fee or payment to obtain consent or to incur any
other liability, (ii) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to authorize any corporate action prior to the Closing Date, (iii) require
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to waive or amend any terms of
this Agreement, or (iv) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries

any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided, further_ , that the Company
acknowledges and agrees that the Parent will be primarily responsible for and
lead all efforts to obtain all Recognition Agreements, SNDAs and assignment

Costs. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to cooperate, with all reasonable
requests of the Parent related to obtaining the Lender Consents;  _

to the extent it would (i) require the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to pay any assumption fee or other fee or payment or to incur any
other liability, (ii) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to authorize any corporate action prior to the Closing Date, (iii)
require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to waive or amend any

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_ ; or

(c) In addition, the Company agrees that if this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or by the Company or Parent

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the
Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement are not penalties, but rather are liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement is payable or the Company in the circumstances where the Parent
Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent's right to
receive payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement from the Company, as the case may be, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, unit holders managers, members, affiliates
or agents (the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for the losses or damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise. Upon payment of the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Company Related Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions, except with respect to any obligations that
survive a termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.2(a)_.

Company's right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent

partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents (the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") for damages or losses suffered as a result of the failure
of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise. Upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, none of
Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective Subsidiaries and any Parent
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except with respect to any
obligations that survive a termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.2(a)_ or any obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. In
the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee or
the Parent Expense Reimbursement when due or Parent shall fail to pay the
Parent Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
shall reimburse the Party due such payment for all reasonable costs
and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other Party (including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this _Section 8.2_. Further, if the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 8.2_ , and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Party owing such payment for the payment set forth in this
_Section 8.2_ , such paying Party shall pay the other Party its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

shall have any liability for any obligation or liability to the Company, any
of its affiliates or any of its or their direct or indirect stockholders for,
and, except for the Company, no Company Related Party shall have any
liability for any obligation or liability to Parent or Merger Sub, any of
their respective affiliates or any of their or their respective affiliates'
direct or indirect stockholders for, any claim for any loss suffered as a
result of any breach of this Agreement or the failure of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in
respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise;

(ii) The maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub
collectively, and the maximum aggregate liability of the Company, for
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement or the failure
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby to be
consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be
have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, shall be limited to, in the case of
Parent and Merger Sub, the Parent Termination Fee plus any interest, costs
and expenses payable in accordance therewith, and in the case of the
Company, the Company Termination Fee plus any interest, costs and expenses
payable in accordance therewith. In no event shall Parent, Merger Sub and the

consequential, indirect or punitive damages) in excess of such Parent
Termination Fee plus any interest, costs and expenses payable in accordance
therewith or such Company Termination Fee plus any interest, costs and

hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation
made or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith or therewith,
whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and in
such event, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall not seek to, and shall
cause their respective affiliates not to seek to, recover any money damages
(including consequential, indirect or punitive damages) or obtain any

Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure
Letter and each Exhibit or Annex attached hereto) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements

hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Tax Advice._ Neither Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective advisors, on the one hand, nor the Company or their respective

other regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger or any other Transaction, and

advisors in connection with this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Non-Recourse._  Subject to the rights of the parties
to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter under the terms thereof, none of the

whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

  



  

Section 9.16 _Stockholders ' Representative._

  



  

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the approval of this Agreement by
the Company's stockholders and the consent of the Company Operating
Partnership unit holders (the " _Represented Equityholders_ "), and without
further action of any Company stockholder, Company Operating Partnership unit
holder or other recipient of Aggregate Merger Consideration, each such
Represented Equityholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted and
appointed Sentio Investments, LLC (and by execution of this Agreement it
hereby accepts such appointment) as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "
_Stockholders ' Representative_") for and on behalf of the Represented
Equityholders (in their capacity as such), with full power of substitution, to
act in the name, place and stead of each such Represented Equityholder with
respect to the provisions of _Annex A,_ the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and
the Contingent Value Rights Agreement and the taking by the Stockholders'
Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by the Stockholders' Representative under
_Annex A,_ the Indemnity Escrow Agreement or the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement; _provided, however_ , the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to any unit holder or Company stockholder to the extent that they are
explicitly a party to the Contingent Value Rights Agreement;  _provided
further_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing appointment does not
apply in any respects to the Merger Consideration Allocation Agreement. The
power of attorney granted in this _Section 9.16(a)_ is coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable, may be delegated by the Stockholders'
Representative and shall survive the death or incapacity of any Represented
Equityholder or any other Person. Such agency may be changed by the holders
of a majority in interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund from time to time
(including in the event of the death, disability or other incapacity of the
Stockholders' Representative that is an individual), and any such successor
shall succeed the Stockholders' Representative as the Stockholders'
Representative hereunder. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders'
Representative, and the Stockholders' Representative shall receive no
compensation for its services, except for the Representative Compensation
(which the Stockholders' Representative will be entitled to retain for its
own account as compensation for its services).

  



    

 | 87| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)   _Limitation on Liability_. The Stockholders' Representative
shall not be liable to any Person for any act of the
Stockholders' Representative taken in good faith and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this
Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith),
except to the extent any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or
expense is actually incurred by such Person as a proximate result of the gross
negligence, or bad faith of the Stockholders' Representative. The
Representative Fund shall be available to indemnify and hold the
Stockholders' Representative harmless against any liability, loss, damage,
penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by the Stockholders' Representative
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties under this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement or the Contingent
Value Rights Agreement, except to the extent that any such liability, loss,
damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense is the proximate result of the gross
negligence, or bad faith of the Stockholders' Representative. The
Representative Fund shall be the Stockholders' Representative's sole recourse
for any such indemnified liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or
expense incurred. The Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to
recover any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Stockholders'
Representative in connection with actions taken by the
Stockholders' Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement or the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of legal
fees and costs) from the Representative Fund. The Representative Fund shall
be the Stockholders' Representative's sole recourse for any such out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred.

  



  

(c) _Access_. From and after the Effective Time, subject to any
applicable attorney-client privilege (after taking into consideration the
provisions of _Section 6.15_ ), Parent shall provide the Stockholders'
Representative with reasonable access to information about the Surviving
Entity, the Company Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary and
the reasonable assistance of the officers and employees of Parent, the
Surviving Entity, the Company Operating Partnership or any other Company
Subsidiary solely for the express purpose of performing its duties and
exercising its rights under this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and
the Contingent Value Rights Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Stockholders' Representative shall not unreasonably interfere with any of the
operations or business activities of Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Company
Operating Partnership and the other Company Subsidiaries.

  



    

 | 88| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Actions of the Stockholders ' Representative_. From and after
the Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to its appointment under _Section
9.16(a)_ shall constitute a decision of all of the Represented Equityholders
for which the Stockholders' Representative has authority to act under _Section
9.16(a)_ , and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Represented Equityholders for which the Stockholders' Representative has
authority to act under _Section 9.16(a)_ , and the Indemnity Escrow Agent and
Parent and their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors and assigns
may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders'
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
such Represented Equityholder. The Indemnity Escrow Agent, Parent and their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors and assigns shall be fully
protected in relying in good faith on any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders' Representative with respect to which (and to
the extent that) authority has been granted under _Section 9.16(a)_ and shall
not be obliged to make any inquiries into the authority of the Stockholders'
Representative.

  



  

(e) _Representative Fund_. The Stockholders' Representative shall
have the sole discretion to use the Representative Fund to pay any out-of-
pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in its
capacity as the Stockholders' Representative, including any attorneys',
accountants' and other experts' fees. Once the Stockholders' Representative
determines, in its discretion, that it will not incur any additional expenses
in its capacity as the Stockholders' Representative, it will deliver to the
Rights Agent the remaining unused portion of the Representative Fund (for
further distribution pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights Agreement). The
Parties agree that the Stockholder's Representative shall keep a detailed
and accurate accounting of the Representative Fund, including by keeping
substantiation for all deductions of the Representative Fund.

ANNEX A 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 1.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties._ The
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing and shall terminate at the end of the Indemnity Escrow Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a good faith written claim
for indemnification for breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or
warranty is made in compliance with the terms of this _Annex A_ prior to the
end of the Indemnity Escrow Period, such representation or warranty shall
survive, solely in relation to such claim, until such claim is resolved. If
Parent does not deliver such a written claim for indemnification prior to the
end of the Indemnity Escrow Period, then any associated right to
indemnification hereunder for such breach or inaccuracy shall terminate
at the end of the Indemnity Escrow Period.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Indemnification of the Parent Indemnified Parties._
Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Annex A_ , from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates (which, after the Effective Time,
shall include the Surviving Entity, the Company Operating Partnership and
each other Company Subsidiary) (each such Person, a " _Parent Indemnified
Party_ ") shall be indemnified solely from the Indemnity Escrow Fund for any
and all Losses, without duplication, based upon or arising from:

  



  

(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made by the Company pursuant to (i) _Article III_ of the Agreement or (ii)
the certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ of the
Agreement solely with respect to the representations and warranties contained
in _Article III_ of the Agreement, in each case, to the extent that such Loss
would be covered under the provisions of the RandW Insurance Policy but for the
requirement to satisfy the Retention Amount;

  



  

(b) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made by the Company pursuant to Article III of the Agreement arising after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time to the extent such Loss is
excluded pursuant to clause 2 of Section III of the RandW Insurance Policy
relating to interim breaches (as defined in the RandW Insurance Policy);

  



  

(c) any Legal Proceeding against the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in their
capacity as an officer or director, arising between the date hereof and
Closing to the extent such costs were not included in the calculation of the
Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration or are not covered by applicable
insurance;

  



  

(d) the Legal Proceedings set forth on Section A of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent such Legal Proceedings are not settled prior
to the Effective Time or is not covered by insurance;

  



    



 



    



  

(e) any fines or penalties imposed by Governmental Entities arising
from violations of HIPAA or Health Care Laws prior to the Closing Date by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; and

  



  

(f) any costs and expenses incurred in the marketing of the
partnership interests in Bryan MOB Partners, L.P. or the underlying real
property pursuant to _Section 6.22(c)_ ; and

  



  

(g) any of the matters set forth on Section B of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Additional Provisions Regarding Indemnification
Obligations._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the rights to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 1.2_ are subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(a) Any amounts payable to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this _Annex A_ shall be paid solely and exclusively from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, the right of any of the
Parent Indemnified Parties to be indemnified from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
pursuant to this _Annex A_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement. No
current or former direct or indirect stockholder of the Company or unit
holder of the Company Operating Partnership, or director, officer, employee,
affiliate or advisor of the Company, the Company Operating Partnership or
such stockholder or unit holder shall have any liability of any nature to
Parent or any of its affiliates with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy
in any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement or any other matter related to or arising therefrom.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in
this Annex A, the indemnification provided for in _Section 1.2_ shall not
apply except to the extent that the Losses against which the Parent
Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified under this
_Annex A_ for any individual indemnification claim exceeds $15,000 (the "
_Per-Claim Deductible_ "), in which event, for each such individual
indemnification claim, Parent shall, subject to the other limitations
contained herein, be entitled to be indemnified for the full amount of such
Losses from the first dollar. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an
individual claim for indemnification based upon the same act, event, omission,
circumstance, or set of facts shall be deemed a single individual claim to
which a single Per-Claim Deductible shall be applicable.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in
this _Annex A_ , the indemnification provided for in _Section 1.2_  shall not
apply except to the extent that the aggregate Losses against which the Parent
Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified under this
_Annex A_ exceeds $200,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the other limitations contained herein,
be entitled to be indemnified for the full amount of such Losses from the
first dollar.

  



    



 



    



  

(d) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in
this _Annex A_ , for purposes of computing the amount of any Losses incurred
by the Parent Indemnified Parties under this _Annex A_ , there shall be
deducted: (i) any Tax Benefits actually received by Parent or any of its
Affiliates on account of such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise
thereto, in each case within the year of such event; and (ii) an amount equal
to the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments,
contribution payments or reimbursements actually received by Parent or any of
its Affiliates (net of actual, out-of-pocket costs of enforcement) in
connection with such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto ("
_Third Party Payments_ "). Parent shall, and shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Third Party
Payments. If any Loss otherwise subject to indemnification hereunder is
covered under any property and casualty, errors and omissions or
other insurance in favor of Parent or its Affiliates, Parent shall, or shall
cause its applicable Affiliates to, make a claim for such Loss under such
insurance prior to, or concurrently with, making a claim for indemnification
hereunder. The calculation of Losses shall not include losses arising because
of a change in any applicable Law or accounting principle, in each case after
the Closing. If Parent or any of its Affiliates receives a Tax Benefit or
Third Party Payment that would have otherwise been deducted from a Loss under
the foregoing provisions after an indemnification payment is made pursuant to
this _Annex A_ , Parent shall promptly pay the amount thereof to the
Indemnity Escrow Agent (for deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement) or, if such amount is received after the end
of the Indemnity Escrow Period, Parent shall promptly pay such amount to the
Rights Agent (for further distribution pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement) at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit
or Third Party Payment is actually received by Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

  



  

(e) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in
this _Annex A_ , the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this _Annex A_ to the extent that the Losses giving rise
to the right to such indemnification have already been addressed through a
reduction in the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to an adjustment
made thereto under  _Section 2.1_.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
purposes of determining whether a breach of or an inaccuracy in a
representation or warranty has occurred, and calculating the amount of Losses
(including in connection with the Per-Claim Deductible and the
Deductible) incurred in connection therewith, any and all references to
"material" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" (or other similar or
correlative terms or qualifiers) shall be disregarded.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 1.4 _Indemnification Procedures; Third Party Claims._

  



  

(a) A Parent Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholders'
Representative prompt written notice of any matter which the
Parent Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (other than a Third Party
Claim), within twenty (20) business days of such determination (an "
_Indemnity Notice_ "), specifying with reasonable particularity (on the basis
of the information available) the factual basis for the Parent Indemnified
Party's right to indemnification hereunder and the amount of Losses included
in the Parent Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification, to the extent
known or estimable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give an
Indemnity Notice shall not waive a Parent Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification, except if, and then to the extent, the Stockholders'
Representative is prejudiced by the Parent Indemnified Party's failure to
give notice. Parent shall cooperate fully with the
Stockholders' Representative's review and contesting of such Indemnity
Notice. Such cooperation shall include the retention and the provision of
books, records and information that are reasonably relevant to any Indemnity
Notice and making available on a mutually convenient basis full access to all
relevant books, records, information and personnel of Parent reasonably
necessary for the Stockholders' Representative's review and/or contesting of
an Indemnity Notice. Parent will, and will cause the surviving entity and
the Company Subsidiaries to retain until the termination of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement all books, records and information pertinent to the
operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) If any claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand is brought by a
Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") against a Parent Indemnified Party, and if such party
intends to seek indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to this _Annex
A_ , such Parent Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in any event within
twenty (20) business days after the Parent Indemnified Party learns of the
existence of the Third Party Claim, notify the Stockholders' Representative
in writing of the Third Party Claim, specifying with reasonable particularity
(on the basis of the information available) the nature of such Third Party
Claim, the factual basis for the Parent Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification hereunder and the amount of Losses included in the Parent
Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification, to the extent known or
estimable;  _provided, however_ , that no delay on the part of the Parent
Indemnified Party in notifying the Stockholders' Representative will waive
the Parent Indemnified Party's right to indemnification, except to the extent
the Stockholders' Representative is prejudiced by the Parent Indemnified
Party's failure to give notice. The Parent Indemnified Party will deliver to
the Stockholders' Representative, promptly after the Parent Indemnified
Party's receipt thereof, copies of all court papers relating to the Third
Party Claim and notices and documents relating to the Third Party Claim
received by the Parent Indemnified Party.

  



    



 



    



  

(c) The Stockholders' Representative will have the right to
participate in or assume the defense of the Third Party Claim (in either case
at the expense of the Stockholders' Representative) with counsel of its
choice; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholders' Representative may
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim only so long as (i) the
Stockholders' Representative delivers written notice to the Parent
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim within twenty (20) business days of receipt of written notice of such
Third Party Claim from the Parent Indemnified Party; (ii) the Third Party
Claim would not reasonably be expected to result in injunctions or other
equitable remedies in respect of Parent or its business; and (iii) the Third
Party Claim would not reasonably be expected to result in criminal proceedings
in respect of Parent or its business. Should the Stockholders' Representative
so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Stockholders'
Representative shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnified Party for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Parent Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof. If the Stockholders' Representative is
conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with the
provisions above, the Parent Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and expense,
may retain separate counsel, and participate in the defense of the Third
Party Claim, it being understood that the Stockholders' Representative will
control such defense. If the Stockholders' Representative has not assumed the
defense of such Third Party Claim within twenty (20) business days of receipt
of written notice of such Third Party Claim, the Parent Indemnified Party will
(upon delivering written notice to such effect to the Stockholders'
Representative) have the right to undertake the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parent
Indemnified Parties in no event shall be entitled to reimbursement for more
than one counsel (plus any required local counsel) for all Parent Indemnified
Parties.

  



  

(d) Parent shall provide to the Stockholders' Representative, upon
its written request, documents and materials that are under the
Parent Indemnified Parties' control and that the Stockholders' Representative
reasonably considers necessary or desirable for the defense of a Third Party
Claim. Parent shall execute such documents and take such other actions,
including making its and its Affiliates' employees reasonably available
during normal business hours with reasonable advance written notice, as
the Stockholders' Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of
facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise or adjustment
relating to, a Third Party Claim. Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
shall otherwise fully cooperate as reasonably requested by the other party in
the defense of each Third Party Claim, including making available all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in such party's
possession or under its control relating thereto as is reasonably required by
the other party.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 1.4_ to the contrary,
neither the Stockholders' Representative nor the Parent Indemnified Party
shall, without the written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned), settle, compromise or
discharge any Third Party Claim or admit any liability or permit a default or
consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim;
_provided_ that if the Stockholders' Representative assumes the defense of
any Third Party Claim, the Stockholders' Representative may agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim without the
consent of the Parent Indemnified Party if (i) by its terms it unconditionally
releases the Parent Indemnified Party completely from all liability in
connection with such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not include an admission of
wrongdoing or misconduct by the Parent Indemnified Party, and (iv) does not
impose any injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Parent Indemnified Party.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 1.5 _Treatment of Payments to Holders of Contingent Value
Rights._ Any payments made to holders of Contingent Value Rights pursuant to
this Agreement and the Contingent Value Rights Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax, financial, reporting
and other purposes, to the extent permitted under applicable Law.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Exclusive Remedy._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, after the Closing, the remedies set
forth in this _Annex A_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Parent for
any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or
other provision contained in this Agreement by the Company or the Company
Operating Partnership (recoverable in accordance with the terms hereof). In
furtherance of the foregoing, Parent (on behalf of itself and its affiliates,
successors and assigns) hereby forever waives and releases (and covenants not
to sue with respect to), from and after the Closing, any and all claims
and rights of action it may have against the direct or indirect holders of
Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock or unit holders of the Company
Operating Partnership and their respective affiliates, successors, and
assigns, in each case under, relating to, or arising out of this Agreement.

A_ , the term:

Time and ending on the date that is thirty six (36) months thereafter.

with and without basis (comparing the actual cash Tax liability of Parent or
any Subsidiary thereof for such Tax year against the hypothetical cash
Tax liability of such Party had such Losses not been incurred).

  



    



 



    



  

Section 1.8 _Non-Recourse._  Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor or any
of their respective affiliates (including, from and after the Effective Time,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), shall have any rights or claims
against any stockholders, unit holders, officers or directors of the Company
or the Company Operating Partnership, or their respective affiliates, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement.
