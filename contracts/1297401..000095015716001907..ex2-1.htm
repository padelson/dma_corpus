State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and

Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation

SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers._ (a) The directors of Merger Sub

or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.07. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Company Common
Stock Held by Company Subsidiaries._ Each share of Company Common Stock that
is owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock held by
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall
be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation such that each such Company Subsidiary owns the same percentage of
the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Company Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Shares, but excluding
shares to be canceled or to be converted in accordance with Section 1.07(b)
and, except as provided in Section 1.07(d), Appraisal Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive $41.00 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 1.08, without interest.

  


 

  

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.07(c), but instead
shall be canceled and shall represent the right to receive only those rights
provided under Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to receive those
rights under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only
the right to receive, the Merger

  


 

     

4

 

  


 

  

Consideration as provided in Section 1.07(c), without interest. The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.08. _Payment of the Merger Consideration._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Class A Stock in
accordance with this Article I and, in connection therewith, shall enter into
an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent cash necessary to pay for the shares of Class A Stock converted
into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 1.07(c) and any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 5.04(a) to the former holders of Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, Company Performance Restricted Stock
Units, Company Restricted Shares and Company Stock Appreciation Rights, as
applicable, to the extent set forth in Section 5.04(c)(ii) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  


 

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure for Class A Stock._ As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after
the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Class A Stock (the " _Class A Certificates_ ") which were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07(c) (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Class A Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Class A Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable
to the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Class A Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Class A Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Class A Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash into which the shares of Class A Stock theretofore represented
by such Class A Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
1.07(c), and the Class A Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Class A Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Class A Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Class A Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Class A
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

  


 

     

5

 

  


 

  

Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.08, each Class A
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without
interest, into which the shares of Class A Stock theretofore represented by
such Class A Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 1.07(c). No
interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Class A Certificate.

  


 

  

(c) _Treatment of Book-Entry Shares._ As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to, with respect to each holder of record, as of the Effective Time, of
Book-Entry Shares of Class A Stock, mail a check, or make a wire transfer, in
an amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled hereunder.

  


 

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of Class A Stock
entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied
with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Class A
Certificate (or an affidavit in lieu thereof in accordance with Section
1.08(g)) has not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Class A Certificate would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration in respect of such Class A Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such date become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, subject to the claims of any former
holder of Class A Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has
not theretofore complied with this Article I.

  


 

  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall only be in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof with maturities of no
more than 30 days and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States, in commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
United States commercial banks with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on
the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly
available). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent. In no event, however, shall such investment or any
such payment of interest or income delay the receipt by former holders of
Class A Stock of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders'
rights hereunder. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund

  


 

     

6

 

  


 

  

diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to
promptly pay the Merger Consideration to all holders of Class A Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares of Class A Stock, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange
Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a
level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments.

  


 

  

(g) _Lost Class A Certificates._ If any Class A Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Class A Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Class A Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Class A
Certificate the Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(h) _Exchange Procedure for Class B Stock._ (i) As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Class B Stock (the " _Class B Certificates_" and, together with the Class A
Certificates, the " _Certificates_ ") which were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07(c) shall surrender
the Class B Certificates held by such holder to the Surviving Corporation,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Class B
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Class B Certificates to the
Surviving Corporation, and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Class B
Certificate to the Surviving Corporation for cancelation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the Surviving Corporation or Parent
shall promptly, and in any event no later than two business days after such
surrender, in exchange therefor make a wire transfer to an account designated
by the holder of such Class B Certificate in an amount of U.S. dollars equal
to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled hereunder, and the Class B Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.08(h), each
Class B Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Class B Stock theretofore represented
by such Class B Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 1.07(c).
No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger Consideration payable upon
surrender of any Class B Certificate.

  


 

  

(ii) On the Closing Date, immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall, with respect to each holder of record, as of the
Effective Time, of Book-Entry Shares of Class B Stock, (x) make a wire
transfer to an account designated by such holder in an amount of U.S. dollars
equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled hereunder.

(i) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article I as a result
of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock not in violation of the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. After the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article I.

  


 

  

(j) _Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  


 

  

(k) In the event that between the date of this Agreement and immediately prior
to the Effective Time, there is a change in the number of shares of Company
Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of
such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement.

misappropriates or otherwise violates, or has infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated any Intellectual Property of any Person or constitutes a
libel, slander or other defamation of any Person, except as would not

Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not received any written notice of,
and to the knowledge of the Company, there have been no threatened claims or
Proceedings alleging the matters described in the preceding sentence (or
challenging the ownership, validity or enforceability of any Owned
Intellectual Property) since January 1, 2015, nor are there any such claims
pending. To the knowledge of the Company, no third party is infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any material Owned Intellectual
Property in any material respect other than any infringement, misappropriation
or other violation that the Company has considered and made an affirmative
business decision not to pursue. There are no Proceedings pending in which the

infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Owned Intellectual
Property.

reasonable actions, consistent with current industry standards, to protect the

used by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and all information and data
stored or contained therein or transmitted thereby) against any material
unauthorized use, access, interruption, modification or corruption, including

response to a Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of

majority of the independent members thereof, determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor, constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal (a "
_Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal_ "), the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company to the Person making such Qualifying
Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement so long as the Company also provides Parent, prior
to or substantially concurrently with the time such information is provided or
made available to such Person, in accordance with the terms of the

or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to

  


 

     

37

 

  


 

  

approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to
take any such action (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) permit or cause
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement relating to any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
this Section 4.03), or publicly propose to take any such action.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, but subject to Section 4.03(f), if the Company
Board determines, by the affirmative vote of the majority of the independent
members thereof, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then (A) the Company Board, by the affirmative
vote of the majority of the independent members thereof, may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Company Proposal or an
Intervening Event, and (B) if the Company Board receives a Superior Company
Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f)
in accordance with Section 7.04(b).

  


 

  

(f) The Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) unless (A) the Company
shall have provided Parent with written notice at least three business days
before taking that action setting forth the Company's intention to take such
action and containing (x) if such action is intended to be taken in response
to a Superior Company Proposal, a copy of the most current version of the
proposed agreement under which the transaction contemplated by such Superior
Company Proposal is proposed to be consummated, a written description of the
financing arrangements with respect to the Superior Company Proposal, a
written description of the terms of any arrangements between the Person or
group of Persons making the Superior Company Proposal, on the one hand, and
any members of management of the Company, on the other hand, and the identity
of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior Company Proposal or (y)
if such action is intended to be taken in circumstances involving an
Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts
giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such action, and (B) Parent does
not make, within such three-business day period, a binding proposal to amend
or modify this Agreement that (1) in the case of any action intended to be
taken in response to a Superior Company Proposal, is in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, as determined by the affirmative vote of the
majority of the independent members thereof, at least as favorable to the
stockholders of the Company as such Superior Company Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Company Proposal shall require the Company to
deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (A) above, except that the applicable notice period shall be at least
two business days (rather than the three business days otherwise contemplated
by clause (A) above)), or (2) in the case of any action intended to be taken
in circumstances involving an Intervening Event, obviates the basis for taking
such action. During any such three- or two-business day period referred to in
the preceding sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, negotiate in good faith with Parent

  


 

     

38

 

  


 

  

(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to any revisions
proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions.

shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e‑2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board, by the affirmative vote of the majority of the independent members
thereof, determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties or applicable Law; _provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change
will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (it being
understood that (x) any "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act and (y) any disclosure of information to the Company's
stockholders that solely describes the Company's receipt of a Company Takeover
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains
a statement that the Company Board has not effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be deemed to not be an Adverse Recommendation Change).

from a financial point of view than the Transactions, taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and (B) that is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,

after the execution of this Agreement and in lieu of calling a meeting of the
Company's stockholders, the Company shall submit a form of irrevocable written
consent attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ to record holders of at least 51% of
the aggregate voting power of the Company Common Stock (such written consent,
as duly executed and delivered by all such record holders, the " _Stockholder
Consent_ "). As soon as practicable upon receipt of the Stockholder Consent by
the corporate secretary of the Company, the Company will provide Parent with a
facsimile of such Stockholder Consent, certified as true and complete by the
corporate secretary of the Company. In connection with the Stockholder
Consent, the Company shall take all actions necessary to comply, and shall
comply in all respects, with the DGCL, including Section 228 and Section 262
thereof, the Company Charter and the Company By-laws.

  


 

  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within 10 days of the date hereof), the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC a written information statement of the type contemplated by
Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act containing (i) the information specified in
Schedule 14C under the Exchange Act concerning the Stockholder Consent, the
Merger and the other

  


 

     

40

 

  


 

  

Transactions (such information statement, including any amendment or
supplement thereto, the " _Information Statement_ "), (ii) the notice of
action by written consent required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL and (iii) the
notice of availability of appraisal rights and related disclosure required by
Section 262 of the DGCL. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning such Person to the other as may be reasonably requested
in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Information
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Information Statement and shall provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Information
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the date that is 20
days after the Information Statement is first mailed to the Company's
stockholders, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  


 

  

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Information Statement to be (i) filed with the SEC in definitive form as
contemplated by Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and (ii) mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, in each case as promptly as practicable after,
and in any event within two days after, the latest of (A) confirmation from
the SEC that it has no further comments on the Information Statement, (B)
confirmation from the SEC that the Information Statement is otherwise not to
be reviewed or (C) expiration of the 10-day period after filing in the event
the SEC does not review the Information Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant
to this Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by any Adverse Recommendation
Change or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or any other Person of any Company Takeover
Proposal. In the event the Stockholder Consent is not obtained and Parent does
not terminate this Agreement, in each case, as provided in Section 7.01(g),
then the Company shall, as soon as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC
a proxy statement related to the Merger and this Agreement (such proxy
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") and shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of adopting
this Agreement and use its

  


 

     

41

 

  


 

  

reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Except if prohibited
by any applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (under the supervision of appropriate
personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) during
the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties,
books and records and Contracts and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, furnish, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with affording such access or furnishing any such
information shall be reimbursed by Parent. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall be required to afford access or furnish information to the extent (a)
such information is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party, (b) relating to the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board
or any committee thereof (including any presentations or other materials
prepared by or for the Company Board or any committee thereof) where the
Company Board or any such committee thereof discussed the Transactions or any
similar transaction between the Company and any other Person or (c) the
Company determines in good faith that affording such access or furnishing such
information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, violate applicable Law or result in
significant antitrust risk for the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , in the case of clauses (a) and (c), that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements to afford
such access or furnish such information without breaching such confidentiality
agreement, jeopardizing such attorney-client privilege, violating applicable
Law or resulting in such antitrust risk, as applicable. All information
exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be subject to the
confidentiality letter agreement dated April 15, 2016, between the Company and
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  


 

  

SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification._ (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the
other Transactions, including (i) substantially complying with a request for
additional documents or information under the HSR Act or any comparable
request from any other Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers and Consents from, the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings with and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid a Proceeding by any Governmental
Entity with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, (iii) the defending
or contesting of any Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of

  


 

     

42

 

  


 

  

any of the Transactions, including avoiding the entry of and seeking to have
any stay, injunction, temporary restraining order or other restraint entered
by any court or other Governmental Entity lifted, vacated or reversed and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to

Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

  


 

  

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation

48

 

  


 

  

program or any plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification._ (a) All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights to advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director or officer
(including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company
Charter, the Company By-laws, the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof
(i) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without
further action, at the Effective Time, (ii) shall survive the Merger, (iii)
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms with
respect to any claims against any such Indemnified Party arising out of such
acts or omissions and (iv) shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation
complies with and honors the foregoing obligations.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting Section 5.06(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time,
in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding, whether civil, criminal
or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was a director or officer (including as a fiduciary with respect to an
employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any
of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or the approval of, or recommendation that the holders of Company
Common Stock approve, any of the foregoing, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law or the organizational documents of the applicable indemnifying
Person), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection
with any such threatened or actual Proceeding. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any threatened or actual Proceeding for which indemnification
could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall at their own expense cooperate with
an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such

  


 

     

49

 

  


 

  

Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that,
absent an actual or potential conflict of interest, in which case such
Indemnified Party shall control and appoint its own lead counsel at Parent's
or the Surviving Corporation's expense, as applicable, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel
for such defense. Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under
this Section 5.06(b) shall continue in full force and effect for the six-year
period beginning upon the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

  


 

  

(c) The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of, or
recommendation that the holders of Company Common Stock approve, this
Agreement or the Transactions, and for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions) for the six-year period
beginning upon the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party and
containing terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts) and
conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are,
individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party
than those of the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO
Policies_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum aggregate annual
premium for such "tail" insurance policies for any such year shall not exceed
the maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by the second succeeding
sentence. If such "tail" insurance policies have been obtained by the Company,
Parent shall cause such "tail" insurance policies to be maintained in full
force and effect, for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by it and the Surviving Corporation. In the event the Company does
not obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then, for a period of six years
from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect the Existing DandO Policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the
annual premium payable by the Company for coverage for its current fiscal year
under the Existing DandO Policies (which amount the Company represents and
warrants is set forth in Section 5.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter);
_provided further_ that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain the most advantageous policy available for an annual premium equal to
such amount; and _provided further_ that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing
terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions
(including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually
and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other

  


 

     

50

 

  


 

  

Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.

  


 

  

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.06 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section
5.06 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which each
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.06.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.07. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as set forth in Section 5.02,
Section 5.06, this Section 5.07 and Section 5.09, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that:

  


 

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f);

  


 

  

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d); or

  


 

  

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a bona fide Company Takeover
Proposal is publicly proposed or announced, or the existence of a bona fide
Company Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement otherwise
becomes publicly known prior to the termination of this Agreement, (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated (1) by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the conditions set forth in
Section 6.01(b) and (c) have been satisfied or, if permitted by Law, waived)
or (2) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) and (C) within 12 months of such
termination either (x) the transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover
Proposal are consummated (but no definitive agreement is entered into by the
Company in connection therewith) or (y) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover
Proposal,

  


 

  

then the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $152,000,000 (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that, in the case of Section
5.07(b)(iii)(C)(y), only 50% of the Company Termination Fee shall be payable
upon the Company's entry into such definitive

  


 

     

51

 

  


 

  

agreement, and the remaining 50% of the Company Termination Fee shall become
payable if and only if the transactions contemplated by such definitive
agreement are subsequently consummated. For purposes of this Section 5.07(b),
the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 4.03(h), except that all references to (x) "20%" in clause
(i)(A) of such definition shall be deemed references to "50%" and (y) "20% or
more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock, or of any class of
capital stock, of the Company" in clause (i)(B) and clause (ii) of such
definition shall be deemed references to "50% or more of the aggregate voting
power, and 50% or more of the aggregate number of outstanding common shares,
of the capital stock of the Company." Any fee due under this Section 5.07(b)
shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by
Parent as follows: (1) in the case of Section 5.07(b)(i), the Company
Termination Fee shall be paid prior to or simultaneously with such termination
of this Agreement, (2) in the case of Section 5.07(b)(ii), the Company
Termination Fee shall be paid within two business days after the date of such
termination of this Agreement, (3) in the case of Section 5.07(b)(iii)(C)(x),
the Company Termination Fee shall be paid within two business days after the
date of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Company
Takeover Proposal and (4) in the case of Section 5.07(b)(iii)(C)(y), 50% of
the Company Termination Fee shall be paid within two business days after the
execution of such definitive agreement and the remaining 50% of the Company
Termination Fee, if payable pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of
Section 5.07(b), shall be paid within two business days after the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by such definitive agreement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the
Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different
events.

  


 

  

(c) Acceptance by Parent of the fee due under Section 5.07(b)(i) shall
constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination of this
Agreement under Section 7.01(f). Except in the case of common law fraud,
payment of the Company Termination Fee described in this Section 5.07 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective current, former or
future Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of the Company Termination
Fee, none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective current, former or future Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions.

  


 

  

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(ii) (solely in respect of
any Legal Restraint in respect of any Required Regulatory Approval) and, at
the time of such termination, all of the conditions set forth in (i) Section
6.01 (other than (A) Section 6.01(b) or (B) Section 6.01(c) solely in respect
of any Required Regulatory Approvals) and (ii) Section 6.02 have been

date of such termination), then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of
$200,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "). Any fee due under this
Section 5.07(d) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account
designated by the Company no later than two business days after the date of
the termination of this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

  


 

  

(e) Except in the case of common law fraud, in the event the Parent
Termination Fee is paid under the circumstances set forth in Section 5.07(d),
payment of the Parent Termination Fee described in this Section 5.07 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent and
Merger Sub and their respective current, former or future Representatives for
any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective current, former or future
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

  


 

  

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(g), then the Company shall pay Parent by wire transfer of same
day funds, as promptly as possible (but in any event within two business days)
following the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor, all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub
prior to such termination in connection with the Transactions.

  


 

  

(g) Parent and the Company each acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 5.07 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without
these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section
5.07 when due, as applicable, such fee shall accrue interest for the period
commencing on the date such fee becomes past due, at the publicly announced
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. In addition, (i) if the Company shall fail to pay
the Company Termination Fee when due, the Company shall also pay to Parent all
of Parent's costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with efforts to collect such Company Termination Fee and (ii) if
Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, Parent shall
also pay to the Company all of the Company's costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with efforts to collect such Parent
Termination Fee.

communications with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement or
broad-based employee communication prior to such consultation, except as may
be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange and except as
specifically permitted or required by Section 4.03. The parties agree that the

initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be

documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by either Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger
Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect
to such Transfer Taxes.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.10. _Stockholder Litigation._ Prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VII, the Company shall promptly advise
Parent of any commenced or threatened stockholder Proceeding of which the
Company is aware against the Company or its directors relating to any
Transaction and shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably informed regarding
any such stockholder Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any such stockholder Proceeding
and shall give due consideration to Parent's views with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall control the defense of such
Proceeding and this Section 5.10 shall not give Parent the right to direct
such defense; and _provided_ _further_ , that no settlement of any such
Proceeding shall be agreed to without Parent's consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.11. _Rule 16b-3 Matters._ The Company shall take all reasonable
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to

Exchange Act.

shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to comply

Approval (except as otherwise expressly noted):

  


 

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

Date, the conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 6.01(b) or Section
6.01(c) (solely, in the case of Section 6.01(c), relating to a Legal Restraint
in respect of any Required Regulatory Approval) shall not have been satisfied
or waived, then the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by a period
of 180 calendar days and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to a party if the failure to
consummate the Merger is the result of a material breach of this Agreement by
such party; or

  


 

  

(ii) if any Legal Restraint permanently preventing or prohibiting consummation
of the Merger shall be in effect and shall have become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (ii) shall have complied with its obligations under
Section 5.03 in respect of any such Legal Restraint;

  


 

  

(c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b) and (ii) cannot be or has not
been cured prior to the earlier of (x) 30 days after the giving of written
notice to the Company of such breach and (y) the Outside Date ( _provided_

57

 

  


 

  

not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement);

  


 

  

(d) by Parent if (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred or (ii)

obligations pursuant to Section 4.03(a) or any of its other material
obligations under Section 4.03; _provided_ , in the case of each of clauses

pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) if the Stockholder Approval shall have been
obtained;

  


 

  

(e) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any
of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) and (ii) cannot be
or has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) 30 days after the giving of
written notice to Parent or Merger Sub of such breach and (y) the Outside Date

representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement);

  


 

  

(f) by the Company in accordance with Section 7.04(b); or

  


 

  

(g) by Parent, if the Stockholder Consent evidencing the Stockholder Approval

facsimile of such Stockholder Consent shall not have been provided to Parent,
in each case, prior to 6:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date immediately
following the date of this Agreement.

  


 

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01
(other than pursuant to Section 7.01(a)) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with Section 8.02.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand (except to the extent that such termination
results from the willful and material breach by a party of any representation,
warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement, in which case such party
shall be liable to the other party for damages which shall include, in the
case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, liability to the Company for lost
stockholder premium), other than the last sentence of Section 5.02, Section
5.07, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII, which provisions shall survive such
termination.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.03. _Amendment; Extension; Waiver._ (a) At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties may (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any

58

 

  


 

  

party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement
(treating Parent and Merger Sub as one party for this purpose).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) after the receipt of the Stockholder
Approval, there shall be made no amendment to this Agreement that by Law
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
approval having been obtained and (B) no amendment shall be made to this
Agreement after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(b) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any extension or waiver with respect to this Agreement shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  


 

  

SECTION 7.04. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._ (a)
A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 or an amendment of
this Agreement or an extension or waiver with respect to this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.03 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors (in the
case of the Company, by the affirmative vote of the majority of the
independent members thereof) or the duly authorized designee of its Board of
Directors (in the case of the Company, such designee having been nominated by
the affirmative vote of the majority of the independent members of the Company
Board). Termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 shall not
require the approval of the stockholders of the Company.

  


 

  

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) only
if (i) the Stockholder Approval has not been obtained, (ii) the Company Board
has received a Superior Company Proposal, (iii) the Company has complied in
all material respects with its obligations under Section 4.03(f) and (iv) the
Company has paid, or simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement
pays, the fee due under Section 5.07 that is payable if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(f).

 _General Provisions_

  


 

  

SECTION 8.01. _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties._ None of the

its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

Representations or Warranties._ (a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Support Agreement and the Consulting Agreement (i) constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties and their affiliates, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Confidentiality

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article II,

Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions. Neither the Company nor any
other Person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent's or Merger Sub's use of, any
such information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts

rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the Transactions, unless
and then only to the extent set forth in a representation or warranty
contained in Article II.

  


 

  

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article III,

SECTION 8.08. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.09. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent may assign, in
its sole discretion and at any time, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any of
its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.10. _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction._ (a) The parties
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or
any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 8.10(b),
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection

  


 

     

65

 

  


 

  

with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific enforcement shall
include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the
Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The parties further agree not
to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without such
right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement. If, prior
to the Outside Date, any party brings any Proceeding, in each case in
accordance with Section 8.10(b), to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such
Proceeding is pending, plus 20 business days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Proceeding, as the case may be.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such
court shall be unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware) for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such
Proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in such court. Each of the
parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be
unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) in
the event any Proceeding arises out of or relates to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the service of
process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property,
by U.S. registered mail to such party's respective address set forth in
Section 8.02 ( _provided_ that nothing in this Section 8.10(b) shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law or shall limit the notice obligations under Section 8.02) and (iv) agrees
that it will not bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions in any court other than
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be
unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). The
parties hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-
judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court
judgment.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction. Each party hereto (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented,

  


 

     

66

 

  


 

  

expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any
Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section
8.11.
