     SECTION 2.04 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. (a) At the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated to read in its

converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

     (d) The amounts payable upon the conversion of the Shares pursuant to this
Section 2.06 are referred to collectively as the "Merger Consideration". As of
the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration payable,
without interest, to the holder of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.10, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share.

     (e) In the event that (i) fewer than 25% of the Fully Diluted Shares are

respectively, such that sum of the number of Cash Payment Shares and Cash
Options is 25% of the Fully Diluted Shares or (ii) more than 25% of the Fully
Diluted Shares are Cash Payment Shares and Cash Options, such number of Cash
Payment Shares and Cash Options in excess of 25% of the Fully Diluted Shares
shall be deemed to be Earn Out Shares and Earn Out Options, respectively, such
that the sum of the number of Cash Payment Shares and Cash Options is 25% of the
Fully Diluted Shares. Any reduction or increase in the number of Earn Out
Shares, Cash Payment Shares, Earn Out Options or Cash Options, as the case may
be, effected pursuant to this Section 2.06(e) shall be made on a pro rata basis
among all of the Stockholders and Optionholders affected thereby; provided, that
(x) in no event shall any Mandatory Cash Option be deemed to be an Earn Out
Option, and (y) the reduction of Cash Payment Shares and Cash Options if more
than 25% of the Fully Diluted Shares are Cash Payment Shares and Cash Options
shall be made first on a pro rata basis among Cash Options that were unvested
until immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by employees (but not
directors) of the Company or individuals listed on Exhibit I, and then pro rata
among the remaining Cash Payment Shares and Cash Options (other than Mandatory
Cash Options).

     (f) Subject to Section 2.06(e), Stockholders shall be permitted to elect to
receive the Cash Consideration for some of their Shares and the Earn Out
Consideration for other of their Shares, and, subject to Section 2.06(e) and

Option Payment for some of their Company Stock Options and the Earn Out Option
Consideration for other of their Company Stock Options.

necessary action (which action shall be effective as of the Effective Time),
including obtaining the consent of the individual holders of Company Stock
Options at the Effective Time (the

                                       13
<PAGE>

"Optionholders"), if necessary, to (i) terminate the Company's 2003 Stock
Incentive Plan, 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan, 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, and the
MRPA 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, each as amended through the date of this
Agreement (the "Company Stock Option Plans") and (ii) cancel, as of the
Effective Time, each vested or unvested option to purchase a Share granted under
the Company Stock Option Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is
outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time, and (iii) vest, no later than
immediately before the Effective Time, all outstanding and unvested Company
Stock Options, including those held by non-employee directors of the Company.

     (b) Subject to Section 2.06(e), each holder of a Company Stock Option that
is outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time shall be entitled to
receive, in exchange for the cancellation of each such Company Stock Option:

          (i) For each Company Stock Option that is an Earn Out Option, the
     right to receive, without any further condition, from Bionics Trust the
     Earn Out Option Consideration; or

          (ii) For each Company Stock Option that is a Cash Option (which shall
     include each Mandatory Cash Option), the right to receive, without any
     further condition, from Bionics Trust the Cash Option Payment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that
the payment of any consideration pursuant to this Agreement, either alone or
together with other payments or distributions of any type (including any
accelerated vesting or payment of stock options or other awards) (collectively,
the "Total Payments") to or for any holder of Company Stock Options (other than
any "disqualified individual" as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code whose
name is not included on the list of individuals that is submitted to
Stockholders as part of the request for Stockholder approval of certain payments
pursuant to the shareholder approval requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1 Q-A 7) is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section
4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), the Total Payments shall be reduced (but
not below zero) so that the maximum amount of the Total Payments (after
reduction) shall be one dollar ($1) less than the amount that would cause the
Total Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax.

     SECTION 2.08 Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by Stockholders who have neither voted in favor
of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who demand properly in
writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or
Chapter 13 of the CGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
Such Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262
or Chapter 13, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Stockholders who have
failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Shares under such Section 262 or Chapter 13 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest

                                       14

thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.10, of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

     (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL or the CGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL or the CGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

     SECTION 2.09 Information Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare an information
statement (the "Information Statement") to be disseminated to the holders of
Shares and Company Stock Options for purposes of informing them of the
Transactions and giving them an opportunity to make, as applicable, the Earn Out
Election, the Cash Election, the Cash Option Election, the Earn Out Option
Election, or no election. Parent will cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Information Statement, and the Company will give Parent and
its counsel the opportunity to review all drafts thereof, and will accept all
reasonable comments of Parent thereon. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to
correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Information
Statement that shall have become false or misleading in any material respect,
and the Company further agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause the
Information Statement, as so corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares
and Company Stock Options.

     SECTION 2.10 Election; Payment. (a) Each person who, immediately before the
Effective Time, is (i) an Optionholder and either an employee or director of the
Company or an individual listed on Exhibit I or (ii) a record holder of Shares
shall be entitled, with respect to all or any portion of such Shares or Company
Stock Options, to make, as applicable, an irrevocable Earn Out Election, Cash
Election, Earn Out Option Election or Cash Option Election on or prior to the
Election Date, on the basis hereinafter set forth; provided, that all Mandatory
Cash Options shall be deemed to be Cash Options. Each person who, immediately
before the Effective Time, is an Optionholder who is not either an employee or
director of the Company or an individual listed on Exhibit I shall not be
entitled to make any such elections and all Company Stock Options held by such
persons shall be deemed to be Cash Options.

     (b) The Company shall prepare a letter of transmittal and election (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Surviving Corporation) (the "Letter
of Transmittal") and such Letter of Transmittal shall be mailed by the Company
with the Information Statement to the record holders of Shares and Company Stock
Options on the date of this Agreement, which Letter of Transmittal shall be used
(1) by each record holder of Shares to evidence such holder's election to
receive either the Earn Out Consideration or the Cash Consideration for any or
all Shares held by such holder and (2) by each record holder of Company Stock
Options to evidence such holder's election to receive either the Earn Out Option
Consideration or the applicable Cash Option Payment for Company Stock Options
held by such holder. Any such holder's election shall have been properly made
only if the Surviving Corporation receives, on or prior to the date that is 30
days after the

                                       15
<PAGE>

Effective Time (the "Election Date"), a Letter of Transmittal properly completed
and signed and, if applicable, accompanied by Certificates for the Shares to
which such Letter of Transmittal relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in
form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Surviving Corporation. The
Surviving Corporation shall provide to Parent copies of all Letters of
Transmittal, accompanying Certificates, and any other documentation relating to
such documents received from any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options as
soon as practical upon receipt thereof. If any holder of Shares is unable to
surrender such holder's Certificates because such Certificates have been lost,
mutilated or destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit and
indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation.

     (c) If no Letter of Transmittal is received with respect to any Shares or
Company Stock Options in accordance with Section 2.10(b), or if the Surviving
Corporation determines that any election is not properly made with respect to
any Shares or Company Stock Options, such Shares or Company Stock Options shall
be deemed to be Cash Payment Shares or Cash Options, as applicable, and shall be
treated as Cash Payment Shares or Cash Options, as applicable, at the Effective
Time and, subject to Section 2.06(e), such Shares or Options shall be converted
into the right to receive the consideration in respect thereof in accordance
with Section 2.06(a)(ii) or Section 2.07(b)(ii), as applicable.

     (d) The determination of the Surviving Corporation in its sole discretion
shall be binding as to whether elections have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this Section 2.10 with respect to Shares and Company Stock Options
and when elections and revocations were received by the Surviving Corporation.
The Surviving Corporation shall also make all computations as to the proration
contemplated by Section 2.06(e), and absent manifest error any such computation
shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of Shares and Company Stock
Options. The Surviving Corporation may establish such additional procedures as
are consistent with this Section 2.10 for the implementation of the elections
provided for herein as shall be necessary or desirable to fully effect such
elections.

     (e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

     (f) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.14, Scimed shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Bionics Trust an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the
aggregate Cash Option Payments, (ii) $21 multiplied by the number of Cash
Payment Shares, (iii) the aggregate Earn Out Option Payments and (iv) $11
multiplied by the number of Earn Out Shares. As soon as practicable, but in no
event later than 45 days after the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.14,
Bionics Trust will pay (i) for the benefit of each Stockholder (other than
holders of Shares canceled pursuant to Section 2.06(b)), an amount equal to the
sum of (A) the product of (1) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (2) the
number of Cash Payment Shares (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.06(e)) held by
such Stockholder, and (B) the product of (1) the Earn Out Cash Amount multiplied
by (2) the number of Earn Out Shares (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.06(e))
held by such Stockholder, and (ii) for the benefit of each Optionholder, an
amount equal

                                       16
<PAGE>

to the sum of (A) the Cash Option Payments with respect to each Cash Option (as
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.06(e)) held by such Optionholder, and (B) the
Earn Out Option Payments with respect to each Earn Out Option (as adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.06(e)) held by such Optionholder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the amount paid for the benefit of each holder of Earn Out Shares and
Earn Out Options pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be reduced by a pro rata
portion of up to $1,000,000, which will initially fund the Earn Out Expense
Fund. To effect the foregoing payments, Bionics Trust may appoint an
institution, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, as paying agent (the "Paying
Agent") to make payment in accordance with Sections 2.10 and 2.11 to each
Stockholder and Optionholder. In connection therewith, the Stockholders'
Representative shall prepare the list of the payments to be paid to each
Stockholder and Optionholder by Bionics Trust, and none of Parent, Scimed or any
of their affiliates shall have any liability to any Stockholder or Optionholder
in respect of such payments following payment by, or on behalf of, Scimed of the
amount required by this Agreement to the Bionics Trust, and the Paying Agent
shall not have any Liability to any Stockholder or Optionholder in respect of
payments made by it to the extent such payments are made consistent with the
Stockholders' Representative's list of payments.

     SECTION 2.11 Earn Out and Other Payments. (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable, and in any event no later than 45 days after the end of each fiscal
year during the Earn Out Period, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,
to the Stockholders' Representative and each Member appointed by the
Stockholders' Representative a statement (the "Annual Statement"), substantially
in the form of Exhibit F to this Agreement, showing Parent's calculation of the
Gross Margin Percentage and the Base Earn Out Payment, if any, payable with
respect to such fiscal year.

     (b) If the Stockholders' Representative or any Member appointed by the
Stockholders' Representative does not provide a Dispute Notice to Parent within
20 days after receipt of an Annual Statement, then the Earn Out Recipients shall
be deemed to have accepted the Annual Statement.

     (c) If, within 20 days after receipt of an Annual Statement, the
Stockholders' Representative or any Member appointed by the Stockholders'
Representative notifies Parent (a "Dispute Notice") that such person disputes
the calculation of the Base Earn Out Payment reflected therein, which Dispute
Notice shall state the nature of the dispute in reasonable detail and identify
the items and amounts in dispute, and if Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative are unable within 30 days after receipt by Parent of a Dispute
Notice to resolve any disputes, the Stockholders' Representative and Parent
shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Independent
Accounting Firm, which shall, within 30 business days after such submission,
determine and report to Parent and the Stockholders' Representative upon such
remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive
on Parent and Bionics Trust. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Parent and Bionics Trust in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears
to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted. The Earn Out
Payment with respect to such Base Earn Out Payment shall be reduced by the
amount of any such fees allocated to Bionics Trust.

                                       17
<PAGE>

     (d) During the period of any dispute provided for in Section 2.11(c), and
at any time during the Earn Out Period (but no more frequently than annually and
with respect to the immediately preceding fiscal year) at the reasonable request
of the Stockholders' Representative, Parent shall provide the Stockholders'
Representative and the Independent Accounting Firm reasonable access to the
books, records, facilities and employees of the Surviving Corporation and, to
the extent applicable, Parent, Scimed and their affiliates, and Parent and
Scimed shall cooperate, and cause their affiliates and the Surviving Corporation
to cooperate, with the Stockholders' Representative's accountants, to the extent
reasonably required by the Stockholders' Representative, and the Independent
Accounting Firm to investigate the basis for any such dispute.

     (e) Scimed shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Bionics Trust the required
Earn Out Payment with respect to a Base Earn Out Payment, if any, with respect
to a fiscal year during the Earn Out Period, within five business days after the
latest of (i) the date such Annual Statement has been accepted by the
Stockholders' Representative or deemed accepted by the Stockholders'
Representative and (ii) the date all disputes with respect to such Annual
Statement have been resolved in accordance with Section 2.11(c) (the later of
such dates, whether or not a Base Earn Out Payment is payable, and the date of a
payment with respect to Section 2.11(f) below, are referred to herein as a
"Payment Date"); provided, however, that Scimed shall pay, or cause to be paid,
the undisputed amount of any such Earn Out Payment no later than the 66th day
following the end of any fiscal year.

     (f) Except as set forth in the final sentence of the definition of
"Additional Earn Out Payment," any Earn Out Payments with respect to an
Additional Earn Out Payment shall be paid, or caused to be paid, by Scimed to
Bionics Trust not later than the 45th day after the last day of the calendar
month in which that applicable Additional Earn Out Payment becomes payable
pursuant to the definition of "Additional Earn Out Payment."

     (g) If, at the time of any payment pursuant to this Section 2.11, there are
any Off-Setting Amounts or Claimed Amounts, then, subject to Section 7.06(b),
such Off-Setting Amounts and Claimed Amounts shall be deducted from the portion
of the payment otherwise payable to Bionics Trust under this Section 2.11.

     (h) If, at the time of any payment pursuant to this Section 2.11, the Earn
Out Expense Fund contains an amount less than what the Stockholders'
Representative determines to be reasonably necessary for the Stockholders'
Representative to pay the costs and expenses arising out of the performance of
its duties under this Agreement, then an amount sufficient to increase the Earn
Out Expense Fund to that amount shall be deducted pro rata from any amounts
otherwise payable by Bionics Trust to Earn Out Recipients and deposited into an
account controlled by the Stockholders' Representative and identified in a
notice from the Stockholders' Representative to the Trustee.

     (i) The Stockholders' Representative shall prepare the list of the Earn Out
Payments to be paid to each Earn Out Recipient by Bionics Trust, and none of
Parent, Scimed or any of their affiliates shall have any liability to any Earn
Out Recipient in respect of any Earn Out Payment or portion thereof following
payment of such amount by, or on behalf of, Scimed to the Bionics Trust (subject
to any withholding and deduction under Section 2.14), and the

                                       18
<PAGE>

Paying Agent shall not have any Liability to any Stockholder or Optionholder in
respect of payments made by it to the extent such payments are made consistent
with the Stockholders' Representative's list of payments.

     SECTION 2.12 Stockholders' Representative. (a) The Letters of Transmittal
shall provide that any Stockholder or Optionholder receiving consideration
pursuant to this Agreement shall have agreed upon execution and delivery of the
Letters of Transmittal, that the Stockholders' Representative, will be appointed
as such person's Attorney-in-Fact and representative, with the obligations,
power and authority (i) to do any and all things and to execute any and all
documents or other papers, in each such person's name, place and stead, in any
way in which each such person could do if personally present, in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Transactions"), (ii) to amend, cancel or extend, or waive the terms of, this
Agreement or any ancillary agreement and (iii) to act on behalf of Bionics Trust
with respect to any claims (including the settlement thereof) made by Parent for
indemnification pursuant to Article VII or any dispute arising under Section
2.11 ; provided, however, that without the written consent of the Earn Out
Recipients who collectively hold more than 50% of the Earn Out Rights at such
time, the Stockholders' Representative shall not take or approve any of the
matters listed on Exhibit H; provided, further, that if the Stockholders'
Representative has not completed a required solicitation of consent and notified
Parent in writing of the results of such solicitation within 30 business days of
written request by Parent seeking the consent of the Earn Out Recipients with
respect to any of the matters listed on Exhibit H, such consent shall be deemed
not to have been provided. The solicitation of any consent referred to in the
preceding sentence shall be conducted by and at the expense of the Stockholders'
Representative. The Principal Stockholders, each Stockholder and Optionholder
that executes and delivers a Letter of Transmittal and each Earn Out Recipient
shall be bound by all actions taken by the Stockholders' Representative
consistent with this Section 2.12(a) in his, her or their capacity as the
Stockholders' Representative, and neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any of the Stockholders or Earn Out Recipients for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it in such reliance or for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by the Stockholders' Representative.

     (b) Any of the individuals constituting the Stockholders' Representative
may resign at any time or be removed by the vote or written consent of Earn Out
Recipients who collectively hold more than 50% of the Earn Out Rights; provided
however, that such resignation or removal shall not be effective until such time
as a successor to such individual shall have been elected. In the event of the
death, resignation or removal of any of the individuals who constitute the
Stockholders' Representative, a successor shall be elected (and may be removed
and replaced) by the remaining individuals who constitute the Stockholders'
Representative; provided that if no such individuals remain, such successor
shall be elected (and may be removed and replaced) by the vote or written
consent of Earn Out Recipients who collectively hold more than 50% of the Earn
Out Rights at such time, such election (or removal and replacement) to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by such new individual. Such
election shall be conducted by the Earn Out Recipient who holds the greatest
number of Earn Out Rights at such time who is willing to conduct the election,
and shall be paid for by the Earn Out Recipients.

                                       19

     (c) In connection with this Agreement and any instrument, agreement or
document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise
all or any of the powers conferred upon the Stockholders' Representative
hereunder, the Stockholders' Representative shall incur no responsibility
whatsoever to any Stockholder, Earn Out Recipient, or Bionics Trust by reason of
any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or
in connection with this Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or
document, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which
represents gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Earn Out Recipient and
Bionics Trust shall indemnify the Stockholders' Representative against all
Losses arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation, challenge,
action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the
acts or omissions of the Stockholders' Representative hereunder. The
Stockholders' Representative shall, at the expense of the Earn Out Recipients
and Bionics Trust, be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents
and consultants as he or she shall deem necessary in connection with exercising
his or her powers and performing his or her function hereunder.

     SECTION 2.13 Transfer of German Subsidiary. In the event that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the waiting period under the German Act Against the
Restraints of Competition has not expired or been terminated, the Company shall
enter into an agreement (the "German Subsidiary Agreement") pursuant to which
Parent and Scimed agree not to, and to cause their Subsidiaries not to, among
other things (i) exercise any voting rights associated with the shares of
Advanced Bionics GmbH ("ABG"), a German corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Company, (ii) dismiss or appoint any members of the management of ABG ,
or (iii) otherwise seek to influence the business decisions of the current
management as of the Effective Time until such time that the transfer of ABG may
be legally consummated pursuant to the German Act Against Restraints of
Competition. The German Subsidiary Agreement shall provide, among other things,
that during such period, the business of ABG will be conducted in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and that none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall cause ABG to make any distributions or dividends.

     SECTION 2.14 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Scimed and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amount as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly paid to the appropriate
tax authority, such amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the securities or rights in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made. The Stockholders' Representative and
the Bionics Trust shall provide reasonable assistance to Parent, Scimed and the
Surviving Corporation in connection with the determination of amounts required
to be deducted and withheld and compliance with related information reporting
requirements.

the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such

     (b) A true and complete list of the Subsidiaries of the Company, together
with the jurisdiction of incorporation of such Subsidiaries, the percentage of
the outstanding capital stock of each such Subsidiary owned by the Company and
each other Subsidiary of the Company, and the names of the directors and

     Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
     funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S.
     Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
     procure or provide for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis (actual
     or contingent) accrued to the date of this Agreement, with respect to all
     current and former participants in such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according to
     the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
     employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and no Transaction
     shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such
     benefit obligations; and

          (iii) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has been
     registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
     regulatory authorities. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is now and always has

Surviving Corporation's and Parent's obligations pursuant to this Section 5.02
shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the existing indemnification
agreements between the Company and its officers and directors, copies of which
have been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof.

     (b) The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall cause to be maintained in
effect for six years from the Effective Time the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided that
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a reputable
insurer of comparable credit quality of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous in the aggregate to such
persons) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation or Parent be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.02(b) more than an amount per year
equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be $236,656 in the
aggregate, and if the annual premium would exceed such maximum amount, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
reasonably available for a cost not exceeding the maximum amount).

     (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person and the Earn Out Recipients have
not exercised their rights pursuant to Section 7.06(c), then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent's option, Parent, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.02.

                                       41
<PAGE>

     (d) The Surviving Corporation or Parent shall pay all reasonable costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
person in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations set forth
in this Section 5.02.

     SECTION 5.03 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing the initial press release or other public
statement with respect to this Agreement. Except as provided in Section 2.09,
following the date of the initial press release, any press release or other
public statement with respect to this Agreement, any Transaction or the business
of the Surviving Corporation shall be made in accordance with Parent's
disclosure policies.

     SECTION 5.04 Post-Merger Management of the Company. (a) Parent and the
Company agree that the day-to-day management of the Surviving Corporation shall
be conducted by the officers of the Surviving Corporation, who are initially the
individuals set forth on Exhibit E, in accordance with the Bionics Plan;
provided however that the Surviving Corporation shall at all times be subject to
the corporate practices, policies and procedures of Parent, including in respect
of corporate governance (subject to the processes set forth in this Section 5.04
with respect to the selection or termination of any executive officer, with the
title of senior vice president or more senior, of the Surviving Corporation),
internal financial controls, compensation and benefits policies, regulatory and
legal compliance, clinical affairs, quality control and all policies, practices
and controls relating to the protection of Intellectual Property or the defense
or prosecution of claims relating to another person's Intellectual Property or
products. Parent shall appoint an employee of Parent with an appropriate level
of seniority and expertise to liaise with the Surviving Corporation and report
to James Tobin and either Alfred E. Mann or Jeffrey H. Greiner (or their
respective designees or successors as Chief Executive Officer or Co-Chief
Executive Officer, as applicable), for purposes of identifying whether any
particular Parent resources should be made available to the Surviving
Corporation, and developing synergies between Parent and its affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
as well as assuming any other responsibilities jointly identified by Mr. Tobin
and either Mr. Mann or Mr. Greiner (or any of their respective successors as
Chief Executive Officer or Co-Chief Executive Officer, as applicable).

     (b) The parties shall establish at the Effective Time, an executive board
(the "Executive Board"). Each of Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
shall be entitled to designate three persons (each, a "Member") to the Executive
Board. Parent's initial designees to the Executive Board are Fredericus Colen,
Lawrence C. Best and David B. Milne, and the Stockholders' Representative's
initial designees are Alfred E. Mann, Jeffrey H. Greiner and David Morley. Any
vacancy on the Executive Board created by the resignation, incapacity or death
of a Member shall be filled, (i) in the case of the resignation, incapacity or
death of a Member designated by Parent, by an individual designated by Parent,
and (ii) in the case of the resignation, incapacity or death of a Member
designated by the Stockholders' Representative, an individual designated by the
Stockholders' Representative. The filling of any and all vacancies of the
Executive Board shall be made in accordance with this Section 5.04(b). The
Executive Board may, at the option of Parent, be disbanded at any time after
December 31, 2013.

     (c) The Executive Board shall meet at least quarterly. Additional meetings
of the Executive Board may be held at any time, by written notice given by any
Member to Parent, the

                                       42
<PAGE>

Stockholders' Representative and each other Member at least five days prior to
the meeting. Subject to appropriate confidentiality provisions, the Members
designated by the Stockholders' Representative may consult with and inform the
Stockholders' Representative regarding the matters discussed at meetings of, and
actions taken by, the Executive Board. No action shall be taken by the Executive
Board without a Quorum. A "Quorum" shall consist of at least four Members, two
of whom have been designated by Parent and two of whom have been designated by
the Stockholders' Representative. All decisions of the Executive Board shall
require the affirmative vote of all Members in attendance at the meeting at
which a Quorum is present. The Executive Board may establish subcommittees or
working groups that include non-Members; provided, however, such subcommittees
and working groups shall not be empowered to make any binding decisions and
shall be limited to making recommendations to the Executive Board.

     (d) Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.04(a) and 5.04(g), the
Executive Board shall be responsible for the overall strategic direction and
operations of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Surviving
Corporation in their day-to-day management of the Surviving Corporation shall be
responsible to the Executive Board. In addition, the Executive Board shall
specifically (i) consider modifications to the forecasts contained in the
Bionics Plan, (ii) consider incremental funding requirements of the Surviving
Corporation, (iii) consider new applications of the Surviving Corporation's
technology (including third party alliances) and new product offerings not
developed by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, (iv) consider the
appropriate sales channels for the Earn Out Products following the occurrence of
an event described in Section 5.04(f)(i) and fully participate in the training
of any personnel involved in the sale of Earn Out Products through such sales
channel, (v) resolve, if possible, disagreements that may arise in connection
with this Agreement, (vi) determine whether, and if so, what, adjustments to any
Earn Out Payment should be made if either the Intellectual Property of Parent or
its Subsidiaries is incorporated into Earn Out Products or the Intellectual
Property of the Company or its Subsidiaries is incorporated into products of
Parent or its Subsidiaries other than Earn Out Products, and (vii) consider and
take actions with respect to such other matters as the Stockholders'
Representative and Parent may from time to time agree.

     (e) Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.04(a) and 5.04(g) and without
limiting the provisions of Section 5.04(d), the parties hereto agree that, for
the benefit of the Earn Out Recipients, without the approval of the Executive
Board, neither Parent (including any of its affiliates) nor the Surviving
Corporation shall, during the Earn Out Period:

          (i) license, or transfer in any manner whatsoever, any of the
     Surviving Corporation's Intellectual Property to any person other than
     Parent and its Subsidiaries, unless such license or transfer is necessary
     to settle an Action that substantively involves any Earn Out Product;

          (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation, directly or indirectly, to
     engage, participate or invest in any business outside the scope of its
     business as described in the Bionics Plan;

          (iii) set the pricing for any Earn Out Product below its fair market
     value; provided however that if any Earn Out Product is part of a Bundled
     Product, the price of such Earn Out Product can be discounted or reduced by
     Parent such that any products of

                                       43
<PAGE>

     Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation and its
     Subsidiaries) included in such Bundled Product are proportionately
     discounted or reduced and the Earn Out Product is not bearing a
     disproportionate amount of the overall reduction or rebate with respect to
     the Bundled Product; and provided further that Parent can offer to
     customers only discounts or rebates on Earn Out Products that are
     proportional to discounts and rebates offered to customers for similar
     products of Parent and its Subsidiaries other than Earn Out Products;

          (iv) appoint any executive officer of the Surviving Corporation other
     than those appointed pursuant to Section 5.04(g);

          (v) terminate the employment of any executive officer, with the title
     of senior vice president or more senior, of the Surviving Corporation or
     cause any such executive officer to have Good Reason to leave the Surviving
     Corporation;

          (vi) cause the Surviving Corporation to make any distributions or
     dividends other than cash dividends subject to 5.04(f)(ii);

          (vii) sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, through
     merger, consolidation, or otherwise in any transaction or series of
     transactions, 50% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or
     outstanding voting interests, all or substantially all of the assets of the
     Surviving Corporation, or any of the Surviving Corporation's Intellectual
     Property that is material to any Earn Out Product;

          (viii) fail to conduct the business of the Surviving Corporation in
     accordance with Law in all material respects; or

          (ix) offer to any employee of the Surviving Corporation any transfer
     or other employment opportunity with Parent or any of its affiliates (other
     than the Surviving Corporation); provided, that the foregoing shall not
     apply to employees of Parent or any of its affiliates (other than the
     Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) that are seconded to, or
     employed by, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries and shall not
     prohibit Parent or any of its affiliates from offering employment to any
     person who contacts them on his or her own initiative (including in
     response to a general solicitation) and without direct or indirect
     solicitation by Parent or its affiliates.

     (f) In addition, the Company and Parent agree that, during the Earn Out
Period:

          (i) if Parent or any of its affiliates acquires any entity that
     develops, markets or sells any neuromodulation product that is directly
     competitive with any of the Earn Out Products, the Members of the Executive
     Board appointed by the Stockholders' Representative may cause the Surviving
     Corporation to (A) continue to sell those Earn Out Products in a manner
     that is consistent with how such Earn Out Products were sold immediately
     prior to the occurrence of such event or (B) enter into an agreement with a
     third party distributor for the marketing and sale of such Earn Out
     Products; provided however that, at the request of the Stockholders'
     Representative, Parent shall consider in good faith whether, and, if so, to
     what extent, any sales force of such acquired entity should be used to sell
     such Earn Out Products, and if Parent determines to use such sales

                                       44
<PAGE>

     force in the sale of any Earn Out Products, such sales force will be
     appropriately qualified to sell such Earn Out Products; and

          (ii) if Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to make any
     distributions or dividends of cash, then, within 30 days of a request from
     the Members of the Executive Board appointed by the Stockholders'
     Representative based upon the reasonable determination of such Members that
     such funds are required to meet the cash flow needs of the Company, an
     amount up to or equal to the aggregate amount of such distributions and
     dividends (such amount to be determined by such Members in their reasonable
     discretion) shall be made available by Parent to the Surviving Corporation.

     (g) (i) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.04(a), in the event that the
Executive Board cannot reach agreement on a matter, including any of the matters
described in Section 5.04(e), the matter will be referred to Alfred E. Mann and
James Tobin (or their successors as Chief Executive Officer or Co-Chief
Executive Officer, as applicable) for resolution by them. If Messieurs Tobin and
Mann, or their respective successors as Chief Executive Officer or Co-Chief
Executive Officer, as applicable, cannot reach agreement, then Mr. Tobin (or his
successor as Chief Executive Officer) shall decide the matter. If Mr. Mann (or
his successor as Co-Chief Executive Officer) disagrees with the decision of Mr.
Tobin (or his successor as Chief Executive Officer) with respect to such matter,
he or she may notify Parent of that disagreement. If Mr. Mann and Mr. Tobin (or
their respective successors as Chief Executive Officer or Co-Chief Executive
Officer, as applicable) fail to reach agreement on how best to resolve such
matter within 15 days of that notice, Mr. Mann (or his successor as Co-Chief
Executive Officer) may refer such matter to a committee composed of three
independent business people experienced in medical device businesses jointly
selected by Mr. Mann and Mr. Tobin (or their respective successors as Chief
Executive Officer or Co-Chief Executive Officer, as applicable). This committee
shall act promptly to propose a resolution of such matter, but shall, in any
event, propose a resolution of such matter within 30 days of the matter being
referred to it. Each of Parent and the Stockholder' Representative shall have
the opportunity to present its view of the appropriate resolution of such matter
to such committee, orally or in writing as determined by such committee, and the
costs and expenses of such committee shall be borne equally by Parent, on the
one hand, and the Earn Out Recipients (as a reduction to the succeeding Earn Out
Payment) on the other hand. Subsequent Earn Out Payments shall be reduced by the
amount of any such costs and expenses allocated to the Earn Out Recipients. Each
of the members of such committee shall be entitled to the privileges and
immunities of arbitrators in connection with their action thereon. Any
resolution proposed by such committee shall be nonbinding, and shall be
inadmissible in evidence in any litigation among the parties or the Earn Out
Recipients with respect to this Agreement.

     (ii) (A) If Mr. Tobin (or his successor as chief executive officer of
Parent) makes a decision pursuant to Section 5.04(g)(i) over the objection of
the Executive Board and Mr. Mann (or his successor as chief executive officer of
the Surviving Corporation), and the Stockholders' Representative, on behalf of
the Earn Out Recipients, wishes to challenge such decision, the Stockholders'
Representative will have the burden of establishing that (x) such decision,
based on the circumstances existing and reasonably foreseeable at the time of
such decision and taking into account the reasonable business objectives of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, unreasonably adversely affected the
ability of the Earn Out Recipients to realize the

                                       45
<PAGE>

Earn Out Payments, and (y) but for such decision, the Earn Out Payments would
have been greater; provided that if, following such decision, Aggregate Net
Sales and Gross Margin Percentage are consistent with the Bionics Plan for the
applicable period (without considering any modifications to the Bionics Plan
after the date of this Agreement), none of the Stockholders' Representative or
any Earn Out Recipient will have any rights or remedies with respect to any such
decision. The proviso in the foregoing sentence will not apply to any decision
with respect to the restricted actions set forth in Sections 5.04(e)(i) and
(vii). Nothing in this Section 5.04(g)(ii)(A) is intended to limit the amount of
damages that the Earn Out Recipients would be entitled to receive hereunder to
the amount of Earn Out Payments that they would have received if the Aggregate
Net Sales and Gross Margin Percentage were equal to the amounts set forth in the
Bionics Plan for the applicable period (without considering any modifications to
the Bionics Plan after the date of this Agreement).

     (B) If (w) Mr. Tobin (or his successor as chief executive officer of
Parent) makes a decision pursuant to Section 5.04(g)(i) over the objection of
the Executive Board and Mr. Mann (or his successor as chief executive officer of
the Surviving Corporation) that relates to the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to achieve the $100 million Net Sales amount set forth in clause
(i)(E) of the definition of "Additional Earn Out Payment," or (x) if
Intellectual Property of the Surviving Corporation used to any material extent
in any BION Product is used, directly or indirectly, to settle an Action that
does not relate solely to one or more Earn Out Products, and (y) the Surviving
Corporation does not achieve such Net Sales amount, and (z) the Stockholders'
Representative, on behalf of the Earn Out Recipients, wishes to challenge such
decision or action, the Stockholders' Representative will have the burden of
establishing that (1) such decision or action, based on the circumstances
existing and reasonably foreseeable at the time of such decision and taking into
account the reasonable business objectives of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, unreasonably adversely affected the ability of the Earn Out
Recipients to realize such Additional Earn Out Payment, and (2) but for such
decision or action, such Additional Earn Out Payment would have been realized;
provided that if Parent can establish that but for such decision or action the
Aggregate Net Sales and Gross Margin Percentage set forth in the Bionics Plan
(without considering any modifications to the Bionics Plan after the date of
this Agreement) would not have been achieved for the applicable period, none of
the Stockholders' Representative or any Earn Out Recipient will have any rights
or remedies with respect to any such decision or action.

     (iii) In the event that Mr. Mann or Mr. Greiner cease to be a co-chief
executive officer of the Company, Mr. Mann and Mr. Tobin (or his successor as
Chief Executive Officer) shall jointly agree on whether there should be a
successor to such person as co-chief executive officer, and, if so, the identity
of such successor. In the absence or incapacity of Mr. Mann, Mr. Tobin (or his
successor as Chief Executive Officer) and, so long as he continues to be the
chief executive or principal officer of the Company, Mr. Greiner will jointly
agree on the identity of the co-chief executive or principal officer of the
Company. In the absence or incapacity of both Mr. Mann and Mr. Greiner, Mr.
Tobin (or his successor as Chief Executive Officer) shall designate the chief
executive or principal officer of the Company, following consultation with the
Stockholders' Representative as to the identity and qualifications of such
candidate; provided that if the Stockholders' Representative does not agree to
the selection of such person as chief executive or principal officer, it may, at
its option, refer such matter for resolution to the

                                       46
<PAGE>

committee described in Section 5.04(g)(i) for resolution by such committee in
accordance with such clause.

     (h) None of Parent or any of its affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, shall be liable to any Earn Out Recipient for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Surviving Corporation at the
direction, or with the approval, of the Executive Board.

     (i) The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the members of the Executive Board, and shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain insurance for such members, to the same extent as with respect
to officers and directors of the Company pursuant to Section 5.02.

     (j) Each of Parent, Scimed, Purchaser, and the Surviving Corporation, on
behalf of itself and its stockholders and affiliates, and the Stockholders'
Representative on behalf of itself and the Earn Out Recipients, hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any Action, any claim that the rights and obligations granted to
the Executive Board pursuant this Section 5.04 constitute an impermissible
delegation of management by the Surviving Corporation's Board of Directors, or
otherwise violate applicable Law.

     SECTION 5.05 Funding Requirements. Scimed shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to the Company cash in an amount reasonably sufficient to meet the
external cash flow needs of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with,
and on the dates set forth in, the Bionics Plan up to and until December 31,
2006; provided, however, that Scimed shall not be obligated by this Section 5.05
to provide, or cause to be provided, any amount in excess of $100 million in the
aggregate unless any such amount is approved by the Executive Board.

     SECTION 5.06 Key Employee Incentive Plan. In addition to the eligibility of
employees of the Surviving Corporation to participate in Parent's employee
equity incentive plans pursuant to Section 5.01 and in ordinary compensation and
long term incentive plans of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Corporation shall implement a separate long term incentive plan for new and
newly promoted existing employees of the Surviving Corporation in the amount of
$10 million. Parent shall contribute $7.6 million to the Surviving Corporation
to fund such plan in five equal installments in each of the 2005 through 2009
fiscal years; and Earn Out Payments paid in each of the 2005 through 2009 fiscal
years shall be reduced by $2 million in each such fiscal year in respect of the
Earn Out Recipients' portion of the funding of such plan. Any amounts so
contributed that have not been spent by December 31, 2009 in accordance with
this Section 5.06 shall revert, pro rata, to Parent and the Earn Out
Recipients.

     SECTION 5.07 Discharge of Indebtedness. As promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within 20 business days, after the Effective Time,
Scimed shall repay, or cause to be repaid, the outstanding Indebtedness of the
Company listed in Section 5.07 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 5.08 Conduct of Business. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any
action that would cause the representation and warranty contained in Section
3.08(c) not to be true if such action had been taken prior to the date hereof.

                                       47
<PAGE>

     SECTION 5.09 Certificate of Incorporation. Neither Parent, Scimed nor the
Surviving Corporation shall amend or cause to be amended Section 2 of Article 5
or Article IX of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
without the prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative.

     SECTION 5.10 Bion License Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall not
amend the Bion License Agreement in any manner that will increase the amounts
indemnifiable by the Earn Out Recipients pursuant to Section 7.02(e).

     SECTION 5.11 Knowledge Prior to Effective Time. To the extent that the
Company becomes aware prior to the Effective Time of any fact or circumstance
that would cause any of the representations or warranties in Article III,
Section 8.10 or Section 8.11 not to be true and correct or becomes aware that it
has failed to comply with Section 5.08, the Company shall immediately notify the
Parent thereof.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                   TAX MATTERS

     SECTION 6.01 Returns and Payments. With respect to any Tax Returns relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries having a due date on or before the Effective
Time or within 30 days thereafter, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy
of such completed Tax Return together with appropriate supporting information
and schedules at least 30 business days prior to the due date (including any
extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, and Parent shall have the
right to review and comment on such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing
of such Tax Return. The Company shall reflect (or cause to be reflected) on such
Tax Return any reasonable comments provided by Parent not less than five days
prior to the due date (including any extensions thereof) for the filing of such
Tax Return. With respect to such income Tax Returns for periods ending prior to
the Effective Time, but with due dates (including any extension thereof) after
the Effective Time, the Company shall prepare all such returns in a manner
consistent with the Company's past practices (except to the extent that
Company's counsel advises that there is no reasonable basis for a position or
determines that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared without being subject to
penalties), and shall deliver a copy of each such income Tax Return to the
Stockholders' Representative 30 business days prior to the date of filing of
each such Tax Return, and the Stockholders' Representative shall have the right
to review and comment on each such Tax Return.

     SECTION 6.02 Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Stockholders'
Representative, Parent, Scimed and the Bionics Trust shall provide each other
with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request
of the other (and Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide
such cooperation and information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return
or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of
Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect
of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities. The
Stockholders' Representative, Parent, Scimed and the Bionics Trust shall make
themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide explanations of any

                                       48
<PAGE>

documents or information provided under this Section 6.01. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary hereto, each of the Stockholders and Parent shall
retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or other documents
in its possession (or in the possession of its affiliates) relating to Tax
matters of the Company or its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods prior to the
Effective Time and any taxable periods beginning before and ending after the
Effective Time until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents
relate (without regard to extensions) or (ii) six years following the due date
(without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time, before the applicable
Stockholder shall dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the
possession of its affiliates), Parent shall be given an opportunity to remove
and retain all or any part of such documents at its expense. Any information
obtained under this Section 6.02 shall be kept confidential, except as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for
refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

     SECTION 6.03 Conveyance Taxes. Any Conveyance Taxes payable in connection
with the Transactions shall be borne by the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable. The Company, after review by and consent of Parent,
shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any such Conveyance
Taxes to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Effective Time in accordance
with any available pre-sale filing procedure. Parent shall execute and deliver
all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Company to comply with
the foregoing.

     SECTION 6.04 Miscellaneous. From and after the date of this Agreement, none
of the Company or the Stockholders shall, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make, or cause or permit to be made, any Tax election that would affect
the Company or its Subsidiaries.



                                   ARTICLE VII
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     SECTION 7.01 Survival of Representations and Warranties. (a) The
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time until the date that is 18 months from the Effective
Time; provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties made
pursuant to Sections 3.10, 3.11 and 3.15 shall survive until the fourth
anniversary of the Effective Time, (ii) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.14 shall survive the Effective Time until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in
question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof made
before the Effective Time or with the consent of the Stockholders'
Representative after the Effective Time, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, which consent shall in no event be required for extensions of the
statute of limitations resulting from extensions of the time to file Tax Returns
for the Company for the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years) and (iii) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.13(c) shall, with respect
to any Intellectual Property used in or relating to an Earn Out Product
Category, survive the Effective Time until 36 months after the first commercial
sale in the United States (following receipt of applicable regulatory approvals
or clearances) of an Earn Out Product that falls within that Earn Out Product
Category. Neither the period of survival nor the liability of the Earn Out

                                       49
<PAGE>

Recipients with respect to the representations and warranties of the Company
shall be reduced by any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of
Parent. If written notice of a claim has been given prior to the expiration of
the applicable representations and warranties by Parent to the Stockholders'
Representative, then the relevant representations and warranties shall survive
as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.

     (b) The representations and warranties of Parent, Scimed and Purchaser
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time until the date that
is 18 months from the Effective Time. Neither the period of survival nor the
liability of Parent, Scimed and Purchaser with respect to Parent's, Scimed's and
Purchaser's representations and warranties shall be reduced by any investigation
made at any time by or on behalf of the Stockholders. If written notice of a
claim has been given prior to the expiration of the applicable representations
and warranties by the Stockholders' Representative to Parent, then the relevant
representations and warranties shall survive as to such claim, until such claim
has been finally resolved.

     SECTION 7.02 Indemnification by the Earn Out Recipients. Following the
Effective Time, Parent, Scimed, Purchaser and their affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each
a "Parent Indemnified Party") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Earn
Out Recipients, solely by means, and to the extent, of the Parent Indemnified
Parties' right of offset against future Earn Out Payments pursuant to Section
7.06 for and against any and all losses, damages, costs and expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties (including attorneys' and consultants' fees and
expenses) actually suffered or incurred by them (hereinafter a "Loss"), arising
out of or resulting from:

     (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
contained in this Agreement (it being understood that such representations and
warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to any limitations or
qualifications as to "materiality" (including the word "material"), or "Material
Adverse Effect" set forth therein);

     (b) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company contained in
this Agreement;

     (c) the breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section
3.07(c);

     (d) without duplication of any Losses recovered or recoverable by a Parent
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or (b), (i) 50% of all costs and
expenses (including attorneys' and consultants' fees and expenses) arising out
of or resulting from any Third Party Claim that alleges that any Earn Out
Product infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual Property of a third party
(an "Intellectual Property Claim"), or any actions taken by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in asserting counterclaims or taking any other reasonable
actions in connection with an Intellectual Property Claim, (ii) 50% of any
royalties payable to a third party in respect of an Intellectual Property Claim,
(iii) 50% or, in the case of the ANSI Litigation, 65% of all judgments, awards,
damages or penalties determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
payable by Parent or any of its affiliates in respect of an Intellectual
Property Claim, (iv) 25%, or in the case of the ANSI Litigation, 50% of any
amounts paid by Parent or any of its affiliates (other than royalties, which are
covered by clause (ii) above) in respect of the settlement of an Intellectual
Property Claim; provided, that, notwithstanding anything else in this

                                       50
<PAGE>

Agreement, any Off-Setting Amounts or Claimed Amounts resulting from clauses
(iii) and (iv) above shall be deducted in three equal installments from the next
three Earn Out Payments unless there are fewer than three fiscal years remaining
in the Earn Out Period, in which case any such Off-Setting Amounts or Claimed
Amounts shall be deducted from the next Earn Out Payments in the number of equal
installments equal to the number of fiscal years remaining; provided, further,
that in the event that any such Earn Out Payment is less than the amount of the
Off-Setting Amounts or Claimed Amounts, the shortfall shall be subtracted from
the next Earn Out Payment, if any;

     (e) 50% of the positive difference between (x) the minimum royalties
payable by the Company to the Alfred Mann Foundation pursuant to the Bion
License Agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (y) the
royalties paid by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the Bion License
Agreement based on the applicable actual sales by the Surviving Corporation; or

     (f) Taxes imposed or assessed with respect to a taxable period (or portion
of a taxable period) ending on or prior to the Effective Time that are (i)
attributable to a Tax Return filed after the Effective Time in a manner
consistent with the practices employed by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) in excess of the amounts shown as due on such Tax Return as
filed; provided that, in the case of a corporate income Tax Return, Deloitte &
Touche LLP shall be engaged for its preparation.

To the extent that the Earn Out Rights holders' undertakings set forth in this
Section 7.02 may be unenforceable, such holders shall permit the offset against
future Earn Out Payments of the maximum amount that they are permitted to offset
under applicable Law for the payment and satisfaction of all Losses incurred by
Parent Indemnified Parties.

     SECTION 7.03 Indemnification by Parent. Following the Effective Time, the
Stockholders and Optionholders and their affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a
"Stockholder Indemnified Party") shall be indemnified and held harmless by
Parent for and against any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting from:

     (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent, Scimed or
Purchaser contained in this Agreement (it being understood that such
representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to any
limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" (including the word
"material") set forth therein); or

     (b) the breach of any covenant or agreement by Parent, Scimed or Purchaser
contained in this Agreement.

To the extent that Parent's undertakings set forth in this Section 7.03 may be
unenforceable, Parent shall contribute the maximum amount that it is permitted
to contribute under applicable Law to the payment and satisfaction of all Losses
incurred by the Stockholder Indemnified Parties.

     SECTION 7.04 Limits on Indemnification. (a) An Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or
7.03(a), unless and

                                       51
<PAGE>

until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from
the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $12,000,000 (the "Aggregate Threshold")
in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all such Losses, (b)
any Losses resulting from a single claim or a series of related claims arising
out of an individual breach of any representation or warranty that totals less
than the Per Claim Threshold shall be excluded in their entirety from
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.02(a) and 7.03(a), and the Indemnified
Party shall have no recourse for such Losses, and (c) the maximum amount of
Losses which may be recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or
resulting from the causes set forth in (i) Section 7.02 shall be an amount equal
to the Earn Out Payments not yet paid at the time any claim for indemnification
is made or (ii) Section 7.03 shall be an amount equal to the Earn Out Payments
not yet paid at the time any claim for indemnification is made plus, in the
event the event giving rise to such indemnification claim is the failure by
Scimed to pay, or cause to be paid, any Earn Out Payment then due or has
resulted in any Earn Out Payment being less than it would have been if Parent,
Scimed or Purchaser had complied with their obligations under this Agreement,
the amount of such unpaid Earn Out Payment or the amount of such difference, as
applicable, together, without duplication, with any reasonable costs, expenses
and interest incurred by the Earn Out Recipients in pursuing such claims. The
amount of any Loss shall be increased to take into account any Tax cost, and
reduced to take account of the amount of any Tax benefit, actually realized by
the Indemnified Party or any affiliate or group of affiliates of such
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss. For
the avoidance of doubt, Losses or other amounts paid in respect of an
Intellectual Property Claim shall be excluded in their entirety in determining
whether the Aggregate Threshold has been satisfied.

     SECTION 7.05 Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims. (a) An Indemnified Party
shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any matter other than a Third Party
Claim which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to
a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 60 days of such
determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article
VII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure.

     (b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit,
demand or assessment (each, a "Third Party Claim") against it or which may give
rise to a claim for Loss under this Article VII, within 30 days of the receipt
of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice
of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure to provide such
notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article VII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any
Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at
its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within five days of the receipt of
such notice from the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if there exists
or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would, in the
reasonable judgment of counsel to the Indemnified Party, make it inappropriate
for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the

                                       52
<PAGE>

Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its
own counsel in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines
counsel is required at the expense of the Indemnifying Party and such counsel
shall be entitled to full participation in the defense of or prosecution of
counterclaims related to any such claim and the Indemnifying Party shall direct
its counsel to reasonably cooperate in connection therewith; and provided,
further that in respect of any matter relating to Intellectual Property or
Taxes, Parent shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at its expense, Parent
and such counsel shall be entitled to fully control the defense of, and the
prosecution of counterclaims related to, any such claim, and Parent shall direct
its counsel to reasonably cooperate with counsel of the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the
event of any Third Party Claim brought by, on behalf of or for the benefit of
any affiliate of the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall
control the defense thereof, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
notwithstanding the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party therefor. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to
undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above,
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in
the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly,
in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the
defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses,
records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or
under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may be settled by
the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall have the right, at its expense, to control any Tax audits or Tax
proceedings with respect to issues relating to a potential claim relating to
Taxes for which Parent would be liable. Furthermore, the Stockholders'
Representative shall not enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim
pursuant to a Tax audit or Tax proceeding which would adversely affect Parent,
the Company, its Subsidiaries or their affiliates for a subsequent taxable
period without the written consent of Parent.

     SECTION 7.06 Hold-back and Set-off of Losses Against Earn Out Payments. (a)
If a Parent Indemnified Party has made a claim for indemnification for a
specified amount with respect to any Loss in accordance with this Article VII,
and (i) the Stockholders' Representative shall not have objected to the amount
claimed by Parent Indemnified Party for indemnification with respect to such
Loss in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article VII or (ii) the
Stockholders' Representative shall have delivered notice of its disagreement as
to the amount of any indemnification requested by the Parent Indemnified Party
and either (A) the Stockholders' Representative and the Parent Indemnified Party
shall have, subsequent to the giving of such notice, mutually agreed that the
Earn Out Recipients are obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Party for
a specified amount or (B) a final nonappealable judgment shall have been
rendered in the Parent Indemnified Party's favor for a specified amount by the
court having jurisdiction over the matters relating to such claim by the Parent
Indemnified Party for

                                       53
<PAGE>

indemnification from the Earn Out Recipients, then each such specified amount
shall constitute an "Off-Setting Amount."

     (b) If a Parent Indemnified Party has made a claim for indemnification with
respect to any Loss in accordance with this Article VII, and such claim has not
been resolved in accordance with Section 7.06(a), then an amount in respect of
such claim, as reasonably determined by Parent in its good faith judgment to be
an appropriate amount, taking into account, among other things, the likely
amount of future Earn Out Payments, shall constitute a "Claimed Amount". If the
final amount of such claim as agreed by Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative or as determined by a final nonappealable judgment is less than
the Claimed Amount in respect thereof, Scimed shall, within 10 business days of
such determination, pay or cause to be paid (i) the difference between the
Claimed Amount and such finally determined amount, plus (ii) interest at an
annual rate of 500 basis points plus the then-current rate under the
then-outstanding principal revolving credit agreement of Parent (or, if no such
agreement exists at such time, the rate at which Parent could enter into a
similar agreement with a nationally recognized, third-party commercial lender),
adjusted every six months thereafter until the claim is finally determined, for
the period between the applicable Payment Date and the date such amount is paid
to the Earn Out Recipients in accordance with this Section 7.06(b).

     (c) If Parent or its Subsidiaries receives a bona fide offer ("Bona Fide
Offer") from any third party other than a Subsidiary pursuant to which Parent or
its Subsidiaries proposes to sell, or otherwise dispose of or transfer, directly
or indirectly, through merger, consolidation, or otherwise in any transaction or
series of transactions, 50% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or
other voting securities, all or substantially all of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation, or any of the Surviving Corporation's Intellectual Property that is
material to any Earn Out Product, and such Bona Fide Offer has been approved by
Mr. Tobin (or his successor as Chief Executive Officer) over the objection of
the Executive Board pursuant to Section 5.04(g)(i), then the Earn Out Recipients
(acting through the Stockholders' Representative) shall have a right to purchase
such interest in the Surviving Corporation or its assets that is the subject of
the Bona Fide Offer on the same terms, including price, as the Bona Fide Offer.
Parent shall, promptly after its receipt of a Bona Fide Offer, notify the
Stockholders' Representative in writing of the terms and conditions of such
offer (the "Offer Notice"). If the Stockholders' Representative does not, within
twenty-five business days of its receipt of the Offer Notice, notify Parent in
writing of the determination of the Earn Out Recipients to purchase such
interest or assets on such terms, the Earn Out Recipients shall forfeit all
rights under this Section 7.06(c) with respect to such Bona Fide Offer.

     SECTION 7.07 Treatment of Adjustments. The Earn Out Recipients, on the one
hand, and Parent and Scimed, on the other hand, agree that all payments made by
or on behalf of either of them to or for the benefit of the other (including any
payments to the Company or its Subsidiaries) under this Article VII shall be
treated as adjustments to the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except
to the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in
which case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify the
relevant party on an after-Tax basis.

                                       54
<PAGE>

     SECTION 7.08 Exclusive Remedy. Except in respect of remedies for fraud by a
party or as provided in Section 8.08, (a) the indemnification set forth in this
Agreement shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to each
other related to the subject matter of this Agreement, and each party waives any
other statutory, equitable or common law remedy that such party would otherwise
have for any claim related to this Agreement or any breach of this Agreement,
and (b) no Parent Indemnified Party shall have any rights or claims whatsoever
related to the subject matter of this Agreement, including in respect of
indemnification obligations, against Bionics Trust or any Earn Out Recipient
other than the right to offset against as yet unpaid Earn Out Payments as
described in Section 7.06. With respect to any claim related to the subject
matter of this agreement, in no event shall any party be liable for special,
incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages, whether or not caused
by or resulting from the negligence of such party.


                                  ARTICLE VIII
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

Effective Time shall have occurred.

     SECTION 8.02 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time prior to the Effective Time by an instrument in writing signed by
each of the parties hereto.

any obligation or other act of any party hereto, (b) waiver of any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of any party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waiver of compliance with any
agreement of any party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party
or parties to be bound thereby.

     SECTION 8.04 Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be

overnight courier, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return
receipt requested) to the respective parties at the following addresses (or at

     SECTION 8.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

     SECTION 8.06 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement shall not be assigned by any party hereto, except that Parent, Scimed
and Purchaser may assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to
any affiliate of Parent, provided that no such assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform
such obligations.

     SECTION 8.07 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

     SECTION 8.08 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other
remedy at Law or equity.

     SECTION 8.09 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan of The City of New York. In the event that jurisdiction is not
available in any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City
of New York, the parties agree that all such actions and proceedings shall be
heard in the state courts of Delaware located in the City of Wilmington. The
parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party hereto (subject to the preceding sentence), and (b) irrevocably waive,
and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such
Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the
above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,

                                       57
<PAGE>
