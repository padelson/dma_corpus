conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective
Time, AcquisitionCo shall be merged with and into the Company, and the

forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.3 _Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Directors and Officers_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving

incorporation of AcquisitionCo (as in effect immediately prior to the

follows: "The name of the Corporation is Gilead Connecticut, Inc."
Such certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and applicable Requirements of Law.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to be identical to the bylaws of AcquisitionCo (as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time), except that such bylaws shall
reflect that the name of the Surviving Corporation is "Gilead Connecticut,
Inc." Such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until

Section 2.1 _Conversion Terms_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any stockholder of the Company
or AcquisitionCo:

(a) _AcquisitionCo Stock_. Each share of common stock of AcquisitionCo issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Treasury Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock that immediately prior to the Effective Time are held in the treasury
of the Company, if any, shall be canceled and retired. No capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation, cash or other consideration shall be paid or delivered
in exchange for any such Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held
in treasury, and the Merger shall effect no conversion thereof.

(c) _Company Capital Stock_. 

(i) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Dissenters Shares and shares to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.2(b)) shall be converted into and become the right to receive (A) such
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration as the applicable Share is
entitled to receive pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Company Charter
(as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time), and (B) such portion
of any Contingent Merger Consideration as the applicable Share is entitled to
receive pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Company Charter (as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time).

(ii) All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired.

(d) _Escrow_. 

(i) _Contingent Escrow_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
2.1(c), if and when any Contingent Merger Consideration is payable pursuant

that is after the period ending [*] from the Closing Date, (y) there are no
Indemnity Claims pursuant to Section 12.1 pending as of such date and (z) as
of such date there have never been at any time any Indemnity Claims pursuant
to Section 12.1 that were not paid in full to Parent Group Members solely
because the amount of such claims exceeded the amount of funds in the Escrow
Fund,

 



 

3  then no amounts shall be deposited into the Escrow Fund in respect of the
Contingent Purchase Price then payable.

 

(C) If (x) such Contingent Merger Consideration has become payable on a date
that is after the period ending [*] from the Closing Date and as of such date
and (y)(1) there are any Indemnity Claims properly made pursuant to Section
12.1 pending as of such date, then [*] of the Contingent Purchase Price then
payable (or, if less, the Outstanding Claims Reserve Shortfall (as defined in
the Escrow Agreement)) shall be deposited into the Escrow Fund or (2) there
have been at any time any Indemnity Claims properly made pursuant to Section
12.1 that were not paid in full to Parent Group Members solely because the
amount of such claims exceeded the amount of funds in the Escrow Fund, then
the amount of such excess shall be deposited into the Escrow Fund; provided,
however, that the amount deposited into the Escrow Fund pursuant to
this clause (y) shall not exceed in the aggregate [*] of the Contingent
Purchase Price then payable.

Any applicable amounts deposited into the Escrow Fund pursuant to this
Section 2.1(d)(i) are referred to herein as the " _Contingent Escrow Fund
Amount_ ".

 

(ii) _Release of Escrow_. Following the release from the Escrow Fund of any
funds therefrom in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (other than releases
representing indemnity payments pursuant to Section 12.1), such amounts shall
be distributed as follows:

 

(A) there shall be deducted from the applicable amount to be distributed an
amount equal to the sum of the amounts referred to in clauses (b)(i),
(b)(ii), (b)(v) and (b)(vi) in the definition of "Contingent Merger
Consideration" but calculated with respect to such amount then being released
from the Escrow Fund; and then

 

(B) the Management Incentive Payment Amount with respect to such amount then
being released from the Escrow Fund shall be paid pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the 2007 Management Incentive Plan and the Continuing
Chairman Agreement and the Section 409A Letters (each as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time); and

 

(C) the remaining amounts shall be distributed to the Participating Equity
Holders pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Company Charter (as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time).

(e) _Adjustment in Certain Circumstances_. In calculating the consideration
payable under this Section 2.1, Parent and AcquisitionCo shall be entitled to
rely on the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.2. If such
representations and warranties are not correct, Parent shall have the right
to reallocate the distribution of the Merger Consideration among the
Participating Equity Holders accordingly, but without increasing or decreasing
the aggregate Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, except as otherwise provided by Section 4.6(a), the Merger
Consideration payable to the

 



 

4  Participating Equity Holders and members of Company Management shall be
without interest thereon.

 

Section 2.2 _Dissenters  Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Dissenters Shares shall be converted into or represent a right to receive
any of the Merger Consideration, and the holder of Dissenters Shares shall
only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the DGCL.

 

(b) If a holder of Shares who demanded appraisal of such Shares under the DGCL
shall effectively withdraw, forfeit or otherwise lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal of such Shares, then, as of the
occurrence of such event (occurring after the Effective Time), and in each
case subject to and in accordance with Section 3.1, each such Share shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
converted into and represent only the right to receive the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration that such Share is entitled to receive in
accordance with Section 2.1.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of the Shares pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL, withdrawals of such demands and any other related instruments
received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to reasonably
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, no holder of Dissenters Shares shall
be entitled to vote such Shares for any purpose or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on such Shares (except dividends and
distributions payable to holders of record at a date which is prior to the
Effective Time) and, for the avoidance of doubt, it being understood that
where amounts payable hereunder shall be allocated as set forth in the
Company Charter as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
dividends do not continue to accrue after the Effective Time for purposes of
such allocations.

 

Section 2.3 _Specified Expenses_.

 

(a) At any time during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Section 3.1 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) Within two Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall mail or
cause to be mailed a letter of transmittal substantially in the form set
forth on _Exhibit B_ (with such changes as are appropriate to reflect the
matters set forth in Section 2.3) (the " _Transmittal Letter_ ") to each
Participating Equity Holder of record of a certificate for Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ " and, collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") and each
Participating Equity Holder of record of any uncertificated Shares that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares. The
Transmittal Letter shall contain instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and any uncertificated Shares in exchange for
any applicable Closing Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.1(c)(i)(A) to Participating Equity Holders.

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate or uncertificated Share to the Exchange
Agent (other than Dissenters Shares), together with the Transmittal Letter,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
to the holder of such Certificate or uncertificated Shares, subject to
Section 3.7, in exchange for each converted (and canceled) Share represented
thereby, the applicable Closing Merger Consideration payable on account of
such Share pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i)(A). Each Sharing Holder shall be
deemed to have received the entire portion of the Closing Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this paragraph,
notwithstanding the deduction therefrom of its share of the Adjusted
Specified Expense Amount pursuant to Section 2.3.

(c) Contingent upon the prior surrender of a Certificate or uncertificated
Share to the Exchange Agent (other than Dissenters Shares), together with the
Transmittal Letter, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, following the provision of notice by
Parent to the Representative of the achievement of the Contingent Merger
Consideration Milestone pursuant to Section 4.6(a), the Exchange Agent shall
deliver to the holder of such Certificate or uncertificated Shares, subject
to Section 3.7, in exchange for each converted (and canceled) Share
represented thereby, the applicable Contingent Merger Consideration payable on
account of such Share pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i)(B).

 

Section 3.2 _Payments to Persons Not Named in Certificates_. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any Transfer Taxes
or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or



 

6  is not applicable. Subject to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to no longer be outstanding and
automatically be cancelled and retired and represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration that
such Share is entitled to receive in accordance with Section 2.1.

Section 3.3 _No Further Ownership Rights_. The consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article III upon conversion of any Shares
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligations to pay or provide for the rights of holders of Dissenters
Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be exchanged as provided in this Article III.

Section 3.4 _Company Transfer Books; Lost Certificates_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made on the records of
the Company.

(b) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the delivery of an
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent pursuant to
which such Person agrees to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Corporation
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, which agreement will not require a bond or
other security in support of such indemnity obligation unless the Exchange
Agent shall require one (including from Parent) in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, Parent will direct the Exchange Agent to pay
any cash to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.1, all subject to and in accordance with Section 3.1.

Section 3.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Subject to the previous sentence,
if any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to three years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any of the
consideration is payable in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any
cash in respect of such Certificate shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, and the holder of such Certificate shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation and Parent for the consideration payable with
respect to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate.

Section 3.6  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
the Exchange Fund in accordance with the Exchange Agent Agreement. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation. 

Section 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise



 

7  payable to any holder of Shares or Company Warrants or any member of Company
Management pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, to the appropriate
taxing authority and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Company Warrants or any
member of Company Management in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

 

Section 3.8 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall be changed into a different
number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-
up, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or
other securities is declared thereon with a record date within such period,
or any similar event shall occur, the consideration payable per Share will be
adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or
dividend or similar event.

As an inducement to Parent and AcquisitionCo to enter into this Agreement and

represents and warrants to Parent and AcquisitionCo as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date and agrees as set forth in this Article V, subject to
the qualifications set forth in the written disclosure schedules attached
hereto (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ "). The Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in sections and subsections corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and subsections contained in this Article V. The disclosure
in any section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule shall qualify other
sections and subsections in this Article V to the extent that (a) disclosure
in one subsection of the Disclosure Schedule is specifically referred to in
another subsection of the Disclosure Schedule by appropriate cross-reference
or (b) the relevance of a disclosure in one subsection of the Disclosure

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly
qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each of the jurisdictions listed on Schedule 5.1(a), which
jurisdictions are the only jurisdictions in which the ownership or leasing of
the Companys properties or the conduct of the Companys business requires
such qualification, except where the lack of such qualification would not have
a Material Adverse Effect. No other jurisdiction has demanded, requested or
otherwise indicated that the Company is required to so qualify. The Company
has full corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted. The Company has delivered to Parent true and
complete copies of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and the Companys
minute books, and such minute books contain true and complete records of all
meetings and other corporate actions taken by the board of directors and
stockholders of the Company.

Ancillary Agreements, (ii) approved the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, (iii) determined that
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Company Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and

adopt this Agreement, the Company Ancillary Agreements and the Merger, and (v)
directed that this Agreement, the Company Ancillary Agreements and the Merger
be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their approval
and adoption. The special committee of the board of directors of the Company
(consisting solely of an independent, disinterested director and formed for
purpose of issuing its recommendation to the board concerning the Merger) has
recommended to the board of directors of the Company that it proceed with the
Merger. Except



 

14  for the adoption of this Agreement by the Necessary Stockholder Approval and
the filing contemplated by Section 4.2(b), no other corporate proceedings on
the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the
Company Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Company and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by each of Parent, AcquisitionCo and the Representative) is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance
with its terms, and each of the Company Ancillary Agreements has been duly
authorized by the Company and upon execution and delivery by the Company will
be (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery by each of the
other parties thereto) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable in accordance with its terms, in each case, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general principles of
equity (the " _General Exceptions_ ").

(a) The Company shall, through its board of directors, recommend to its
Stockholders approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall in no way limit the obligations of the
Companys board of directors to provide full and accurate disclosure of all
developments to its Stockholders if the board of directors determine
(after consultation with its independent legal counsel) that such disclosure
is required in order for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary
duties under Delaware law.

 

(b) Promptly following the execution and delivery hereof, the Company shall
prepare and distribute to Stockholders holding at least the number and class
of Shares sufficient to provide the Necessary Stockholder Approval an
irrevocable written consent of Stockholders approving the Merger and adopting
this Agreement and waiving any appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect thereto and waiving (pursuant to Sections 8.23 and 9.3 of
the Company Stockholders Agreement) the right of each holder of Series C
Preferred Stock to receive advance notice of written consent pursuant to
Section 8.23 of the Company Stockholder Agreement (such waiver, being
referred to herein as the " _Notice Waiver_ "), in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent (the " _Written Consent_ ") in accordance with the
applicable Requirements of Law, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and
the Company Stockholders Agreement. Subject to Section 8.12(d), the Company
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Stockholders to

Stockholders sufficient to satisfy the Necessary Stockholder Approval, the
Surviving Corporation shall, in accordance with applicable Requirements of
Law, including Section 228 and 262 of the DGCL, the Company Charter, the

taken by less than unanimous written consent of the Stockholders, (ii) this
Agreement and the Merger was approved and (iii) appraisal rights are
available pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Such notice shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall at all relevant times be in
compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL and Requirements of Law.

of AcquisitionCo, shall take such actions as may be necessary to approve the

properties, employees and business and financial records (including computer
files, retrieval programs and similar documentation and such access and
information that may be necessary in connection with an environmental audit)
of the Company to the extent Parent shall reasonably deem necessary or
desirable and shall furnish to Parent or its authorized representatives such
additional information concerning the Company as shall be reasonably
requested, including all such information as shall be necessary to enable

Parent agrees that such investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as
to not interfere unreasonably with the operations of the Company.

Section 8.4 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each party hereto shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto of any Action that shall be

Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company that would have been
listed on _Schedule 5.13_ if such lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation
had arisen prior to the date hereof and (b) any other event or matter that
becomes known to the Company and would cause any other representation or
warranty contained in Article V to be untrue in any material respect or any
covenant contained in this Agreement to be breached in any material respect.
Any notification, and any information received by Parent, pursuant to Section
8.3 or this Section 8.4, shall not constitute a waiver by Parent of any
rights it may have under this Agreement.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 9.1 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_. Pursuant to Article XII, and solely from the Escrow
Fund, each Parent Group Member shall be indemnified and held harmless from
and against, any and all Losses and Expenses suffered, incurred or sustained
by any such Parent Group Member relating to, in connection with or arising
from (i) all Taxes imposed on the Company, or for which the Company may
otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member of a Company Group
(including Taxes for which the Company may be liable pursuant to Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local or foreign law as a result of
having been a member of a Company Group) on or prior to the Effective Date,
(ii) all Transfer Taxes imposed on the Participating Equity Holders, and (iii)
all Taxes imposed on the Company, or for which the Company may otherwise be
liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Effective
Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Effective Date (including, without
limitation, any obligations to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined
on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to any Company
Group); [*]. For purposes of this Section 9.1(a), whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for income or sales Taxes of the Company for a
Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company for the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after, the Effective Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods,
one which ended at the close of the Effective Date and the other which began
at the beginning of the day following the Effective Date and items of income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company for the Straddle Period shall
be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the
books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the
close of the Effective Date and the amount of any other Taxes of the Company
shall be allocated between such two taxable years based upon a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the year being
determined and denominator of which is the number of days in the year. In the
event that Parent makes an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect
to the acquisition of the Company hereunder, then the deemed sale by the
Company of its assets pursuant to such election shall be treated for purposes
of this Section 9.1(a) as having taken place after the Effective Date. Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Participating Equity Holders from any
additional Tax recognized by such Participating Equity Holders solely as a
result of such election under Section 338 of the Code.



 

56 (b) _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Effective Date, Representative and
Parent shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (i) timely sign
and deliver such certificates or forms as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to sales, transfer and similar Taxes,
(ii) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other
party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with this Section
9.1, and in connection therewith, provide the other party with any necessary
powers of attorney, (iii) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any
audits of, or disputes with Governmental Bodies regarding, any Tax Returns of
the Company, (iv) make available to the other and to any Governmental Body as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes
of the Company, (v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence
received from any Governmental Body in connection with any Tax audit or
information request with respect to any such taxable period and (vi) cooperate
in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any Transfer Taxes.

(c) _Tax Returns_. The Company shall file or cause to be filed when due
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company on or before the
Effective Date and the Company shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes
due in respect of such Tax Returns. Parent shall prepare and file or cause to
be prepared and filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
the Company and the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Date consistent
with the positions taken, elections made and methods used by the Company in
preparing Tax Returns filed in prior periods to the extent an inconsistent
position would cause the Participating Equity Holders to be liable to
indemnify Parent Group Members pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 9.1,
and Parent shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of
such Tax Returns. Parent shall permit the Representative to review each Tax
Return that covers a pre-Effective Date Tax period or any Straddle Period.
The Representative shall have thirty days to review and comment on each such
Tax Return with respect to items affecting the Tax liabilities of the Company
for which Parent Group Members are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 9.1 prior to the filing thereof and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall make such revisions as reasonably requested by
the Representative. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall,
without the prior written consent of the Representative, file or cause to be
filed an amended Tax Return of file a Tax Return for any Tax period (other
than the initial filing of the Straddle Period return), to the extent that
such filing, if accepted, might change the Tax liability of the Participating
Equity Holders.

(d) _Contest Provisions_.

(i) Parent shall notify Representative in writing upon receipt by Parent, a
Parent Group Member or, after the Effective Date, the Surviving Corporation
of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits or assessments which may materially affect the Tax liabilities of the
Company for which Parent Group Members are entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 9.1; provided, that failure to
comply with this provision shall not affect a Parent Group Members right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure



 

57  materially impairs Representatives ability to contest any such Tax
liabilities on behalf of the Participating Equity Holders.

 

(ii) Subject to paragraph (d)(iii) of this Section 9.1 below, the
Representative shall have the sole right to represent the Surviving
Corporations interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to Tax liabilities for which Parent Group Members are entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 9.1 and which relate to
taxable periods ending on or before the Effective Date, and to employ counsel
of the Representatives choice; provided, however, that the Representative
shall have no right to represent the Surviving Corporations interests in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding unless the Representative
shall have first notified Parent in writing (A) of the Representatives
intention to do so, (B) of the identity of counsel, if any, chosen by the
Representative in connection therewith, and (C) that the Representative agrees
with Parent that the Parent Group Member shall be entitled to indemnification
for any Losses and Expenses relating to Taxes that result from such audit or
proceeding subject to, and in accordance with, Article XII; provided further
that Parent and its representatives shall be permitted, at Parents expense,
to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or
proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative shall not be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect the liability for
Taxes of any Parent Group Member, the Company or any Affiliate thereof for
any period after the Effective Date to any extent without the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(iii) Parent shall have the sole right to represent the Surviving
Corporations interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to Tax liabilities other than those for which the
Representative has such right pursuant to paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section
9.1 and to employ counsel of Parents choice at Parents expense. Parent
shall have the sole right to defend the Surviving Corporation with respect to
any issue arising in connection with any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding to the extent Parent shall have agreed in writing to forego
any indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such issue. Parent
shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after commencement
of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect the liability
for Taxes of the Participating Equity Holders without the prior written
consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(iv) Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Parent any obligation to
defend the Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding,

allow the Representative to initiate a defense of the Company in any Tax audit
or legal proceeding.

 

Section 9.2 _Transferred Employees_.

to the extent permitted under applicable Requirements of Law, including
Requirements of Law relating to the protection of Personal Data and privacy,

information and (ii) the Company shall provide any assistance and information
(including initial employment dates, termination dates, reemployment dates,
hours of service, compensation and Tax withholding history in a form that

connection with the foregoing, and such information shall be true and correct
in all material respects.

or representatives shall make any communication to any employee or
independent contractor regarding any compensation or benefits to be provided
after the Effective Time without the advance written approval of Parent.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement (i) is
intended to create an employment related contract between Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and any employee nor may any current or former employee
rely on this Agreement as the basis for any breach of any employment
related contract claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation; (ii)
shall be deemed or construed to require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
continue to employ any particular employee for any period after the Effective
Time; (iii) shall be deemed or construed to limit the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any employee at any time
after the Effective Time; (iv) shall be construed as establishing or amending

no other person who is not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to
assert any claims hereunder.

(collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ ") with the Parents 401(k) Plan,
the transfer of the assets of the Company 401(k) Plans to the trustee of the
Parents 401(k) Plan and the investment of those assets in comparable
collective investment funds available to participants in the Parents 401(k)
Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a
list of all participants in the Company 401(k) Plans, their account balances
under those plans as of the most recent practicable date, the investment funds
in which each account balance is invested, including the dollar amount

transfer. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to

shall be indemnified and held harmless under Section 12.1 (including any
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1) exceed an amount equal to [*].

(b) The indemnification provided for in this Section 12.1 shall terminate [*]
after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by any Parent Group Member
under this Section 12.1 thereafter), except that indemnification of Parent
Group Members shall continue as to any claim of which any Parent Group Member
has notified the Representative in accordance with the requirements of Section
12.3 on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in
accordance with this Section 12.1, as to which the right of the Parent Group
Member to be indemnified shall continue until the liability shall have been
determined pursuant to this Article XII, and all Parent Group Members shall
have been reimbursed for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in
accordance with this Article XII. The Parent Group Members shall be entitled
to the indemnification provided for under this Section 12.1 even if any of
them had knowledge at any time of the matter that is later the subject of a
claim for indemnity.

(c) The limitations on indemnification contained in Section 12.1(a)
and Section 12.1(b) shall not apply in the case of fraud or willful
misconduct; _provided_ that in no event shall the aggregate amount for which
Parent Group Members shall be indemnified and held harmless in the case of
fraud or willful misconduct under Section 12.1 exceed the Merger
Consideration.

Section 12.2 _Indemnification of Participating Equity Holders_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article XII, from and after the
Effective Time, each Participating Equity Holder shall be indemnified and
held harmless by Parent from and against any and all Losses and Expenses
incurred by any such Participating Equity Holder in connection with or arising
from:

 



 

66 (i) any breach by Parent or AcquisitionCo of any of its covenants
or agreements, or any failure by Parent or AcquisitionCo to perform any of
its obligations, in this Agreement, any Parent Ancillary Agreement or any
AcquisitionCo Ancillary Agreement; or

 

(ii) any breach of any warranty or inaccuracy of any representation of Parent
or AcquisitionCo contained or referred to in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered by or on behalf of Parent or AcquisitionCo pursuant
hereto (for purposes of calculating any Losses and Expenses arising from such
breach or inaccuracy, each such representation and warranty shall be read as
if it were not qualified by any concept of "material," "materiality," Material
Adverse Effect or a similar qualification);

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that

 

(A) Parent shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless under clause
(ii) of this sentence with respect to Losses and Expenses incurred by
Participating Equity Holders (other than Losses and Expenses incurred as a
result of any inaccuracies of the representations or any breaches of the
warranties contained in Section [*]) unless the aggregate amount of such
Losses and Expenses subject to indemnification exceeds the Basket Amount, and
once the Basket Amount is exceeded, Participating Equity Holders shall be
indemnified and held harmless [*]; and

 

(B) except with respect to breaches of Sections [*], in no event shall the
aggregate amount that Participating Equity Holders shall be indemnified and
held harmless for under this Section 12.2 exceed an amount equal to [*].

(b) The indemnification provided for in this Section 12.2 shall terminate [*]
after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by any Participating
Equity Holder under this Section 12.2 thereafter), except that the
indemnification of Participating Equity Holders shall continue as to any
claim of which any Participating Equity Holder has notified the Representative
in accordance with the requirements of Section 12.3 on or prior to the date
such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with this
Section 12.2, as to which the right of the Participating Equity Holder to be
indemnified shall continue until the liability shall have been determined
pursuant to this Article XII, and all Participating Equity Holders shall have
been reimbursed for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in accordance
with this Article XII.

 

(c) The limitations on indemnification contained in Section 12.2(a) and
Section 12.2(b) shall not apply in the case of fraud or willful misconduct;
_provided_ that in no event shall the aggregate amount for which Participating
Equity Holders shall be indemnified and held harmless in the case of fraud or
willful misconduct under Section 12.2 exceed the Merger Consideration.

Section 12.3 _Notice of Claims_.

 

(a) Any Parent Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder shall give to
the Representative, and any Participating Equity Holder seeking
indemnification hereunder



 

67  shall give to Parent, prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim and
a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other Contract, document
or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such
claim is based. A Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in
equity by or against a Person that is not (i) a party to this Agreement, (ii)
a Parent Group Member or (iii) a Participating Equity Holder (each, a "
_Third Person_ ") as to which indemnification will be sought (each, a "
_Third-Person Claim_ ") shall be given promptly after the action or suit is
commenced. The failure of any Parent Group Member or Participating Equity
Holder seeking indemnification hereunder (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to
give the Claim Notice to the party against whom a claim for indemnification is
being asserted (each, an " _Indemnitor_ ") promptly as required by this
Section 12.3 shall not affect such Indemnified Partys rights under this
Article XII except to the extent such failure is actually prejudicial to the
rights and obligations of the party obligated to provide indemnification to
such Indemnified Party. For the purposes of this Article XII, the term
"Indemnitor" shall refer to the Representative, if and to the extent that a
claim for indemnification is being asserted with respect to the Escrow Fund.

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Article XII shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by an Award. The judgment or
decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any,
shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals
taken shall have been finally determined.

 

(c) If any Claim Notice, written agreement between the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnitor, final judgment or decree of any court or any Award is
delivered to a party pursuant to this Section 12.3, a copy of such Claim
Notice, written agreement, final judgment or decree or Award shall be
delivered promptly to the Escrow Agent. Upon the determination of any amount
of indemnification payable to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
12.3(b), if cash remains in the Escrow Fund, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent to act in accordance with
such written agreement, final judgment or decree or Award and distribute cash
from the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.

fraud or willful misconduct, if the Closing occurs, this Article XII shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for breach of, or inaccuracy in,
any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein, or otherwise in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto hereby
waive, from and after the Closing, any and all other remedies which may be
available at law or equity for any breach or inaccuracy or alleged breach of,

in any certificate delivered with respect hereto) and any liability for breach
of any covenant or obligation contained in Articles VIII and IX, other than
the covenants and obligations set forth in Sections 9.4 and 9.5, shall
terminate on the date that is [*] after the Closing Date. Except as otherwise
provided herein, no claim shall be made for the breach of any representation

it shall have obtained regarding the other parties hereto during the course of
the negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), the

70  and other related documents, and, in the event the transactions contemplated

counsel, accountants or financial advisors). No other party shall use any
confidential information in any manner whatsoever except solely for

the Effective Time Parent and the Surviving Corporation may use or disclose
any confidential information reasonably related to the Company or its assets

advised and the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a
mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary
to implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with accounting
and Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations.

Section 14.5 _Successors and Assigns_.

 

(a) The rights of each party hereto under this Agreement shall not be
assignable by such party hereto prior to the Effective Time without the
written consent of the other parties hereto, except that the rights of Parent
hereunder may be assigned prior to the Effective Time, without the consent of
any other party hereto, to any corporation all of the outstanding capital
stock of which is owned or controlled by Parent, to any limited liability
company of which Parent or any such corporation owns or controls all
membership interests or to any general or limited partnership in which Parent
or any such corporation is a general partner; _provided_ that (i) the
assignee shall assume in writing all of Parents obligations hereunder and
(ii) Parent shall not be released from any of its obligations hereunder by
reason of such assignment. Following the Effective Time, any party hereto may
assign any of its rights hereunder, but no such assignment shall relieve it of
its obligations hereunder.

 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. The successors and
permitted assigns hereunder shall include, in the case of Parent, any
permitted assignee as well as the successors in interest to such permitted
assignee (whether by merger, liquidation (including successive mergers or
liquidations) or otherwise). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the
parties, their successors and assigns permitted by this Section 14.5 and any
Indemnified Party) that is not a party hereto any right, remedy or claim
under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 14.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_.

(a) This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein, and the
documents delivered pursuant hereto or thereto contain the entirety of the
agreements, understandings, covenants, representations and warranties of the
parties hereto and thereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein
or therein, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, covenants,
representations, warranties or the letters of intent between or among any of
the parties hereto, other than the Confidentiality Agreements. As of the
Effective Time, this Agreement shall supersede the
Confidentiality Agreements. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that (i) there are no representations or warranties other than those
expressly set forth in this Agreement; and (ii) in respect of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, it has performed its own due
diligence investigation of the other party.

(b) This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a
written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ that, from and after the time the
Necessary Stockholder Approval has been obtained and prior to the Effective
Time, any such amendment or waiver that, in accordance with the DGCL, requires
consent of the Stockholders shall be effective only to the extent such
Stockholder approval has been obtained for such amendment or waiver (with it
being understood and agreed that, to the maximum extent permitted under the
DGCL, any amendment or waiver of this Agreement shall be effective without the
requirement that such Stockholder approval for 



 

73  such amendment or waiver be obtained). No course of dealing between or among
any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to
modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 14.7  _Interpretation_. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words
"include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation," (b) the word "or" is not exclusive, (c) the words
"herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement
as a whole and (d) the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not
mean simply "if". Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein:
(i) to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules mean the Articles and
Sections of and the Exhibits and Schedules attached to this Agreement; (ii) to
a Contract, instrument or other document means such Contract, instrument or
other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the
extent permitted by the provisions thereof and by this Agreement and (iii) to
a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any
successor legislation thereto and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an
integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth
verbatim herein. Titles to Articles and headings of Sections are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of or to affect
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. This Agreement, the Parent
Ancillary Agreements, the Company Ancillary Agreements and the Representative
Ancillary Agreements shall be construed without regard to any presumption or
rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an
instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted.

 

Section 14.8 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is (and only if it is) authorized in writing by an
authorized representative of such party. The failure of any party hereto to
enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to
be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce
each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall
be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

 

Section 14.9 _Expenses_. Each of the parties hereto shall bear its own costs
and expenses (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, accountants,
investment bankers and other financial, legal, accounting or other advisors),
incurred by it or its Affiliates in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each
of the other documents and instruments executed in connection with or
contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the process relating to the sale of the
Company (collectively, the " _Transaction Costs_ ").

Section 14.10 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the



 

74  extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction
would be unreasonable.

Section 14.11 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to each of the other parties hereto.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission or PDF by electronic transmission shall be effective
delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 14.12 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Effective
Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of AcquisitionCo,
the Company or otherwise, such deeds and other instruments and to take or
cause to be taken such further or other action as shall be necessary or
desirable in order to vest or perfect in or to confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation title to, and possession of, all of
the property, rights, privileges, powers, immunities and franchises of
AcquisitionCo and the Company and otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

 

Section 14.13 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of
Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that all Disputes shall be resolved by
arbitration pursuant to Section 14.14 except that any request for equity
relief (including interim relief) shall be resolved and all post-Award
proceedings shall be brought in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware or any court of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware and the appellate courts having jurisdiction with respect
to appeals from such courts. In that context, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally:

(i) submits for itself and its property in any Action relating to this
Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware or any court of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware, and appellate courts having jurisdiction with respect
to appeals from any of the foregoing, and agrees that all claims in respect of
any such Action shall be heard and determined in such Delaware State court or,
to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court;

(ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue or
jurisdiction of any such Action in any such court or that such Action was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

 



 

75 (iii) waives all right to trial by jury in any Action (whether based
on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
or its performance under or the enforcement of this Agreement;

 

(iv) agrees that service of process in any such Action may be effected by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address as
provided in Section 14.4; and

 

(v) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the laws of the State of
Delaware.

Section 14.14 _Resolution of Disputes_.

 

(a) Except with respect to any request for equitable relief (including interim
relief) by any party hereto as contemplated by Section 14.14(e), any dispute,
controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
validity, interpretation, breach or termination of this Agreement, including
claims seeking redress or asserting rights under any Requirements of Law (a "
_Dispute_ "), that the parties are not able to resolve within 10 Business Days
of the commencement of discussions to resolve such Dispute, shall be resolved
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 14.14.

(b) If, after the procedures set forth in Section 14.14(a) have been followed,
there has been no resolution of the Dispute, then any party hereto may seek
resolution of the Dispute through binding arbitration administered by the
American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") in accordance with its Commercial
Arbitration Rules by three arbitrators, of whom each of Parent and the
Representative shall designate one in accordance with the "screened"
appointment procedure provided in Rule 13 of such rules and the third
arbitrator shall be designated as provided in such rules. The place of the
arbitration shall be New York, New York, and the arbitration shall be
conducted in the English language in a single hearing conducted on consecutive
days. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.

(c) A hearing before the arbitrators so appointed shall be held within ninety
days after the appointment of the third arbitrator. Post-hearing briefs shall
be submitted by the parties within ten days after the end of such hearing, and
the arbitrators shall render their award (the " _Award_ ") no later than
thirty days after the end of such hearing. Disputes about arbitration
procedure shall be resolved by the arbitrators or, failing agreement, by the
AAA. The arbitrators may proceed to the Award notwithstanding the failure of
any party to participate in the proceedings. Limited discovery shall be
permitted as mutually agreed to by Parent and the Representative. At a minimum
each side expressly agrees to the mutual exchange by the parties and their
Affiliates of documents directly relevant and likely to lead to admissible
evidence regarding the dispute, controversy or claim in the arbitration
proceeding. All requests for such documents shall be required to be submitted
to the other party within forty-five days after the third arbitrator is
appointed, as described in Section 14.14(b). Each party shall have thirty
days to respond to such requests. Document production may be further limited,
at the discretion of the arbitrators. Depositions shall be limited to five per
party, and each deposition shall not be longer than seven hours, unless
otherwise ordered by the arbitrators or stipulated by the parties. The

 



 

76  arbitrators shall be authorized to grant interim relief, including to
prevent the destruction of goods or documents involved in the dispute, protect
technology and provide for security for a prospective monetary award.

(d) The arbitrators shall be empowered to award damages in accordance with
applicable law governing the Dispute. The arbitrators shall have no power or
authority, under the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules or otherwise, to relieve
the parties from their agreement hereunder to arbitrate or otherwise to amend
or disregard any provision of this Agreement, including the provisions of
this Section 14.14. The cost of the arbitration, including the fees and
expenses of the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by (i) Parent and (ii) the
Company (if the Dispute is submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to
Section 14.14(b) prior to the Closing) or the Representative (if the Dispute
is submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to Section 14.14(b) following the
Closing); _provided_ that (x) such costs borne by Parent shall be recoverable
by it under Section 12.1 in connection with matters indemnified thereunder and
(y) such costs borne by the Representative or any Participating Equity Holder
shall be recoverable by it under Section 12.2 in connection with matters
indemnified thereunder. The Award shall be presented to the parties in
