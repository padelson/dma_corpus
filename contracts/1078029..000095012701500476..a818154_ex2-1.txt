Board of Directors under applicable Law.   (b) Neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify
or amend, or propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to

or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that the Company may recommend to its shareholders an Acquisition
Proposal and, in connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or

the Board of Directors of the Company has determined, in good faith, after
receiving advice from Netherlands Antilles counsel to the Company, that it is

class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y)
five percent (5%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any Person beneficially owning any class of equity securities

-26-    merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any other transaction the consummation of which
could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
that could reasonably be expected to dilute materially the benefits to
Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby.   "Superior Proposal"
shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a third party to
acquire either all of the Company Shares or the Shares or substantially all
of the combined assets of the Operating Subsidiaries and their respective

(after consultation with an independent, nationally recognized investment
bank) reasonably determines in good faith to be more favorable, from a
financial point of view, to the Company and its shareholders (in their
capacity as such) than the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) that is
reasonably capable of being consummated (taking into account, among other
things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal
and the identity of the Person making such proposal).   (c) In addition to
the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraph (a) above, promptly
after receipt or occurrence thereof, the Company shall advise Purchaser of
any request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or of
any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal, discussions or
negotiation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, discussion or negotiation and the Company shall, promptly after
receipt thereof, provide to Purchaser copies of any written materials
received by the Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and the
identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or such request,
inquiry or proposal or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking
place.   Section 5.6 Notification of Certain Matters. Purchaser and the
Company shall promptly notify each other of the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any fact or event that has caused or could reasonably be expected to cause
(a) any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to
the Closing, or (b) any covenant, condition or agreement under this Agreement
not to be complied with or satisfied by it in any material respect; provided,
however, that no such notification shall modify the representations or
warranties of any party or the conditions to the obligations of any party
hereunder.   Section 5.7 Antitrust. (a) Each party hereto shall promptly
take all actions necessary to make the filings required of it or any of its
Affiliates under any applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with this

Antitrust Laws and in connection   -27-    with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement initiated by any Antitrust Authority.   (b) Each party hereto
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall include:   (i) in the
case of each of Purchaser and the Company, if  Purchaser or the Company
receives a formal request for additional  information or documentary material
from an Antitrust Authority,  substantially complying with such formal
request within a reasonable  period of time following the date of its receipt
thereof;   (ii) in the case of the Company only, subject to the compliance

commercially reasonable efforts to (x) defend against any lawsuits,  actions
or proceedings, judicial or administrative, challenging this  Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;  (y) seek to
prevent the entry or imposition of any preliminary  injunction, temporary
restraining order, stay or other legal restraint  or prohibition by any

prohibition that is not yet final  and nonappealable.  The parties agree
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be obligated by this
Agreement to hold separate, divest, license or cause a third party to
purchase assets and/or businesses of any Operating Subsidiary or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.   (c) Each
party hereto shall promptly inform the other parties of any material
communication made to, or received by such party from, any
Antitrust Authority or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 5.8 Employee Benefits. (a)
During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Purchaser shall cause the current and former employees
of the Operating Subsidiaries and their respective Subsidiaries who are, on
the Closing Date, entitled to receive compensation or any benefits from any
Operating Subsidiary or any of their respective Subsidiaries to be provided
with compensation and employee benefit plans (other than stock option or
other plans involving the potential issuance of securities of any Operating
Subsidiary, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries) that in the
aggregate are not materially less favorable than those currently provided to
such employees by the Operating Subsidiaries and their
respective Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 5.8(a) shall not
create in any current or former employee of any Operating Subsidiary or any
of their   -28-     respective Subsidiaries any rights to employment or
continued employment with Purchaser or any Operating Subsidiary or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any right to specific terms or
conditions of employment.   (b) The parties hereto agree that, upon the
Closing, a "change in control", "change of control" or "consolidation" as
applicable, shall be deemed to have occurred in respect of each of the
employment agreements, change in control agreements and severance agreements
and other employee benefit plans and agreements set forth on Schedule 5.8(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Severance Protection
Plans"). This Section 5.8(b) shall not affect any terms of, or otherwise
imply that the Closing or any other termination shall not constitute a
"change in control" or "change of control" under, any employment agreement,
change in control agreement, severance agreement or other employee benefit
plan or agreement that is not listed on such Schedule 5.8(b).   (c) From
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Operating Subsidiaries and
their respective Subsidiaries to (i) pay and perform the respective
obligations of the Operating Subsidiaries and their respective Subsidiaries
under the Severance Protection Plans and (ii) take such action as may be
necessary to pay promptly any severance payments or other amounts from time
to time due thereunder.   (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 5.8, no employee of any Operating Subsidiary or any of their
Subsidiaries shall have any continued right to employment with any Operating
Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of any Operating Subsidiary following the
Closing, except as provided in writing by Purchaser; provided, that nothing
in this Section 5.8(d) shall affect the rights of any employee pursuant to
any employment Contract.   Section 5.9 Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance
and Indemnification. (a) The provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation from liability set forth in the respective organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years after the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were
directors or officers of the Subsidiaries of the Company, unless such
modification is required by Law.   (b) For a period of six (6) years
following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Operating Subsidiaries to
either (i) maintain in effect the current directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance of the Company covering (x) those Persons who are
currently covered as directors or officers of any Subsidiary of the Company
on the date of this Agreement by the directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy of the Company (a copy of which has been heretofore
delivered to Purchaser) (the "Subsidiary Indemnified Parties") and (y) those
Persons who are currently covered as directors or officers of the Company on
the date of this Agreement by the directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy of the Company (the "Company Indemnified
Parties"); provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser be required to
expend, on an annualized basis, an amount in excess of two hundred percent
(200%) of the annualized premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance, which the Company represents to be two hundred and five thousand
($205,000) for the twelve   -29-     (12) month period ending on March
31, 2002; provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Purchaser shall cause the Operating Subsidiaries
to obtain a policy or, as the case may be, policies, with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and provided,
further, that Purchaser may substitute or, as the case may be, cause to be
substituted for such policies other policies with at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous, and provided
that said substitution does not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing, or (ii) cause directors\'
and officers\' liability insurance of Purchaser then in effect to cover the
Company Indemnified Parties and the Subsidiary Indemnified Parties with
respect to those matters covered by the directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy of the Company so long as the terms thereof are no
less advantageous to the Company Indemnified Parties and the Subsidiary
Indemnified Parties than the current directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance of the Company covering the Company Indemnified Parties and the
Subsidiary Indemnified Parties.   (c) The Operating Subsidiaries shall and,
if, at any time after the Closing, any Operating Subsidiary or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be liquidated, dissolved or wound up,
Purchaser, or a Person designated by Purchaser that has a net worth at least
equal to that of the liquidated, dissolved or, as the case may be, wound up,
Operating Subsidiary at the time of such liquidation, dissolution or, as the
case may be, winding up (the "Substitute Party"), shall indemnify all
Subsidiary Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law with respect to all acts and omissions prior to the Closing arising out
of such individuals\' services as officers, directors, employees or agents of
any Subsidiary of the Company or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for
the benefit of employees of any Subsidiary of the Company including, without
limitation, the execution of, and the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, in the event any such
Subsidiary Indemnified Party is or becomes involved, in any capacity, in any
action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any matter occurring
prior to and including the time of the Closing, including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Operating
Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as the case may be, the Substitute Party, shall
pay, as incurred, the reasonable legal and other expenses of such Subsidiary
Indemnified Party (including the cost of any investigation and preparation)
incurred in connection therewith. Subject to Section 5.9(d) below, the
Operating Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as the case may be, the Substitute
Party, shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys\' fees, that
may be incurred by any Subsidiary Indemnified Party in enforcing this Section
5.9 or any action involving a Subsidiary Indemnified Party resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) Any Subsidiary
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 5.9(a), upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall
promptly notify the Operating Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as the case may be,
the Substitute Party, thereof. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (i) the Operating Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as
the case may be, the Substitute Party, shall have the right, from and after
the Closing, to assume the defense thereof (with counsel engaged by the
Operating Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as the case may be, the Substitute
Party, to be reasonably acceptable to the relevant Subsidiary Indemnified
Party), and none of the Operating Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as the case may
be, the Substitute Party, shall be liable to such Subsidiary Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses  
-30-     subsequently incurred by such Subsidiary Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof, (ii) such Subsidiary Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) none of the
Operating Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as the case may be, the Substitute
Party, shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided, that none of the Operating Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as
the case may be, the Substitute Party shall have any obligation hereunder to
any Subsidiary Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Subsidiary Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. None of
the Operating Subsidiaries, Purchaser or, as the case may be, the Substitute
Party shall enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each
Subsidiary Indemnified Party a release from all liability in respect of such
matter.   (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations
of Purchaser, the Operating Subsidiaries and the Substitute Party contained
in this Section 5.9 shall be binding upon their respective successors and
assigns. In the event Purchaser, any Operating Subsidiary, the Substitute
Party or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or
amalgamates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Section 5.9.   (f) The obligations of Purchaser, the Operating Subsidiaries
and the Substitute Party and their respective Subsidiaries under this Section
5.9 shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to affect adversely any Company Indemnified Party or any
Subsidiary Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.9 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that
the Company Indemnified Parties and Subsidiary Indemnified Parties to whom
this Section 5.9 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section
5.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section).   Section
5.10 Public Announcements. Purchaser and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation and review by the other party of such release or
statement, or without the prior consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other
party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be
required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange or automated quotation system to which Purchaser or any Affiliate of

delivered to Purchaser a copy of the shareregister of each Subsidiary of the
Company that is organized under the laws of the Netherlands Antilles, in each
case certified by the requisite number of the members of the board of
directors of such Subsidiary and showing the information thereon with respect
to such Subsidiary to be as represented in Section 3.3, the representations

their intention that, for purposes of determining whether the condition set
forth in the first sentence of this Section 6.1(b) has been satisfied, all
materiality qualifications set forth in the representations and warranties of
the Company in this Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 3.6(a),
3.15 and 3.22 and the first and third sentences of Section 3.5) shall be
deemed to be deleted from such representations and warranties and the truth
and correctness of such representations and warranties shall be determined as

Closing Date as though made on or as of such date (other than representations
and warranties that, by their terms, address matters only as of another
specified date, which shall be true and correct only as of such other
specified date), other than any such failures to be true and correct that, in

Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge that it is their intention that, for purposes of determining

has been satisfied, all materiality qualifications set forth in the
representations and warranties of Purchaser in this Agreement (other than

Company is the party attempting to terminate this  Agreement;   (c) by the

of Directors under applicable Law; provided, however, that (x) prior to such
termination, Purchaser has received the payment required by Section 8.1(b) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds and (y) simultaneously or
substantially simultaneously with such termination the Company enters into a
definitive acquisition, merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or similar
agreement to effect the Superior Proposal; or   (d) by Purchaser at any
time prior to the Closing, if:   (i) the Company shall have (x) withdrawn,
modified or amended in  a manner adverse to Purchaser, the approval, adoption
or  recommendation, as the case may be, of the relevant Proposals or (y) 
approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal; or   (ii) there shall have

Investigation and Agreement; Projections; No Other Representations and
Warranties. (a) Each of Purchaser and the Company acknowledges and agrees
that it has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon,
has formed an independent judgment concerning, the other party and its
Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, and such party has
requested and received such documents and information from the other party as

be terminated and extinguished by, the Closing, and thereafter neither the
Company nor Purchaser shall be under any liability whatsoever with respect to
any such representation or warranty. This Section 8.2(b) shall have no effect
upon any other obligation of the parties hereto.   (c) In connection with

uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans and budgets; that it is familiar with such uncertainties;
that it is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and
budgets so furnished to it or its representatives; and that it will not (and
will cause all of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates or any other person
acting on its behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of action against any
of the direct or indirect partners, directors, officers,
employees, shareholders or Affiliates of the Company with respect thereto, or
hold any such person liable with respect thereto.   (d) Purchaser and the
Company agree that, except for the representations and warranties made by the
other party that are expressly set forth herein, neither the other party nor

have made to such party or to any of its representatives or Affiliates any
representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each party agrees that neither the other party nor any of its
Affiliates makes or has made any representation or warranty to such party or
to any of its representatives or Affiliates with respect to:   (i) any
