PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES   2.1. Purchase and Sale of Shares.   Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in  reliance on the
covenants, representations and warranties of Buyer  and Parent contained
herein, contemporaneously with execution of  this Agreement, Shareholder is,
or is causing its Subsidiaries to,  hereby sell, convey, transfer, assign and
deliver to Buyer or any  nominee the Shares, with all appropriate transfer
Tax stamps  affixed, free and clear of all Liens, and Buyer, in reliance on
the  covenants, representations and warranties of Shareholder contained 
herein, is purchasing and acquiring from Shareholder and its  Subsidiaries
the Shares. From and after the date hereof, none of  Shareholder or its
Affiliates shall have any rights with respect to  any of the Shares and all
of the Shares shall be owned and  registered solely in the name of Buyer or
any nominee.   2.2. Purchase Price.   2.2.1. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and in  reliance on the covenants,
representations and warranties of  Shareholder contained herein, in
consideration for the sale,  conveyance, transfer and assignment of the
Shares by  Shareholder and its Subsidiaries to Buyer or any nominee, 
contemporaneously with execution of this Agreement, Buyer is  paying
Shareholder the amount in cash of Two Hundred and  Thirty Seven Million,
Eight Hundred and Sixty Four Thousand,  Two Hundred and Thirty One dollars
and Twenty Cents  ($237,864,231.20) (the "PURCHASE PRICE"), subject to the 
adjustments as set forth in Section 2.4.   2.2.2. Within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall  deliver to Shareholder a statement (the
"ALLOCATION  STATEMENT") allocating the Purchase Price and applicable 
liabilities among the assets acquired pursuant to this  Agreement, including
the assets of the Companies (and any  Subsidiaries of the Companies) for
which elections are or  will be made under Section 338(h)(10) and Section
338(g) of  the Code and any comparable provisions of state and local  Tax
Laws pursuant to Section 7.5.1. If no changes are  proposed in writing to
Buyer within thirty (30) days after  delivery of the Allocation Statement,
Shareholder shall be  deemed to have agreed to the Allocation Statement. If
within  30 days after delivery of the Allocation Statement,  Shareholder
notifies Buyer in   11   writing that Shareholder objects to an allocation
set forth  in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Shareholder shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute  within thirty (30)
days. If Buyer and Shareholder are unable  to reach agreement within such
time period, such allocation  shall be determined by an appraiser mutually
agreed upon by  Buyer and Shareholder, and the fees and expenses of such 
appraiser shall be borne equally by Buyer and Shareholder.  If the parties
are unable to agree on an appraiser, the  procedures in Section 2.4.4 shall
apply to the selection of  the appraiser and the fees and expenses of the
Dispute  Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer and Shareholder.   2.3.
[Intentionally Reserved]   2.4. Post-Closing Adjustments.   2.4.1. Within
sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement,  Shareholder shall deliver
to Buyer an audited consolidated  and combined balance sheet of the Companies
and their  Subsidiaries dated as of the date of this Agreement (the 
"CLOSING BALANCE SHEET") prepared on a basis consistent with  the Companies
Audited Balance Sheets (as defined below) and  GAAP, in each case except as
provided in Section 2.4.1 of  the Disclosure Schedule. Buyer and its
representatives and  accountants shall grant to Shareholder access as it
may  reasonably request to any books, records, work papers or  other
information of the Companies reasonably related to the  preparation
thereof.   2.4.2. In the event that the Adjusted Working Capital reflected
on  the Closing Balance Sheet is less than the Target Adjusted  Working
Capital by more than Five Hundred Thousand dollars  ($500,000), then
Shareholder shall pay to Buyer on a  dollar-for-dollar basis, by wire
transfer of immediately  available funds, an amount equal to the total amount
by  which Target Adjusted Working Capital exceeds Adjusted  Working Capital.
In the event the Adjusted Working Capital  reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet is greater than the  Target Adjusted Working Capital by more than Five
Hundred  Thousand dollars ($500,000), then the Parent shall cause the  Buyer
to pay to Shareholder, or the Parent shall pay to  Shareholder, an amount
equal to the total amount by which  Adjusted Working Capital exceeds Target
Adjusted Working  Capital, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by wire transfer
of  immediately available funds. Any payments required pursuant  to this
Section 2.4.2 shall be made within ten (10) days  following the receipt by
Buyer of the Closing Balance Sheet,  unless a Dispute Notice (as defined
below) is delivered.  Shareholder and its representatives and accountants
shall  grant to Buyer or Parent access as it may reasonably request  to any
books, records, officers and employees, financial and  operating data,
advisors, auditor and accountant work  papers, or other information in
Shareholder\'s possession as  reasonably required for the review of the
Closing Balance  Sheet and the determination of Adjusted Working
Capital.    12   2.4.3. If, within thirty (30) calendar days after the
date of  receipt by Buyer of the Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer  disputes the
amount of the Adjusted Working Capital  reflected therein, then Buyer will
give written notice to  Shareholder within such thirty (30) calendar day
period  specifying in reasonable detail Buyer\'s basis for its  dispute (a
"DISPUTE NOTICE"). In the event that Buyer  notifies Shareholder in writing
that it has accepted the  Closing Balance Sheet, or in the event that Buyer
does not  issue a Dispute Notice within thirty (30) calendar days of 
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, then the Closing  Balance Sheet shall
become the Final Closing Balance Sheet  (the "FINAL CLOSING BALANCE
SHEET").   2.4.4. If Buyer submits a Dispute Notice to Shareholder within
such  thirty (30) day period, Shareholder and Buyer shall work  together in
good faith to seek to resolve the dispute over  the correct amount of
Adjusted Working Capital. If  Shareholder and Buyer are unable to resolve
their  disagreement within fifteen (15) calendar days after  Shareholder\'s
receipt of a Dispute Notice from Buyer, the  dispute shall be referred for
determination to an Accounting  Firm mutually selected by Shareholder and
Buyer (the  "DISPUTE ACCOUNTANTS") as promptly as practicable. In the  event
that Shareholder and Buyer are unable to agree on the  Dispute Accountants,
then the parties agree to each select a  nationally known firm of independent
public accountants  that, together, will select a third firm of public 
accountants to serve as the Dispute Accountants. The Dispute  Accountants
will make a determination as to the correct  amount of Adjusted Working
Capital, which determination will  be (a) in writing, (b) furnished to each
of Shareholder and  Buyer as promptly as practicable after the dispute has
been  referred to the Dispute Accountants, (c) made in accordance  with this
Agreement and (d) conclusive and binding.  Shareholder and Buyer will use
reasonable commercial efforts  to cause the Dispute Accountants to render
their decision  within thirty (30) calendar days after submitting such 
dispute and shall promptly comply with all reasonable  written requests by
the Dispute Accountants for information,  books, records and similar items.
Neither party will  disclose to the Dispute Accountants, and the Dispute 
Accountants will not consider for any purpose, any  settlement offer made by
either party. As part of the  resolution of all outstanding disputes, the
parties will  cause the Dispute Accountants to prepare the Final Closing 
Balance Sheet, which shall be binding on both parties. Any  payments required
upon the determination by the Dispute  Accountants, together with interest
thereon at a rate equal  to the rate of interest from time to time announced
publicly  by Citibank, N.A., as its prime rate, calculated on the  basis of
the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365,  from the date hereof to
the date of payment, shall be made  within ten (10) days following such
determination.   2.4.5. All fees and expenses charged by any Dispute
Accountants  retained hereunder shall be borne by Buyer and Shareholder  in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters  resolved by the Dispute
Accountants, which proportionate  allocations shall also be determined by the
Dispute   13   Accountants at the time the determination of the Dispute 
Accountants is rendered on the merits of the matters  submitted.  3.

Organization and Authority.   Shareholder and each Subsidiary that directly

SUBSIDIARIES") are duly  organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of  their respective jurisdiction of organization. Shareholder
and each  Relevant Subsidiary have all requisite power and authority, 
corporate or otherwise, to execute and deliver each Transaction  Document to

delivered or to be delivered  thereby and the consummation by Shareholder and
each Relevant  Subsidiary of the Transaction have been duly authorized by
all  necessary and proper action on the part of Shareholder and each 
Relevant Subsidiary, as the case may be. The board of directors or  relevant

Subsidiary, by resolutions duly adopted at meetings duly  called and held or
by the unanimous written consent in lieu of a  meeting, has approved the
Transaction Documents and the transactions  contemplated hereunder and under
the other Transaction Documents.  This Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to be delivered  by Shareholder or the Relevant Subsidiaries have
been duly executed  and delivered thereby and constitute the legal, valid and
binding  obligation thereof, enforceable against Shareholder and the
Relevant  Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance with their
respective  terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating
to  or affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights in general and by 
general principles of equity.    16   4.2. Non-Contravention.   None of
the execution, delivery or performance by Shareholder and  each Relevant
Subsidiary of any Transaction Document to which they  are parties or the
consummation by Shareholder and each Relevant  Subsidiary of the Transaction
does or will, with or without the  giving of notice or the lapse of time or
both conflict with, or  result in a breach or violation of, or a default
under, or give rise  to any other right which may adversely affect the
Transaction or the  Transaction Documents under (i) the certificate of
incorporation or  bylaws of Shareholder or the certificate of incorporation
or  certificate of formation of each Relevant Subsidiary, as the case  may
be, (ii) any Contract to which Shareholder and each Relevant  Subsidiary, as
the case may be, are a party or to which they are  subject, or (iii) any Law
or material License to which Shareholder  and each Relevant Subsidiary, as
the case may be, or its respective  properties or assets are subject, which,
in the case of clauses (ii)  or (iii) hereof, would, or would reasonably be
expected to, result  in a Material Adverse Effect.   4.3. Ownership of
Shares.   Shareholder has good and valid title to and is the legal and 
beneficial owner (either directly or indirectly) of the Shares, free  and
clear of any Liens. Other than the Shares, there are no  outstanding equity

Consents.   No Consent of any Governmental Authority or any other Person
is  required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Shareholder or 
the Relevant Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery  and
performance by Shareholder or the Relevant Subsidiaries of any  Transaction
Document to which any of them is a party or the  consummation by Shareholder
or the Relevant Subsidiaries of the  Transaction (including but not limited
to Consents required in  connection with the change in the control of the
Companies pursuant  to the sale of the Shares by Shareholder and each
Relevant  Subsidiary), other than the Consents of (i) the Major Customers, 
(ii) the Major Suppliers, (iii) the parties to any Material Contract  and
(iv) as otherwise set forth in Section 4.4 of the Disclosure  Schedule (the

of its Affiliates has authorized or  retained any Person to act as an
investment banker, broker, finder  or other intermediary who is or might be
entitled to any fee,  commission or payment from Buyer, Parent or any Company
or on their  behalf in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution or  delivery of any Transaction Document or the consummation of
the  Transaction, nor is there to Shareholder\'s Knowledge any basis for 
any such fee, commission or payment to be claimed by any Person  against
Buyer, Parent or any Company.   17   4.6. Intellectual Property.   None
of Shareholder or its Affiliates (other than the Companies and  any
Subsidiaries thereof) owns (i) Intellectual Property used in the  Cable and
Satellite Business as presently conducted or (ii) the  Principal
Products.  5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SHAREHOLDER RELATING TO THE
COMPANIES   Subject to the disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedule
(provided  that the listing of an item in one section of the Disclosure
Schedule  shall be deemed to be a listing in each section of the Disclosure
Schedule  and to apply to any other representation and warranty of
Shareholder in  this Agreement to the extent that is reasonably apparent from
a reading of  such disclosure item that it would also qualify or apply to
such other  section or representation and warranty), Shareholder hereby
represents and  warrants to Buyer and Parent as follows:   5.1.
Organization.   5.1.1. Interactive is duly organized and validly existing
under the  laws of the State of North Carolina and is in good standing 
under the laws of such state. Innovis is duly organized and  validly existing
under the laws of the State of California  and is in good standing under the
laws of such state. Each  Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to  carry on its business as it is currently conducted and to 
own, lease and operate its assets and properties in the  manner such assets
and properties are now owned, leased or  operated. Each Company is duly
qualified to transact  business and is in good standing as a foreign company
in  each jurisdiction listed in Section 5.1.1 of the Disclosure 
Schedule.   5.1.2. True and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation  certified by the Secretary of State of the state of 
incorporation, bylaws and share certificate books and share  transfer books,
in each case as amended to the date hereof,  of each Company have previously
been delivered or made  available to Buyer. Neither Company is in violation
of any  of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or  bylaws.
Each Company has properly filed or delivered all  reports, resolutions and
other documents that are required  under applicable Laws to be filed with or
delivered to any  Governmental Authority, except where the failure to do so 
would not, or would not reasonably be expected to, result in  a Material
Adverse Effect.   5.1.3. All the minute books of each Company have been
made  available to Buyer. No resolutions have been passed,  enacted,
consented to or adopted by the directors (or any  committee thereof) or
shareholders, except for those  contained in such minute books. The corporate
records of  each Company have been maintained in accordance with all 
applicable Laws and are accurate in all material respects.   5.2.
Authority.   Each Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
to  execute and deliver each Transaction Document delivered or to be 
delivered by it and to   18   perform all of its obligations thereunder.
The Board of Directors of  each Company, by resolutions duly adopted at a
meeting duly called  and held or by the unanimous written consent in lieu of
meeting, has  determined that the Transaction is advisable and has approved
the  Transaction Documents. Each Transaction Document to be delivered by 
each Company has been or will be duly executed and delivered by such  Company
and, when so executed and delivered, will constitute the  legal, valid and
binding obligation thereof, enforceable against it  in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be  limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or  similar laws relating to or
affecting the enforcement of creditors\'  rights in general and by general
principles of equity.   5.3. Non-Contravention; No Material Adverse Effect
Resulting from  Execution and Performance of Agreement.   With respect to
each Company, none of the execution, delivery or  performance by it of any
Transaction Document to which it is party  or the consummation by it of the
Transaction does or will, with or  without the giving of notice or the lapse
of time or both, result in  the creation of any Lien upon any of its assets
or properties, or  conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of, or a
default  under, or trigger any "change of control" right in, or give rise
to  a right of amendment, termination, cancellation or acceleration of  any
obligation under (i) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws  of such
Company, (ii) any Contract to which such Company is party or  (iii) any Law
or License to which such Company or its properties or  assets is subject,
which, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii)  hereof, would, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in a  Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
execution and delivery of this  Agreement by Shareholder or any of the
Companies, the performance or  consummation by any of them of the
transactions contemplated hereby  nor the change of control of the Companies
due to the sale of the  Shares by Shareholder to Buyer will result,
immediately following  consummation of the Transaction, in a Material Adverse
Effect.   5.4. Capitalization; Ownership.   The authorized share capital
of Interactive consists of 50,000  shares of common stock and 50,000 shares

whatsoever of  any Company that are convertible into, exchangeable or
exercisable  for Shares or other capital stock of any Company or that have
the  right to vote (or are convertible into, or exchangeable or  exercisable

Shareholder, no event has  occurred with respect to such Company or such
Subsidiary or  any other Person that (with or without the lapse of time or 
the giving of notice or both) contravenes, conflicts with or  results in a
violation or breach of, or gives such Company  or such Subsidiary or any
other Person the right to declare  a default or exercise any remedy under, or
to accelerate the  maturity of, or to cancel or terminate, any Material 
Contract to which such Company or such Subsidiary is a  party. To the
Knowledge of Shareholder, no party to any  Material Contract has repudiated
any provision thereof since  January 1, 2003. No party to any Material
Contract has  terminated any Material Contract and neither Company nor any 
Subsidiary thereof has received any notice that any other  party or parties
to any Material Contract intend to exercise  any right of cancellation or
termination thereof.   5.13. Insurance.   Each Company and its
Subsidiaries maintains policies of fire and  casualty, liability and other
forms of insurance in such amounts,  with such deductibles and against such
risks and losses as are, in  such Company\'s or such Subsidiary\'s judgment,
reasonable for the  business and assets of each Company, respectively.
Section 5.13 of  the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate
list of  all insurance policies and surety bonds which each Company and its 
Subsidiaries currently maintains through Shareholder with respect to  its
assets, Liabilities, employees, officers, directors or other  representatives
(the "GROUP INSURANCE POLICIES") and all insurance  policies and surety bonds
which each Company and its Subsidiaries  currently maintains in its own name
with respect to its assets,  Liabilities, employees, officers, directors or
other representatives  (together with the Group Insurance Policies, the
"INSURANCE  POLICIES"). Each of the Insurance Policies is in full force and 
effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement; provided  that each
of the Group Insurance Policies shall lapse upon   31   consummation of
the Transaction. Each Company and its Subsidiaries  is current in all
premiums or other payments due under its Insurance  Policies and has
otherwise performed in all material respects all of  its respective
obligations thereunder. Each Company and its  Subsidiaries has given timely
notice to the insurer under each of  its Insurance Policies of all claims
that may be insured thereby.  Neither Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has
received any notice  that any of its Insurance Policies is not in full force
and effect  immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Shareholder has
no  Knowledge of any facts that, under the terms of either Company\'s or  a
Subsidiary\'s thereof Insurance Policies, would cause (or would be 
reasonably likely to cause) any such Insurance Policy not to be in  full
force and effect; provided that each of the Group Insurance  Policies shall
lapse upon consummation of the Transaction. Neither  Company nor any
Subsidiary thereof has received during the past  three years from any
insurance carrier to which it has applied for  any insurance or with which it
has carried any insurance (i) any  refusal of coverage or notice of
limitation of coverage or any  notice that a defense will be afforded with
reservation of rights  (except for limitations standard in the industry) or
(ii) any notice  of cancellation or any other written notice that any
insurance  policy is no longer in full force or effect or will not be
reviewed  or that the issuer of any insurance policy is not willing or able
to  perform its obligations thereunder. No representation or warranty  set
forth in this Section 5.13 shall be construed so as to apply to  any Plan
maintained by either Company or any of their Subsidiaries.   5.14.

either Company  or any director or officer thereof in his or her capacity
as  such is bound, and which relates to such Company or such  Subsidiary,
the assets, properties, Liabilities or employees  of such Company or such
Subsidiary, the business of such  Company or such Subsidiary, any Transaction
Document or the  Transaction and (ii) neither any Company nor any
Subsidiary  thereof is party to or engaged in or, to the Knowledge of 
Shareholder, threatened with any Action which relates to  such Company or
such Subsidiary, the assets, properties,  Liabilities or employees of such
Company or such Subsidiary,  the business of such Company or such Subsidiary,
any  Transaction Document or the Transaction and neither any  Company nor
any Subsidiary thereof has any intention of  initiating any Claim against any
Person.   5.14.2. None of the officers or directors (in their capacities
as  such) of either Company or any Subsidiary thereof is in  default under
or with respect to any judgment, ruling,  order, writ, decree, stipulation,
settlement, injunction or  determination described in Section 5.14.1. None of
the  Actions required to be set forth on Section 5.14.1 of the 
Disclosure   32   Schedule, if adversely determined, will result in a
Material  Adverse Effect.   5.14.3. No order has been made, petition
presented or resolution  passed for the winding-up of either Company or any 
Subsidiary thereof and no meeting has been convened for the  purposes of
winding-up either Company or any Subsidiary  thereof. No steps have been
taken by either Company or any  Subsidiary thereof or by any other Person for
the  appointment of an administrator or receiver of all or any  part of any
of such Company\'s or such Subsidiary\'s assets.  Neither Company nor any

party to any  Contract regarding collective bargaining or other Contract 
with any labor or trade union or collective bargaining group  representing
any employee of such Company or such  Subsidiary, nor does any labor or trade
union or collective  bargaining agent represent any employee of such Company
or  such Subsidiary. No Contract regarding collective bargaining  has been
requested by, or is under discussion between  management of either Company or
Subsidiary thereof (or any  association of which either Company is a member
or otherwise  a participant) and any group of employees of such Company or 
such Subsidiary, nor are there any representation  proceedings or petitions
seeking a representation proceeding  presently pending against either Company
or Subsidiary  thereof, nor are there any other current activities to

Subsidiary thereof  that is currently the employer of such employee or on
whose  board such person acts as a director nor Buyer will by  reason of the
Transaction or anything done prior to the date  hereof be liable to any of
such employees or   33   directors for severance or any other payments
(other than  accrued salary or amounts required to be paid under  applicable

or independent contractors of such Company or such  Subsidiary. Except for
the provisions of the Employment  Contract of the President of the Companies,
none of the  execution, delivery or performance of any Transaction  Document

the  public domain, (b) Shareholder is required to disclose  pursuant to Law
or regulation, (c) is independently  developed by Shareholder, without
violating the terms of  this Agreement or any other Contract between
Shareholder and  either Company, Buyer or Parent or (d) is lawfully

obligation of confidentiality.   7.3.2. Shareholder agrees to limit its
internal disclosure of  Confidential Information only to those of its
employees or  consultants who need to know such information and who have 
signed a written agreement binding them to terms and  conditions
substantially similar to those set forth in this  Section 7.3 or who are
otherwise bound by confidentiality  obligations.   7.3.3. In the event that
Shareholder or any of its Affiliates or  its or their respective directors,
officers, employees or  other representatives are required by Law to disclose
any of  the Confidential Information, Shareholder will promptly  notify
Buyer in writing so that Buyer may seek a protective  order and/or other
motion to prevent or limit the production  or disclosure of such Confidential
Information. If such  motion has been denied, has not been promptly
prosecuted or  is pending and unresolved at the time disclosure of such 
Confidential Information is required by Law, then the Person  required to
disclose such Confidential Information may  disclose only such portion of
such Confidential Information  which (i) based on advice of Shareholder\'s
legal counsel is  required to be disclosed (provided that the Person
required  to disclose such Confidential Information will use all  reasonable
efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the  remainder of such
Confidential Information) or (ii) Buyer  consents in writing to having
disclosed. Shareholder will  not, and will not permit   41   any of its
Affiliates or its or their respective directors,  officers, employees and
other representatives to, oppose any  motion for confidentiality brought by
Buyer or any Company.  Shareholder will continue to be bound by its
obligations  pursuant to this Section 7.3 for any Confidential  Information
that is not required to be disclosed, or that  has been afforded protective
treatment, pursuant to such  motion. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Shareholder shall be  entitled to disclose Confidential Information to its 
regulators if required by Law or regulation without prior  notice, but shall
notify the agency to which the  Confidential Information was disclosed of the
confidential  nature thereof and notify Buyer as soon as practicable 
following the disclosure or, if possible and not in  violation of any Law,
prior to the disclosure.   7.4. Public Announcements.   No press release
or announcement concerning the Transaction will be  issued by Shareholder
without the prior consent of Parent or by  Parent without the prior consent
of Shareholder, except as such  release or announcement may be required by
Law, in which case the  Person required to make the release or announcement
will allow the  Person whose consent would otherwise be required reasonable
time to  comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance.  For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not be in
limitation  of the parties\' obligations hereunder to take such actions as 
required for the consummation of the Transaction.   7.5. Income Taxes and
Section 338(h)(10) Election.   7.5.1. With respect to the Companies and any
domestic Subsidiary of  the Companies, Shareholder shall, or shall cause
its  relevant Affiliates to, join with Buyer or Parent, as  applicable, in
filing a timely election under Section  338(h)(10) of the Code in accordance
with Treasury  Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or any successor provision 
("SECTION 338(H)(10) ELECTION"). Shareholder and Buyer or  Parent, as
applicable, shall also file, or cause the filing  of, timely elections under
any comparable provisions of  state or local Tax Laws. Buyer, Parent and
Shareholder will  take any and all actions necessary, including providing
all  required information on a timely basis, to cause such  elections to
become effective. Buyer shall prepare all  applicable forms for such
elections for review by  Shareholder at least 30 days before the date such
forms are  due to be filed, and Buyer and Shareholder shall negotiate  in
good faith to agree on such forms. Buyer or the Companies  may in their
discretion make elections under Section 338(g)  of the Code and any
comparable provisions of state or local  Tax Laws ("SECTION 338(G)
ELECTIONS") with respect to any  foreign Subsidiaries. Shareholder shall, at
Buyer\'s expense  to the extent of third party costs, provide all
information  and records that are reasonably necessary for Buyer to 
determine the costs and benefits to it of making the Section  338(g)
Elections. Buyer, Parent and Shareholder will report  the sale and
acquisition, respectively, of the Shares  pursuant to this Agreement
consistent with the Section  338(h)(10) Election (and any   42  
comparable elections under state or local Tax Laws) and, if  applicable, the
Section 338(g) Elections and will take no  position contrary thereto in any
Tax Return or in any  proceeding before any Governmental Authority or
otherwise.   7.5.2. For any Straddle Period of the Companies and their 
Subsidiaries, Buyer shall timely prepare and file all Tax  Returns required
to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due;  provided that Shareholder shall
reimburse Buyer for any  amount owed by Shareholder pursuant to Section 8.5
(Tax  Indemnity) with respect to the taxable periods covered by  such Tax
Returns. For any taxable period of the Companies  and their Subsidiaries that
ends on or before the date  hereof, Shareholder shall, consistent with past
practice,  timely prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be filed  and
shall pay all Taxes due; provided, however, that any  such Tax Return shall
be filed consistent with the Section  338(h)(10) Election and any Section
338(g) Elections.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
Shareholder shall include the income and other tax items of  the Companies
and their Subsidiaries on Shareholder\'s  consolidated federal Income Tax
Returns (and consolidated or  combined state Income Tax Returns) for all
periods through  the end of the date hereof and pay any federal Income
Taxes  (and consolidated or combined state Income Taxes)  attributable to
such income. The Companies and their  Subsidiaries shall furnish Tax
information available to them  to Shareholder for inclusion in the Tax
Returns required to  be filed by Shareholder pursuant to this Section 7.5.2
in  accordance with the Companies\' past custom and practice. For  purposes
of the Tax Returns described in this Section 7.5.2,  the income of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries shall be  apportioned to the period up to
and including the date  hereof and the period after the date hereof as
provided in  Section 8.5.3.2.   7.5.3. Shareholder, Buyer and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate,  and shall cause their Affiliates to cooperate, in
preparing  and filing all Tax Returns and claims for refunds and in 
resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all  taxable periods
relating to Taxes, including by maintaining  and making available to each
other all records necessary in  connection with Taxes. At Shareholder\'s
request, Buyer shall  cause any of the Companies and their Subsidiaries to
make or  join with Shareholder in making any other election if the  making
of such election does not have any adverse effect on  Buyer or its Affiliates
(including any of the Companies and  their Subsidiaries), as determined by
Buyer in its sole  discretion.   7.5.4. All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, registration and  other similar Taxes and fees incurred in connection
with the  sale of the Shares or otherwise in connection with this  Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be  borne equally by
Shareholder and Buyer.   7.5.5. Any payments that are made under Section 2.4
(Post-Closing  Adjustments) or Section 8 (Indemnification) shall be treated 
for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,  unless a
determination   43   (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code)
causes  any such payments to be otherwise treated for U.S. federal  Income
Tax purposes. The allocation of the Purchase Price  and liabilities pursuant
to Section 2.2.2 (Allocation of  Purchase Price) shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect  the items to which such payments relate.   7.5.6. Any
Tax sharing agreement between Shareholder and any of the  Companies and their
Subsidiaries is terminated as of the  date hereof and shall have no further
effect for any taxable  year (whether the current year, a future year, or a
past  year).   7.5.7. All refunds of Taxes relating to the Companies
received by  Shareholder, the Companies, Buyer or any of their Affiliates 
with respect to Tax periods ending on or before the date of  this Agreement
or relating to Shareholder\'s consolidated  federal Income Tax Returns, and
in each case for which  Shareholder is responsible under Section 8.5, will be
for  the account of Shareholder. Any such refunds shall be paid  to
Shareholder within thirty (30) days of receipt of such  refund by the
Companies, Buyer or any of their Affiliates.  Any refunds for any Straddle
Period shall be apportioned  between Shareholder and Buyer in the same manner
as provided  in Section 8.5.3.   7.5.8. Shareholder, each Company, Buyer or
any of their respective  Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns consistent
with the  allocation determined in Section 2.2.2 and shall not take  any Tax
position inconsistent with such allocation.   7.6. Release of Officers and
Directors.   Buyer and Parent shall release, on behalf of themselves and
each of  the Companies, each of the individual directors and officers of 
Shareholder and its Subsidiaries from any and all claims by Buyer,  Parent or
any of their Subsidiaries with respect to any action taken  or the failure to
take any action prior to the date of this  Agreement, by or in their capacity
as officers or directors of  Shareholder or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the  foregoing, this Section 7.6 shall not limit any rights
that Buyer or  any Affiliate of Buyer has against Shareholder pursuant to the
terms  of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.   7.7. Further
Assurances.   7.7.1. From time to time after the date hereof, at Buyer\'s 
reasonable request and without further consideration from  Buyer or Parent,
Shareholder shall execute and deliver such  other instruments of conveyance
and transfer and take such  other action as Buyer reasonably may require to
convey,  transfer to and vest in Buyer and to put Buyer in possession  of
the Shares in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, from time to time  following the date hereof, Shareholder
shall, and shall  cause its Affiliates to, at Shareholder\'s cost, execute, 
acknowledge and deliver to the Companies, in a reasonably  prompt manner, all
such properties, rights, titles,  interests, remedies, powers and   44  
privileges, and shall take all further actions that may be  commercially
reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure  the transfer to the Companies
of all of such properties,  rights, titles, interests, remedies, powers and
privileges  that are required for the Companies to continue conducting  the
Cable and Satellite Business after the date hereof in  the same manner as it
is conducted on the date hereof,  except in any case in which this Agreement
expressly  contemplates that Shareholder retain any such item.  Furthermore,
and without limiting the foregoing, to the  extent that any material assets,
property (tangible or  intangible), rights, instruments, Contracts or
privileges  form a part of the Cable and Satellite Business but are not 
transferred on the date hereof, Shareholder shall cause, as  soon as
practicable, such items to be conveyed, transferred  to and vested in Buyer
and to put Buyer in possession of  such items without any additional
consideration, except in  any case in which this Agreement expressly
contemplates that  Shareholder retain any such item.   7.7.2. From time to
time after the date hereof, Shareholder shall,  and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use its reasonable best  efforts (at its own expense) to
obtain, and to cooperate in  obtaining (including by designating employees to
work with  Buyer as reasonably necessary to give effect to this Section 
7.7.2) all consents or waivers from third parties in respect  of Contracts or
Permits necessary or appropriate to permit  Buyer to operate the Cable and
Satellite Business as  currently conducted, including Required Consents;
provided,  however, that the parties hereto shall not be required to  pay or
commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation  in favor of) any person
from whom any such consent may be  required (other than nominal filing or
application fees). If  any consent that is required (for any reason) under
a  Contract is not obtained prior to the date hereof,  Shareholder, Parent,
Buyer and the Companies shall cooperate  (at their own expense) in any lawful
and reasonable  arrangement reasonably proposed by Buyer under which Buyer 
shall obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits in  respect of such
Contract with respect to which the consent  has not been obtained and perform
the obligations relating  to such Contract in accordance with this Agreement.
Such  reasonable arrangement may include (i) in the case of a  Lease, the
subleasing to Buyer of any and all rights of  Shareholder against the other
party to such Lease arising  out of a breach or cancellation thereof by the
other party  and (ii) the enforcement by Shareholder of such rights.   7.8.
Employee Benefits.   Effective as of the date of this Agreement and for a
period of one  (1) year thereafter, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to
cause  each Company to provide to its employees benefits that are 
substantially the same as those provided by the Companies to such  employees
as of the date hereof (except where, in the reasonable  opinion of Buyer,
such benefits are not reasonably comparable to  generally accepted benefits
provided to employees of similar  position, seniority and experience engaged
in the same or in a  similar business as the Cable and   45   Satellite
Business); provided that Buyer shall not be required to  cause any Company to
offer to its employees benefits that are  superior to the existing benefits
of such employees. With respect to  all benefits provided to Company
employees following the date of  this Agreement, Buyer shall provide credit
to such employees for  prior service with the Company, the Shareholder or any
member of any  controlled group or affiliated service group (as defined in
Code  Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)) of which the Company is a member, 
for eligibility and vesting purposes only.   7.9. Disclaimer of
Warranties.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
the  express representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4 and 5 
hereof are the only representations and warranties concerning the  business
or any of the assets of either of the Companies,  Shareholder makes no
representation or warranty as to (i) the Open  Source Materials (but without
limiting the representations made in  Section 5.11.2) or (ii) the
functionality, acceptability, fitness  for any purpose or state of completion
of any Business Intellectual  Property, including the Collabrent Product. The
representations and  warranties set forth in Sections 4 and 5 hereof are made
expressly  in lieu of all other warranties and representations, express or 
implied.   7.10. Release of Companies Obligations.   The Shareholder, on
behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates,  releases the Companies and each
of their Subsidiaries from any and  all obligations, direct or indirect,
contingent or otherwise, owing  to the Shareholder or any of its Affiliates,
including payables,  other than the obligations contemplated by this
Agreement and the  Ancillary Documents.   7.11. Use of Name.   Within 60
days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause each of  the Companies to
change its corporate name to a name that does not  include "DST" or the name
of any of Shareholder\'s Subsidiaries  (other than "Innovis" or
"Interactive") and (b) neither Parent nor  any of its Affiliates (including
the Companies) shall have any right  to use the name of Shareholder or of any
of its Subsidiaries (other  than "Innovis" or "Interactive"), except that,
for a period ending  180 days after the Closing Date, Parent and its
Affiliates shall  have the right to use any catalogues, sales and
promotional  materials and printed forms that use such name and are included
in  the Business Intellectual Property as of the Closing Date or that  have
been ordered prior to the Closing Date for use in the Cable and  Satellite
Business; provided, however, that (i) promptly after the  Closing Date,
Parent shall make, or cause the Companies to make, all  filings with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities to effectuate  such name change, (ii)
each of Parent and the Companies shall use  its reasonable commercial efforts
to minimize the usage of the names  referred to in Section (a) hereof, and to
discontinue it as soon as  practicable after the Closing and (iii)
notwithstanding anything to  the contrary in this Section 7.11, to the extent
any approvals of  Governmental Authorities are necessary to   46  
effectuate the said name change, the time limits specified in this  Section
7.11 shall be extended by the time period necessary to  obtain such
approvals, so long as Parent and/or the Companies begins  the process of
seeking such approval within 60 days after the  Closing.  8.
INDEMNIFICATION.   8.1. Indemnity by Shareholder.   8.1.1. Subject to
Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, Shareholder agrees to  indemnify Buyer and Parent
and their Subsidiaries (including  the Companies) and their respective
employees, officers,  directors, controlling persons, successors and
assigns  (collectively, the "BUYER GROUP"), and hold the Buyer Group 
harmless from and with respect to any and all Damages  related to or arising
directly or indirectly from (i) any  inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by  Shareholder in this Agreement or (ii) any failure by 
Shareholder to perform any covenant, obligation or  undertaking made by
Shareholder in this Agreement.   8.1.2. Except for Damages incurred by any
member of the Buyer Group  arising from an inaccuracy in the representations
and  warranties set forth in Sections 4.1 (Organization and  Authority of
Shareholder), 4.2 (Non-contravention with  respect to Shareholder), 4.3
(Ownership of Shares), 5.1  (Organization of the Companies), 5.2 (Authority
of the  Companies), 5.3 (Non-contravention with respect to the  Companies)
or 5.9 (Tax Matters) or with respect to any  fraudulent statement made by
Shareholder or any Company in  this Agreement, no claim may be made by any
member of the  Buyer Group under Section 8.1.1 after the second anniversary 
of the date hereof (the "INDEMNIFICATION PERIOD"). The  representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 4.1  (Organization and Authority of
Shareholder), 4.2  (Non-contravention with respect to Shareholder), 4.3
(Title  to Shares), 5.1 (Organization of the Companies), 5.2  (Authority of
the Companies) 5.3 (Non-contravention with  respect to the Companies) or 5.9
(Tax Matters) will survive  the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and  shall
continue in full force and effect until ninety (90)  days after all
applicable statutes of limitation (including  any extensions thereof) have
expired and then expire with  respect to any theretofore unasserted claims
arising out of  or otherwise in respect of any breach of such 
representations and warranties; provided, however, that as  to each of the
foregoing, the obligations of Shareholder to  indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each member of the Buyer  Group shall not terminate with respect to
(i) any individual  item as to which any member of the Buyer Group shall
have,  before the expiration of the applicable period, made a bona  fide
claim in good faith by delivering a notice (stating in  reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) to Shareholder or  (ii) any act of fraud committed by
Shareholder in taking any  actions contemplated by this Agreement.   47  
8.1.3. Shareholder shall have no liability under Section 8.1.1 (a)  for any
individual claim for Damage incurred by any member  of the Buyer Group of
less than One Hundred Thousand dollars  ($100,000), (b) until the aggregate
of all claims for  Damages exceeds Five Million dollars ($5,000,000), and
then  only for the amount by which such Damages exceed Five  Million dollars
($5,000,000), and (c) for any Damages  incurred by any member of the Buyer
Group in excess, in the  aggregate for such member and the Buyer Group, of
Sixty  Million dollars ($60,000,000); provided, however, that the  foregoing
limitations shall not apply to claims in  connection with the failure to
comply with any of the  covenants and agreements of Shareholder set forth in
Section  2 or pursuant to any inaccuracy in the representations and 
warranties and covenants set forth in Sections 4.1  (Organization and
Authority of Shareholder), 4.2  (Non-contravention with respect to
Shareholder), 4.3 (Title  to Shares), 5.1 (Organization of the Companies),
5.2  (Authority of the Companies), 5.3 (Non-contravention with  respect to
the Companies), 5.7.4 (Absence of Indebtedness),  5.9 (Tax Matters), 7.5
(Income Taxes and Section 338(h)(10)  Election) or 7.7 (Further Assurances)
or any fraudulent  statement made by Shareholder in this Agreement; and 
provided further, however, that in no event shall  Shareholder be liable
under Section 8.1.1. for claims for  Damages made under any provision of this
Agreement for an  amount that shall exceed, in the aggregate, the total 
Purchase Price.   8.2. Indemnity by Buyer and Parent.   8.2.1. Subject to
Sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3, Buyer and Parent agree  to jointly and severally
indemnify Shareholder, its  Affiliates and their respective employees,
officers,  directors, controlling persons, successors and assigns 
(collectively, the "SHAREHOLDER GROUP"), and hold  Shareholder Group harmless
from and with respect to any and  all Damages related to or arising directly
or indirectly  from (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty 
made by Buyer or Parent in this Agreement, or (ii) any  failure by Buyer or
Parent to perform any covenant,  obligation or undertaking made by them in
this Agreement.   8.2.2. Except for Damages incurred by any member of the
Shareholder  Group arising from any fraudulent statement made by Buyer or 
Parent in this Agreement, no claim may be made by any member  of the
Shareholder Group under Section 8.2.1 after the  expiration of the
Indemnification Period; provided, however,  that the obligation of Buyer and
Parent to indemnify, defend  and hold harmless each member of the Shareholder
Group shall  not terminate with respect to (i) any individual item as to 
which any member of the Shareholder Group shall have, before  the expiration
of the applicable period, made a bona fide  claim in good faith by delivering
a notice (stating in  reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to Buyer
or  Parent or (ii) any act of fraud committed by Buyer or Parent  in taking
any actions contemplated by this Agreement.   48   8.2.3. Buyer and Parent
shall have no liability under Section 8.2.1  (a) for any individual claim for
Damage incurred by any  member of Shareholder Group of less than One
Hundred  Thousand dollars ($100,000), (b) until the aggregate of all  such
claims for Damages exceeds Five Million dollars  ($5,000,000), and (c) then
only for the amount by which such  Damages exceed Five Million dollars
($5,000,000) and (d) for  any Damages incurred by any member of Shareholder

that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to  claims in connection with
the failure to comply with any of  the covenants and agreements of Buyer or
Parent set forth in  Section 2.   8.3. Procedures for Indemnification.  
8.3.1. If a claim or demand is made against an Indemnitee, or an  Indemnitee
shall otherwise learn of an assertion, by any  Person who is not a party to
this Agreement (and who is not  an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement) (a
"THIRD PARTY  CLAIM") as to which a party (the "INDEMNIFYING Party") may  be
obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this  Agreement, such
Indemnitee will notify the Indemnifying  Party in writing, and in reasonable
detail, of the Third  Party Claim reasonably promptly after becoming aware of
such  Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give  any such
notification will not affect the indemnification  provided hereunder except
to the extent the Indemnifying  Party shall have demonstrated that it has
been actually  prejudiced as a result of such failure and to such extent.  
8.3.2. If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee and the 
Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee  therefor, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to assume  the defense thereof (at the
expense of the Indemnifying  Party) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party and  reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. Should the 
Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third  Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to  the Indemnitee for any legal or
other expenses subsequently  incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with
the defense  thereof as long as the Indemnifying Party diligently  conducts
such defense; provided that, if (i) in any  Indemnitee\'s reasonable judgment
a conflict of interest  exists in respect of such claim or (ii) any
Indemnifying  Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the  Indemnitee
(upon request of the Indemnitee) of such  Indemnifying Party\'s financial
capacity to defend such Third  Party Claim and provide indemnification with
respect  thereto, such Indemnitee will have the right to employ  separate
counsel to represent such Indemnitee and in that  event the reasonable fees
and expenses of such separate  counsel will be paid by such Indemnifying
Party. If the  Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third 
Party Claim, each Indemnitee will have the right to  participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at  its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the  Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will be
liable  for the reasonable fees and expenses   49   of counsel employed
by the Indemnitee for any period during  which the Indemnifying Party has
failed to assume the  defense thereof or if it does not expressly elect to
assume  the defense thereof (including the agreement by each  Indemnifying
Party to indemnify the Indemnitee as  aforesaid). If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of  any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
will  promptly supply to the Indemnitee copies of all  correspondence and
documents relating to or in connection  with such Third Party Claim and keep
the Indemnitee fully  informed of all developments relating to or in
connection  with such Third Party Claim (including, without limitation, 
providing to the Indemnitee on request updates and summaries  as to the
status thereof). If the Indemnifying Party chooses  to defend a Third Party
Claim, all the Indemnitees will  reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in the  defense thereof if requested by the Indemnifying Party (such 
cooperation to be at the expense, including reasonable legal  fees and
expenses, of the Indemnifying Party).   8.3.3. No Indemnifying Party will
consent to any settlement,  compromise or discharge (including the consent to
entry of  any judgment) of any Third Party Claim without the  Indemnitee\'s
prior written consent, which will not be  unreasonably withheld; provided,
that if the Indemnifying  Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee for a
Third Party  Claim, the Indemnitee will agree to any settlement,  compromise
or discharge of such Third Party Claim which the  Indemnifying Party may
recommend that unconditionally and  irrevocably releases the Indemnitee
(pursuant to a release  which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee) 
completely from all Liability in connection with such Third  Party Claim;
provided, however, that the Indemnitee may  refuse to agree to any such
settlement, compromise or  discharge that provides for injunctive or other
non-monetary  relief affecting the Indemnitee. If an Indemnifying Party 
agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee for a Third Party Claim,  the Indemnitee
will not (unless required by law) admit any  liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or  discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying  Party\'s prior written consent (which consent will not be 
unreasonably withheld).   8.3.4. Any claim on account of Damages which does
not involve a  Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given 
by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party from whom such  indemnification
is sought. The failure by any Indemnitee so  to notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve the  Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have
to  such Indemnitee under this Agreement, except to the extent  that the
Indemnifying Party shall have demonstrated that it  has been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure and  to such extent. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify  the Indemnitee prior to the expiration of
a 45-calendar-day  period following its receipt of such notice that the 
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnitee  under this
Agreement, such claim specified by the Indemnitee  in such notice will be
conclusively deemed a liability of  the Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement and the  Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of Damages  
50   subject to such claim to the Indemnitee on demand or, in the  case of
any notice in which the amount of the Damages  subject to such claim (or any
portion thereof) is estimated,  on such later date when the amount of such
claim (or such  portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the 
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with  respect to such
Damages subject to such claim, as provided  above, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnitee will  proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such  dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations by the  90th day
after notice of such claim was given to the  Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party and the  Indemnitee will be free to pursue such remedies
as may be  available under this Agreement or applicable law.   8.3.5. The
procedures set forth in this Section 8.3 (Procedures for  Indemnification),
shall not govern any claim or demand made  under Section 8.1 (Indemnity by
Shareholder) for any  inaccuracy in the representations and warranties set
forth  in Section 5.9 (Tax Matters) or any claims made under  Section 8.5
(Tax Indemnity).   8.4. Certain Rights and Limitations.   8.4.1. No loss,
Liability, damage or deficiency shall constitute  Damages to any party to the
extent of any insurance proceeds  actually received by such party with
respect to such loss,  Liability, damage or deficiency (after deducting
reasonable  costs and expenses incurred in connection with recovery of  such
proceeds). Each party shall use its commercially  reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Damages with respect to  which such party might bring, or has
brought, a claim for  indemnification under this Section 8; provided that no
party  shall be obligated to incur any monetary cost in connection  with
such an effort to mitigate.   8.4.2. Subject to Section 8.1.3, the amount of
Damages for which  indemnification is provided under this Agreement will be
(i)  increased to take account of any Tax cost incurred (grossed  up for
such increase) by the Indemnitee arising from the  receipt of indemnity
payments hereunder and (ii) reduced to  take account of any Tax benefit
realized by the Indemnitee  arising from the incurrence or payment of any
such Damages.  In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, 
the Indemnitee will be deemed to be subject to the  applicable federal,
state, local and/or local country taxes  at the maximum statutory rate then
in effect. Nothing in  this section shall be construed to require the
Indemnitee to  make available its Tax Returns (or any other information 
relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the  Indemnifying Party
or any other Person.   8.4.3. The parties acknowledge and agree that, except
for claims  against Shareholder based on fraud on the part of  Shareholder
in connection with the Transaction and except  for claims against Buyer or
Parent based on fraud on the  part of Buyer or Parent, as the case may be, in
connection  with the Transaction, the sole and exclusive monetary remedy 
with respect   51   to claims for Damages which may be made hereunder
not  excluded from Section 8.1.3, shall be pursuant to the  indemnification
provisions set forth in Section 8.2, and in  any event subject to Section
8.1.3. Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary, the claims described in
Section 8.1.1,  which are based on fraud as described herein, shall not be 
subject to the limitation set forth in Section 8.1.3.  Subject to Section
8.1.3, anything contained in this  Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
no recovery under  this Agreement shall be available to any party hereto
for  its own consequential, incidental or indirect damages;  provided,
however, that nothing herein shall prevent any  party hereto from being
indemnified for all components of  awards against it in Third Party Claims,
including  consequential, incidental or indirect damages components of  such
claims.   8.4.4. Buyer, Companies and Shareholder acknowledge and agree
that  the indemnification provision in this Section 8 shall be the 
exclusive remedy of Buyer and Shareholder with respect to  Companies and
their Subsidiaries, and the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  
8.5. Tax Indemnity.   8.5.1. Shareholder shall indemnify the Buyer Group and
hold the  Buyer Group harmless from (i) all liability of the Companies  and
their Subsidiaries for Income Taxes for any taxable  period that ends on or
before the date hereof (a  "PRE-CLOSING TAX PERIOD"), (ii) all liability of
the  Companies and their Subsidiaries for Income Taxes for the  portion of a
Straddle Period ending on the date hereof  (excluding any additional Tax
liability of Shareholder  resulting from any transaction engaged in by a
Company or  its Subsidiary not in the ordinary course of business  occurring
on the date hereof after Buyer\'s purchase of the  Shares) and calculated
pursuant to Section 8.5.3, (iii) all  liability for Income Taxes (including
liability for Taxes  imposed pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
or  any comparable provision of foreign, state or local Tax  Laws) of
Shareholder or any other Person (other than a  Company or a Subsidiary) that
is or has ever been affiliated  with either a Company or any Subsidiary, (iv)
all liability  of Shareholder, its Affiliates, or the Companies and their 
Subsidiaries for Income Taxes arising on the sale of the  Shares, including
all liability for Income Taxes resulting  from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election (or any comparable  elections under state or local Tax Laws)
contemplated by  Section 7.5.1 of this Agreement, (v) all liability of the 
Companies and their Subsidiaries scheduled in Section 5.9.1  of the
Disclosure Schedule for Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax  Period and any portion
of a Straddle Period (calculated  pursuant to Section 8.5.3) ending on the
date hereof  (excluding any additional Tax liability of Shareholder 
resulting from any transaction engaged in by such Company or  its
Subsidiaries not in the ordinary course of business on  the date hereof after
Buyer\'s purchase of the Shares), and  (vi) all liability for reasonable
legal, accounting,  appraisal, consulting or similar fees and expenses for
any  item attributable to any item in clause (i), (ii), (iii),  (iv) (except
to the extent addressed by   52   Section 2.2.2) or (v) above (the sum of
(i), (ii), (iii),  (iv) (except to the extent addressed by Section 2.2.2),
(v)  and (vi) being referred to herein as "INDEMNIFIED  PRE-CLOSING TAXES").
For the avoidance of doubt, Indemnified  Pre-Closing Taxes shall not include
any expenses incurred by  Buyer in making the allocation referred to in
Section 2.2.2  or any fees paid to any third party in connection
therewith.   8.5.2. Buyer shall, and after the date hereof shall cause the 
Companies and their Subsidiaries to, indemnify Shareholder  and each of its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,  stockholders, agents and
representatives and hold them  harmless from all liability for Taxes
resulting from any  Section 338(g) Elections contemplated by Section 7.5.1
of  this Agreement and all Taxes of the Companies and their  Subsidiaries
(i) for any taxable period beginning after the  date hereof and (ii) for any
portion of a Straddle Period  beginning after (but not including) the date
hereof,  including any additional Tax liability of Shareholder  resulting
from any transaction engaged in by a Company or  its Subsidiary not in the
ordinary course of business  occurring on the date hereof after Buyer\'s
purchase of the  Shares ("INDEMNIFIED POST-CLOSING TAXES"), but excluding
any  Tax liability of Shareholder arising from the sale of the  Shares, or
the Section 338(h)(10) Election.   8.5.3. In the case of any taxable period
that includes (but does  not end on) the date hereof (a "STRADDLE
PERIOD"):   8.5.3.1. real, personal and intangible property Taxes 
("PROPERTY TAXES") of the Companies and their  Subsidiaries for the Straddle
Period (other than  Taxes imposed in connection with the sale of the 
Shares) shall be equal to the amount of such  Property Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period  multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which  is the
number of days during the Straddle Period  that are prior to the date hereof
and the  denominator of which is the number of days in the  Straddle Period;
and   8.5.3.2. the Taxes of the Companies and their Subsidiaries  (other
than Property Taxes) for the Straddle Tax  Period shall be computed as if
such taxable  period ended as of the close of business on the  date hereof
and, if the Companies and their  Subsidiaries own any equity interest in
any  partnership or other "flow through" entity, as if  a taxable period of
such partnership or other  "flow through" entity ended as of the close of 
business on the date hereof.   8.5.4. Shareholder shall pay the amount of
any Indemnified  Pre-Closing Taxes to Buyer, and Buyer shall pay the amount 
of any Indemnified Post-Closing Taxes to Shareholder, five  (5) days prior to
the date on which the Tax Return with  respect to the liability for such
Taxes is required to be  filed or such Taxes are required to be paid;
provided that  notice has been given   53   pursuant to Section 8.5.5 at
least thirty (30) days prior to  such required filing or payment date (for
the avoidance of  doubt, failure to give such notice at least thirty days
(30)  prior to such required filing or payment date shall not  constitute a
waiver of the indemnification obligation). The  payments to be made pursuant
to this paragraph shall be  appropriately adjusted to reflect any
determination (within  the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code) with
respect to  Taxes.   8.5.5. If a claim shall be made by any Governmental
Authority,  that, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to 
Buyer, Shareholder, one of their respective Affiliates or  any of their
respective officers, directors, employees,  stockholders, agents or
representatives pursuant to Section  8, or a party otherwise wishes to
otherwise assert a claim  against the other party for Indemnified Pre-Closing
or  Indemnified Post-Closing Taxes, then the party seeking  indemnification
for such claim shall give notice of such  claim (and any proposed
counterclaim) within thirty (30)  days of becoming aware of such claim to the
Indemnifying  Party in writing (a "TAX CLAIM"). Such notice shall include 
supporting schedules and documentation reasonably sufficient  to establish
such claim. Failure to provide such notice  shall result in a waiver of the
indemnification obligation  with respect to such Tax Claim to the extent
the  indemnifying party has been actually prejudiced as a result  of such
failure. For the purposes of this Section 8.5.5, a  claim gives rise to the
notice requirement when asserted in  writing by a Governmental Authority or
one of its  representatives.   8.5.6. With respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a taxable period  ending on or prior to the date hereof and for
which  Shareholder is obligated to indemnify Buyer, Shareholder  shall
control all proceedings and may make all decisions  taken in connection with
such Tax Claim (including selection  of counsel) and, without limiting the
foregoing, may in its  sole discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative  appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any 
Governmental Authority with respect thereto; provided,  however, that
Shareholder must first consult in good faith  with Buyer before taking any
such action. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, with respect to any portion of
such Tax Claim  that could have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer, (i) 
Shareholder shall not settle that portion of such Tax Claim  without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent  shall not be unreasonably
withheld, (ii) Buyer, and counsel  of its own choosing, at Buyer\'s expense,
shall have the  right to participate fully in all aspects of the defense of 
that portion of such Tax Claim, (iii) Shareholder shall  inform Buyer,
reasonably promptly in advance, of the date,  time and place of all
proceedings relating to that portion  of such Tax Claim, (iv) Buyer shall be
entitled to have its  representatives attend and participate in any such 
proceedings, and (v) Shareholder shall provide to Buyer all  information,
correspondence and other documents relating to  that portion of such Tax
Claim promptly upon receipt from,  or in advance of submission to (as the
case may be), the  relevant Governmental Authority.   54   Buyer shall
not settle any Tax Claim referred to in this  Section 8.5.6 without the prior
written consent of Seller,  which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   8.5.7. Shareholder and Buyer shall jointly control and
participate  in all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim 
relating to Taxes of a Company or Subsidiary for a Straddle  Period. Neither
Shareholder nor Buyer shall settle any such  Tax Claim without the prior
written consent of the other.  With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a
taxable period  beginning after the date hereof, the Buyer shall control
all  proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection  with such
Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and,  without limiting the
foregoing, may in its sole discretion  pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals,  proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
Governmental  Authority with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, with respect to any portion of such Tax Claim  that could have a
Material Adverse Effect on Shareholder,  including as a result of an
indemnification claim hereunder,  (i) Buyer shall not settle that portion of
such Tax Claim  without the prior written consent of Shareholder, which 
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii)  Shareholder, and counsel of
its own choosing, at  Shareholder\'s expense, shall have the right to
participate  fully in all aspects of the defense of that portion of such 
Tax Claim, (iii) Buyer shall inform Shareholder, reasonably  promptly in
advance, of the date, time and place of all  proceedings relating to that
portion of such Tax Claim, (iv)  Shareholder shall be entitled to have its
representatives  attend and participate in any such proceedings, and (v)
the  Buyer shall provide to Shareholder all information,  correspondence and
other documents relating to that portion  of such Tax Claim promptly upon
receipt from, or in advance  of submission to (as the case may be), the
relevant  Governmental Authority.   8.5.8. Buyer, the Companies and each of
their respective Affiliates  on the one hand, and Shareholder and its
Affiliates on the  other hand, shall reasonably cooperate in contesting any
Tax  Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and,  upon
request, the provision to the requesting person of  records and information
which are reasonably relevant to  such Tax Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually  convenient basis to provide additional information
or  explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify  at
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.   8.5.9. Neither Shareholder nor
Buyer shall be obligated to  indemnify under this Section 8.5 to the extent
that  Shareholder or Buyer, as applicable, has made an  indemnification
payment to Buyer or Shareholder, as  applicable, for the same Taxes pursuant
to Section 8.1.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 
8.5, Shareholder shall not be obligated to make any  indemnity payments under
this Section 8.5 for any payroll  withholding Taxes of the Companies.  
55   8.5.10. All indemnification payments under this Section 8.5 shall be 
adjusted as provided in Sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.2.   8.5.11. Unless expressly
modified by this Section 8.5 or otherwise  expressly rendered inapplicable to
Tax Claims, all other  provisions of Section 8 shall apply to Tax
Claims.  9. GENERAL PROVISIONS   9.1. Assignment.   No party to this
Agreement will convey, assign or otherwise transfer  any of its rights or
obligations under the Agreement without the  prior written consent of
Shareholder (in the case of an assignment  by Buyer or Parent) or of Buyer
(in the case of an assignment by  Shareholder), except that Buyer may
(without obtaining any consent)  assign any of its rights, interests or
obligations under this  Agreement, in whole or in part, to any direct or
indirect Affiliate  of Buyer or Parent or to any successor to all or any
portion of its  business. Any conveyance, assignment or transfer requiring
prior  written consent that is made without such consent will be void ab 
initio. No assignment of this Agreement will relieve the assigning  party of
its obligations hereunder.   9.2. Parties in Interest.   This Agreement is
binding upon and is for the benefit of the parties  hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. This  Agreement is not made for
the benefit of any Person not a party  hereto, and no Person other than the
parties hereto or their  respective successors and permitted assigns will
acquire or have any  benefit, right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this  Agreement, except that members of the Buyer Group and Shareholder 
Group will be entitled to the rights to indemnification provided to  the
Buyer Group and Shareholder Group, respectively, hereunder.   9.3.
Amendment.   This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented
except  by a written agreement executed by Buyer, Parent and Shareholder.  
9.4. Waiver; Remedies.   No failure or delay on the part of Buyer, Parent or
Shareholder in  exercising any right, power or privilege under the Agreement
will  operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any waiver on the part of 
Buyer, Parent or Shareholder of any right, power or privilege under  the
Agreement operate as a waiver of any other right, power or  privilege under
this Agreement, nor will any single or partial  exercise of any right, power
or privilege thereunder preclude any  other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other  right, power or privilege under this Agreement.
The rights and  remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any  rights or remedies that the parties may otherwise have at law or in 
equity.   56   9.5. Fees and Expenses.   Each of Shareholder and Buyer
will pay, without right of  reimbursement from the other, all of their
respective costs and  expenses incident to the performance of their
respective obligations  hereunder, including the fees and disbursements of
counsel,  accountants, experts and consultants employed by the respective 
parties in connection with the Transaction.   9.6. Notices.   All notices,
requests, claims, demands and other communications  required or permitted to

Unless  otherwise specified, all references contained in any Transaction 
Document, in any exhibit or schedule referred to therein or in any 
instrument or document delivered pursuant thereto to dollars or "$"  shall
mean United States dollars.   9.8. Entire Document.   This Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents collectively  constitute the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to  the subject matter hereof and this
Agreement and the other  Transaction Documents supersede all prior
negotiations, agreements  and understandings of the parties of any nature,
whether oral or  written, relating thereto.   58   9.9. Severability.  
If any provision of any Transaction Document or the application  thereof to
any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of  competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the  remaining provisions
thereof, or the application of such provision  to Persons or circumstances
other than those as to which it has been  held invalid or unenforceable,
shall remain in full force and effect  and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated thereby.   9.10. Governing Law.   This Agreement
will be governed by and construed in accordance with  the internal laws of
the State of Delaware applicable to contracts  made and to be performed
entirely within such State, without regard  to the conflicts of law
principles of such State.   9.11. Jurisdiction, Service of Process.   Each
of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive  jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the District of  Delaware, or if such
court does not have jurisdiction, the Court of  Chancery of the State of
Delaware, for the purposes of any suit,  action or other proceeding arising
out of this Agreement. Each of  the parties hereto further agrees that
service of any process,  summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to such party\'s  respective address set forth in Section 9.6 shall be
effective  service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in
Delaware  with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to 
jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding  sentence. Each
of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally  waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any action, suit or  proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby in (a) the United States
District Court for the  District of Delaware or (b) the Court of Chancery of
the State of  Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives  and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such 
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been  brought in an
inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  this Section 9.11 shall
not apply to any dispute under Section 2.2  or Section 2.4 that is required
to be decided by the Dispute  Accountants.   9.12. Schedules and Exhibits;
Disclosure.   All schedules and exhibits attached hereto are hereby
incorporated  in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein.  Capitalized terms used in any other Transaction Document or in the 
schedules or exhibits hereto or thereto but not otherwise defined  therein
will have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in  this
Agreement.   9.13. Counterparts.   This Agreement may be executed in
separate counterparts, each such  counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such  counterparts will together constitute the same
agreement.   59   9.14. Specific Performance.   In the event of any
actual or threatened default in, or breach of,  any of the terms, conditions
and provisions of any Transaction  Document, the party or parties who are or
are to be thereby  aggrieved will have the right of specific performance and
injunctive  relief giving effect to its or their rights under such
Transaction  Document, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies
at  law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies will be  cumulative.
The parties agree that any such breach or threatened  breach would cause
irreparable injury, that the remedies at law for  any such breach or
threatened breach, including monetary damages,  are inadequate compensation
for any loss and that any defense in any  action for specific performance
that a remedy at law would be  adequate is waived.   9.15. Construction;
Interpretation.   The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and  drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of 
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed  as if
drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of  proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the  authorship of any
of the provisions of this Agreement.   9.16. Withholding Obligations.  
The payment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2 will be in 
compliance with all applicable Tax withholding obligations, and,  without
derogating from the generality of the foregoing, subject to  the provisions
of this Agreement, Buyer will be entitled to either  seek exemption from any
Tax withholding obligations or withhold Tax  as required under applicable
law.   [REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]      60   IN
