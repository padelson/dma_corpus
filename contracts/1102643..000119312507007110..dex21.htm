conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article IX_ (other than those that by
their terms cannot be satisfied prior to the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver (in writing) of such conditions at the Closing);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions, the parties shall not be required to effect the Closing until
the earliest of ( _a_ ) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent
on no less than three Business Days notice to the Company, ( _b_ ) the final
day of the Marketing Period and ( _c_ ) the Outside Date, subject, in each
case, to the satisfaction or waiver (in writing) of all the conditions set

Section 3.1 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in

_Certificate of Incorporation_ ") until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by Applicable Law.

Section 3.2  _By-Laws_. The By-Laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_By-Laws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or by Applicable
Law. 

Section 3.3 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, ( _a_
) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, as set
forth on a schedule delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the Effective

ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON STOCK;

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 4.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than ( _i_ ) Common Shares (
_A_ ) held in treasury by the Company, or ( _B_ ) held by any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ "), ( _ii_ ) Appraisal Shares,
( _iii_ ) Restricted Shares and ( _iv_ ) Rollover Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive, in accordance with this _Article IV_, $17.00 in
cash (the per share cash consideration to be issued to the holders of such
Common Shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). No interest shall accrue or be
paid on the Merger Consideration.

(b) _Cancellation of Common Shares_.

(i) At the Effective Time, each Common Share converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such Common Shares (each,  



 

12  a " _Certificate_ ") (other than Certificates representing Excluded Shares,
Appraisal Shares, Restricted Shares and Rollover Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with this _Article IV_.

(ii) Each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be canceled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one newly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates for Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Paying Agent and Procedures_.

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, separate and
apart from its other funds, as a trust fund for the holders of record of
Certificates (each a " _Holder_ "), cash in the amount equal to the aggregate
Merger Consideration which such Holders are entitled to receive pursuant to
this _Article IV_ plus cash to pay for Options and Restricted Shares pursuant
to _Section 4.3(a)_ and _Section 4.3(c)_ , respectively (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_ ").

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make
available for collection by hand) to each Holder ( _A_ ) a letter of
transmittal (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company), which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall be in such form and have such other customary
provisions as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify and
( _B_ ) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration to be received by such Holder pursuant
to _Section 4.1(a)_.

(iii) Each Holder of a Certificate representing any Common Shares that have
been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration set forth in 
_Section 4.1(a)_ shall, upon surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to
the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Common Share
formerly represented by such Certificate, in the form of a check, to be mailed
(or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering
Holder of a Certificate) as promptly as practicable after  



 

13  receipt thereof and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be marked
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices.

(iv) In the event of the surrender of a Certificate that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company under the name of the Person surrendering
such Certificate, the Merger Consideration shall be paid to such a transferee
if such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent and such Certificate is
duly endorsed or is accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
or any other Taxes required by reason of such payments being made in a name
other than the name of the Person surrendering such Certificate have been
paid. If any Merger Consideration is to be delivered to a Person whose name
is other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the Person
requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required to be
paid by reason of such delivery to a Person whose name is other than that of
the Holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(b) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be marked canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article IV_.

(c) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund (including
any interest and other income resulting from any investment of the Merger
Fund) that remains unclaimed by the Holders and other eligible Persons in
accordance with this _Article IV_ following six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any Holder who has not previously complied with this _Article IV_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration.

(d)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue the Merger
Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.
Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of such bond shall be deemed
delivery of a Certificate with respect to the relevant Common Shares for
purposes of this _Article IV_.



 

14 (e) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or other amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Common
Shares (including Restricted Shares) or Options such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision
of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holder of the Common Shares (including
Restricted Shares) or Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the Merger Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Investment of Merger Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Merger Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
_provided_ that in the case of any Losses incurred as a result of such
investments, Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Merger Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parents
obligations under this _Article IV_. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

Section 4.3 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Shares_.

(a) _Options_.

(i) Except as provided in _Section 4.3(a)(ii)_ and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any holder of any Common Shares or Options, each Option (whether vested or
unvested) shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the excess (if any) of ( _A_ ) of the
product of ( _x_ ) the number of Common Shares subject to such Option
(assuming full vesting of such Option) and ( _y_ ) the Merger Consideration
_over_ ( _B_ ) the aggregate exercise price of such Option.

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section 4.3(a)(i)_, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, Parent may permit holders of certain Options to exchange some
or all of their outstanding Options for options to purchase shares of common
stock (or other class of equity) of Parent on such terms as are reasonably
acceptable to Parent (each, a " _Rollover Option_ "). Parent intends that
such exchange will be made in compliance with procedures for substitution of
options by reason of a corporate transaction pursuant to the regulations and
guidance under Code Section 409A. Parent and Company will cooperate to take
such actions as they reasonably agree are necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 4.3(a)(ii)_.



 

15 (b) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As of the date hereof, the Company shall
take all actions necessary so that the Offering (as that term is defined in
the U.S.I. Holdings Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "))
which ends on March 31, 2007 is the last Offering under the ESPP. No further
elections to purchase Common Shares may be made after the date hereof under
the ESPP and the maximum number of Common Shares that may be purchased under
the ESPP will not exceed 30,000.

(c) _Restricted Shares_. Except as provided in _Section 4.3(d)_ and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any Restricted Shares, all Restricted
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest
and become free of all restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time
and shall be canceled, retired and shall cease to exist and shall be converted
into the right to receive, in respect of each underlying Common Share, the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 4.2(a)_.

(d) _Rollover Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 4.3(c)_, between the date
hereof and the Effective Time, Parent may permit ( _i_ ) holders of certain
Restricted Shares, and ( _ii_ ) employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary who hold Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to exchange some or all of their Restricted
Shares or Common Shares, as applicable, for shares of common stock (or other
class of equity) of Parent on such terms as are reasonably acceptable to
Parent (each, a " _Rollover Share_ "). Parent and Company will cooperate to
take such actions as they reasonably agree are necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 4.3(d)_.

(e) _Paying Agent_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide the Paying Agent with a list of all holders of Options and Restricted
Shares certified by an officer of the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Corporations transfer agent. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of Options
or Restricted Shares a letter of transmittal (in a form approved by the
Company) and instructions for use in obtaining the value of such Options or
Restricted Shares as contemplated by _Section 4.3(a)_ and _Section 4.3(c)_ ,
respectively. All payments with respect to canceled Options and Restricted
Shares shall be made by the Paying Agent (and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to make such payments) as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time from funds deposited by or at the direction of Parent (in order to pay
such amounts) in accordance with _Section 4.2(a)_.

Section 4.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Subject to _Section 9.3(d)_, Common Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by any Person who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal
of such Common Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (such  



 

16  Section, " _Section 262_ ," and such shares, " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 4.1(a)_ , but rather, the holders of Appraisal Shares
shall be entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares
in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ that if any such holder shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(without interest thereon) as provided in _Section 4.1(a)_. The Company shall
notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of any Common Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 4.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that,
notwithstanding _Section 7.1(e)_ , the Company changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding
prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Common Shares,
at any time during the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time
(excluding any issuances of Common Shares permitted pursuant to the terms of
this  _Article IV_ ), then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted, taking into account the record and payment or effective dates, as
the case may be, for such transaction.

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in ( _i_ ) a disclosure letter (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") delivered to Parent by the Company prior to the execution of this
Agreement, which Company Disclosure Letter identifies the sections to which it
relates (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any section of the
Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be disclosed in any other section
of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent it is readily apparent from
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other section), or
( _ii_ ) the Company Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date
of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth in any risk factor
section, in any section relating to forward-looking statements and any other
disclosures therein to the extent they are cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature and excluding (only with respect to the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 5.7_ and _Section 5.9_) information in the
Company Reports concerning matters relating, directly or indirectly, to
Contingent Commissions) shall if, any only if, the nature and content of the
applicable disclosure in such Company Reports is sufficiently specific that

the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 5.1 _Corporate Status_. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware

its properties and to carry on its business as is now being conducted. The
Company is duly qualified or licensed to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as is now being conducted in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available
to Parent or Merger Sub complete and correct copies of its Constituent
Documents as amended and in effect on the date hereof. The Company is not in
material violation of any provision of its Constituent Documents.

Section 5.2 _Company Subsidiaries_.

(a) Section 5.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth: ( _i_ ) the
name of each Subsidiary owned (whether directly or indirectly) by the Company

of its organization; ( _ii_ ) the name of each Company Subsidiary that is
registered or licensed as ( _A_ ) a broker or dealer under the Exchange Act or

or of record).

that the Company is solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time and
assuming the accuracy and completeness of the representations and warranties

continue or otherwise participate in any discussions (other than with Parent,

prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (but not after), in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative
Transaction Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with this
_Section 8.4_, and after giving Parent written notice of such action, ( _x_ )
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such unsolicited bona fide written Alternative
Transaction Proposal pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms that are no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ that a copy of all
such information not previously provided to Parent (or its Representatives) is
provided as promptly as practicable to Parent, and ( _y_ ) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such unsolicited bona fide
written Alternative Transaction Proposal (and its advisors) regarding such
unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal, if and only to
the extent that, ( _1_ ) the Company has not breached this  _Section 8.4_, (
_2_ ) prior to taking any action described in clauses ( _x_ ) or ( _y_ )
above, the Company Board (and the Special  



 

47  Committee) determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that taking such action is necessary to comply with the
directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, and ( _3_ ) in each such
case referred to in clauses ( _x_ ) or ( _y_ ) above, the Company Board (and
the Special Committee) has determined in good faith and after consultation
with its financial advisor and legal counsel that either ( _i_ ) such
Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or ( _ii_ )
there is a reasonable likelihood that such Alternative Transaction Proposal
will result in a Superior Proposal.

(b) Neither the Company Board nor the Special Committee shall, directly or
indirectly, ( _i_ ) ( _A_ ) withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent) or publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or amend
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by such board of directors or any such committee
thereof of this Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or ( _B_ ) recommend, adopt or approve, or
propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Transaction
Proposal (any action described in this clause ( _i_ ) being referred to as an
" _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or ( _ii_ ) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding ( _A_ ) constituting
or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Transaction
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section
8.4(a)_ or ( _B_ ) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that the Company shall not be prohibited from entering into an agreement
referred to in and in accordance with this _Section 8.4(b)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 8.4(b)_, prior to the
time, but not after, that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if
the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Transaction
Proposal which the Company Board (and the Special Committee) concludes in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent
including pursuant to this _Section 8.4(b)_, the Company Board (and the
Special Committee) may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, ( _x_ ) make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or ( _y_ ) terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause ( _y_ ), and any purported termination pursuant to the
foregoing clause ( _y_ ) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in
advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Company
Termination Fee, as required by _Section 10.3_; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that neither the Company Board nor the Special Committee may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing
clause ( _x_ ) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (
_y_ ) unless ( _A_ ) the Company shall not have breached this _Section 8.4_
and ( _B_ ) the Company shall have  



 

48  provided prior written notice to Parent, at least five (5) Business Days in
advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the per share
value of the consideration offered therein and the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "); and ( _C_ ) prior to making such make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and
shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute
a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions (or revisions that
in the aggregate are material) are made to the initial Superior Proposal,
the Company shall deliver to Parent within one (1) Business Day written
notice of any such revisions (including a detailed description thereof) and a
new Notice Period shall be deemed to have commenced with respect to such
modified Superior Proposal on the date of delivery of such notice to Parent.
The Company shall keep Parent apprised as to the status of any material
developments, discussions and negotiations concerning any potential
Alternative Acquisition Agreement on a current basis (and in any event,
within one (1) Business Day) after the occurrence of any such development,
discussion or negotiation.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company or
the Company Board (including the Special Committee) shall be permitted to

determining which filings are required to be made prior to the Effective Time

Parent or Merger Sub to prepay (with proceeds of the Financing) all
obligations under, the Company Credit Agreement on the Closing Date, and
Parent and Merger Sub agree to pay all obligations under the Company Credit

with the foregoing, the Company, on the one hand, will provide Parent, and
Parent, on the other hand, will provide the Company, with copies of material
correspondence, filings or communications (or oral summaries or memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between such party or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
their respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and

Effective Time or otherwise that are material to Parent and the Company; or
(ii) agree to any other material limitation or restriction on the business of

property or assets (whether material or immaterial), or to agree to any
limitation or restriction on any of their respective businesses (whether
material or immaterial).

Section 8.6 _Public Announcements; Public Disclosures_. Parent and the
Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public statement or broad-based written statement to employees with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except

(a) Until December 31, 2007 (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "), and
subject to the last sentence of this _Section 8.7(a)_ , Parent shall provide,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to provide, for those employees of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries who continue as employees of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries during the Benefits
Continuation Period (the " _Company Employees_ "), base pay and employee
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate (excluding any equity or
equity equivalent award opportunities and other equity based compensation,
except as otherwise agreed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation) to those
currently provided by the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary to such
employees pursuant to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company
Benefit Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to provide, severance benefits to Company Employees which are no
less favorable than the severance benefits under the plan set forth in
Section 8.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting under
any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after
the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), the Company Employees
shall receive service credit for service with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (and any respective predecessors) to the same extent such service
credit was granted under the Company Benefit Plans, except to the extent any
such service credit is not recognized under the New Plans for other employees
or to the extent such service credit would result in the duplication of
benefits. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (
_i_ ) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time or satisfaction of any other eligibility
requirements, in any and all New Plans to the extent that ( _A_ ) coverage
under such New Plan replaces coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and ( _B_ ) such  



 

51  Company Employee has satisfied all waiting time and other eligibility
requirements under the Old Plan being replaced by the New Plan; and ( _ii_ )
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause ( _x_ ) all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents and (
_y_ ) any expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all
employment, severance and termination plans and agreements (including change
in control provisions) with employees or independent contractors of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 8.7_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 8.7_)
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 8.8 _Company Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the
Companys existing indemnification provisions as of the date hereof
with respect to present and former directors, officers, employees and agents
of the Company and all other Persons who may presently serve or have served at
the Companys request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for all expenses, judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement by reason of actions or omissions or
alleged actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to
the fullest extent permitted or required under, ( _i_ ) Applicable Law, ( _ii_
) the Companys Constituent Documents in effect on the date hereof (to the
extent consistent with Applicable Law) and ( _iii_ ) indemnification
agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in effect on the date
hereof (to the extent consistent with Applicable Law), for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations under such indemnification
provisions in accordance with their respective terms.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to purchase a single payment, run-off policy or policies
of  



 

52  directors and officers liability insurance covering the Persons currently
covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policies for claims arising in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (but only in respect thereof) in amount
and scope at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the Companys existing
policies, such policy or policies to become effective at the Effective Time
and remain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such run-off policy or policies
shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the aggregate annual amounts
currently paid by the Company to maintain its existing directors and officers
 liability insurance policies (which amount is disclosed in Section 8.8(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter); and _provided_ , _further_ , that, if such
run-off policy or policies cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by
paying aggregate premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall only be
required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying a premium
equal to two hundred percent (200%) of such amount.

(c) [Reserved].

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their successors or
assigns ( _i_ ) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or ( _ii_ ) shall transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other
entity, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
8.8_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 8.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives.

Section 8.9 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation
is or may become applicable to the Merger, the Company, the Company Board and
the Special Committee shall ( _a_ ) grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (
_b_ ) otherwise take all such actions as are necessary to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the Merger.

Section 8.10 [Reserved].

Section 8.11 _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause Merger Sub
to take, all actions and to do, or cause Merger Sub to do, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (provided
that Parent and Merger Sub  



 

53  may, after consultation with the Company, replace or amend the Debt
Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as the terms thereof
would not, in the reasonable good faith judgment of Parent, adversely impact
in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby), including reasonable best efforts to ( _a_
) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitments, subject to the foregoing
replacement and amendment rights, ( _b_ ) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing set
forth therein that are within their control (including by consummating the
Equity Financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments),
and ( _c_ ) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms
and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments or on other
terms acceptable to Parent that would not adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, at
the Closing Parent shall draw down on the Debt Financing if the conditions to
the Debt Financing Commitments are then satisfied. In the event any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Debt Financing Commitments and the Equity Commitment Letter,
as applicable, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on terms and conditions
that are not materially less beneficial to Parent and Merger Sub, including
with respect to conditionality, in the reasonable good faith judgment of
Parent (after consultation with the Company), promptly following the
occurrence of such event. In the event that the ownership of Parent is
offered or transferred or assigned in whole or in part (to the extent
permitted under the Equity Financing Commitment), Parent shall be responsible
for causing the Persons to whom such ownership is offered or transferred
or assigned and the representatives of such Persons to be bound by the
restrictions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and shall otherwise
have the right to provide information regarding the Company and this Agreement
in connection with such syndication.

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective officers, employees, representatives and advisors to
provide, all reasonable cooperation (including with respect to timeliness) in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, including ( _i_ ) participation in meetings,
presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, "road shows" and
sessions with rating agencies, ( _ii_ ) furnishing Parent and its financing
sources as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than thirty-
five (35) days prior to the Outside Date) with financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
including all financial statements, financial data and other information
(including with respect to the Companys fiscal year ended December 31, 2006)
( _A_ ) of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act and of type and form customarily included in private placements
under Rule 144A of the Securities Act to consummate the offering of senior
and senior subordinated notes contemplated by the Financing Commitments at the
time during the Companys fiscal year such offerings will be made and ( _B_ )
all financial statements and other information relating to the Company
necessary for the satisfaction  



 

54  of the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments (collectively, the
" _Required Information_ "), ( _iii_ ) assisting Parent and its financing
sources in the preparation of ( _A_ ) one or more offering documents and or
confidential information memoranda for any portion of the Debt Financing and (
_B_ ) materials for rating agency presentations, ( _iv_ ) reasonably
cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for
any portion of the Debt Financing, including providing assistance in
preparation for, and participating in, meetings, drafting sessions and due
diligence sessions, ( _v_ ) providing and executing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including customary certificates (including a
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency matters), legal opinions, consents of accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing and customary
representation letters in connection with bank confidential information
memoranda, ( _vi_ ) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral and

related documents and ( _viii_ ) using its reasonable best efforts to cause
its independent accountants to provide assistance to Parent, including
providing consent to Parent to prepare and use their audit reports relating to
the Company and to provide any necessary "comfort letters"; provided that the
Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee that
is not reimbursed by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall
mean the first period of thirty-five (35) consecutive days after the date
hereof throughout which ( _A_ ) Parent shall have the Required Information
that the Company is required to provide to Parent pursuant to this  _Section
8.11(b)_ which Required Information is and remains Compliant (as defined
below), and ( _B_ ) the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ shall be and
remain satisfied; provided that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier
date which is the third (3rd) Business Day following the date the Debt
Financing is consummated. " _Compliant_ " shall mean, with respect to any
Required Information, that such Required Information ( _i_ ) does not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
regarding the Company necessary in order to made such Required Information not
misleading, ( _ii_ ) is, and remains throughout the Marketing Period,
compliant in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and in a form
customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities
Act, in each case, assuming such Required Information is intended to be the
information to be used for an offering of securities by the Company in
connection with the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters and
( _iii_ ) Deloitte and Touche LLP has not withdrawn its audit opinion with
respect to any financial statements contained in any of the Companys filings
with the SEC or in the Required Information.

Section 8.12 _Additional Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including
using all reasonable best efforts to obtain all  



 

55  necessary waivers, consents and approvals in connection with the
Governmental Requirements and any other third party consents and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall take
all such necessary action. 

Section 8.13 _Section 16(b)_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 8.14 _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, except as otherwise
may be agreed by Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of all directors of the
Company. Upon the request of Parent, as specified by Parent reasonably in
advance of the Closing, the Company will seek to obtain the resignation of
all directors of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, effective at the
Effective Time.

Section 8.15 _[_ Reserved].

Section 8.16 _No Bank Regulation_. The Company will not engage, and will not
permit any Company Subsidiary, to engage in any business or activity that
would have the effect of subjecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
regulation by any Governmental Entity with authority over banks, thrifts or
bank holding companies.

Section 8.17 _Company SEC Documents_. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries, to file with or publicly furnish to (as applicable) all
required reports, schedules, registration statements and other documents with
or to the SEC between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time ("
_Interim SEC Documents_ "). All Interim SEC Documents shall comply in all
material respects with the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and none of the
Interim SEC Documents shall, when filed with or publicly furnished to the
SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Company Financial Statements included in any such Interim
SEC Documents shall comply in all material respects with all applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, will be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or the entities purported to be
presented therein and the consolidated results of operations, changes in
shareholders equity and cash flows of such companies or entities as of the
dates and for the periods shown (subject, in the case of any unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
that, individually or in the aggregate do not have or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect).



 

56 Section 8.18 _Advisory Contract Consents_. The Company shall cause the Company
Adviser Subsidiaries ( _a_ ) to send, within a reasonable period following
the date hereof (but in any event at least forty-five (45) days prior to
Closing), a notice informing its advisory clients of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and requesting, in compliance with the
Advisers Act and any other Applicable Law, such clients consent as may be
necessary to effect the assignment, as such term is defined in the Advisers
Act, of their investment advisory agreements with the Company Adviser
Subsidiaries, and ( _b_ ) to use reasonable efforts to obtain such consent.
The Company may satisfy this obligation, insofar as it relates to
noninvestment company advisory clients (other than collective
investment arrangements as to which the governing instruments or Applicable
Law require any different or supplemental procedure, in which case such
different or supplemental procedures must be followed), by providing each such
client with the notice contemplated by the first sentence of this _Section
8.18_ and using reasonable efforts to obtain either a new investment advisory
agreement with such client effective at the Closing Date or such clients
consent by an actual written consent or by an implied consent to the
assignment of such clients investment advisory agreement in accordance with
the requirements of Applicable Law, provided that as to Kibble and Prentice
Holding Company, the Company shall seek actual written consent (not implied
consent) to the assignment and to the amendment to the advisory agreements
disclosed in Section 5.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter. It is understood
that such implied consent may be sought by means of a written notice (x)
requesting written consent, as aforesaid and (y) informing the advisory client
of: ( _i_ ) the transactions contemplated hereby and the Companys intention
to complete such transactions so as to result in a statutory assignment of
such investment advisory agreements; ( _ii_ ) the Company Adviser Subsidiarys
intention to continue the advisory services, under the existing investment
advisory agreement with such client after the Effective Time if such client
does not terminate such investment advisory agreement prior to the Effective
Time; and ( _iii_ ) the fact that if such client continues to accept such
advisory services without termination the consent of such client will be
implied effective as of the forty-fifth (45th) day following the date of such
notice.

Section 8.19 _Advice of Changes_. 

(a) Each party shall promptly advise the other orally and in writing of any
change or event that it becomes aware of having, or which would reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, or which would cause or
constitute a material breach of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants of the Company or any Company Subsidiary contained herein; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not
constitute the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in _Article
IX_ or give rise to any right of termination under _Article X_ unless
the underlying breach shall independently constitute such a failure or give
rise to such a right.

(b) Without limiting the rights of the parties in this _Section 8.19_ each
party shall furnish in advance to the other party copies of all
correspondence, filings, submissions and written communications between them
and their respective Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity, on the other hand, with  



 

57  respect to this Agreement or the Merger and consult with such other party on
and take into account any reasonable comments it may have to
such correspondence, filings, submissions and written communications prior to
them being made. Each party shall keep the other party apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall inform the other party of the substance of any material oral
communications with any Governmental Entity and shall respond to inquiries and
requests received from any Governmental Entity or third party, in each case
with respect to this Agreement or the Merger as promptly as practicable. In

or other communication from any Person (and the response thereto of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be) alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with this Agreement
or the Merger.

this Agreement not referenced in clause ( _a_ ) ( _ii_ ) above shall be true
and correct in all respects  



 

59  as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time as though made
on and as of such time (except to the extent that any such representation
and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all respects as of
such earlier date), interpreted without giving effect to the words
"materially" or "material" or to any qualifications based on such terms or
based on the defined term Company Material Adverse Effect, except where the
failure of all such representations and warranties to be true and correct, in
the aggregate, has not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have received a certificate of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company as to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ ;

not have accounted for more than ten percent (10%) of the total net fees and
commissions of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) reported in the Companys Financial Statements as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2006. For purposes of this _Section 9.3(c)_, an
individual will be deemed to have accounted for those net fees and
commissions that are coded to him or her, as producer, on the books and
records (including electronic database) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries that have been made available to Parent; and

(d) The Appraisal Shares shall not constitute more than ten percent (10%) of
the outstanding Common Shares of the Company immediately prior to

or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
9.1_ , _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied if
such failure was proximately caused by such partys failure to act in good
faith or to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject
to _Section 8.5_.

ARTICLE X

TERMINATION

Section 10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after approval of matters presented in connection with
the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof:

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;



 

60 (b) By either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the date that is nine (9) months (the " _Outside
Date_ ") after the date hereof (other than due principally to the failure of
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform any obligations under
this Agreement required to be performed by it at or prior to the Effective
Time); _provided_ that the passage of such period shall be tolled, until a
date not later than twelve (12) months after the date hereof, for any part
thereof during which any party shall be subject to a non-final order, decree,
ruling or action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation
of the Merger; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Outside Date may be extended
(one time only) for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days by either party
by written notice to the other party if the Merger shall not have been
consummated as a result of the condition set forth in _Section 9.1(c)_ failing
to have been satisfied one (1) Business Day prior to the Outside Date and the
extending party reasonably believes that the relevant approvals will be
obtained during such extension period;

(c) By Parent, if ( _i_ ) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have
occurred, ( _ii_ ) the Company shall have materially breached any of its
obligations under clause ( _a_ ) of _Section 8.3_ or Section _ 8.4_ or (
_iii_ ) the Company shall have breached any of its obligations under Section
8.3 (other than clause ( _a_ ) of _Section 8.3_) and such breach is not cured
within fifteen (15) Business Days after written notice thereof is given by
Parent to the Company;

(d) By Parent or the Company, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof;

(e) By Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling
or other action is or shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1_ shall not have taken any action that would cause it to be in material
violation of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in
this Agreement;

(f) By the Company, if there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this
Agreement such that _Section 9.2(a)_ would not be satisfied and such breach
is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of ( _i_ )
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by the Company to
Parent or ( _ii_ ) one (1) Business Day prior to the Outside Date; _provided_
that the Company is not then in breach of this Agreement such that any of the
conditions set forth in  _Section 9.3(a)_ would not be satisfied;

(g) By Parent, if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement such that
_Section 9.3(a)_ would not be satisfied and such breach is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of ( _i_ ) thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company or ( _ii_ ) one (1)
Business Day prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub
are not then in breach of this Agreement such that the conditions set forth
in  _Section 9.2(a)_ would not be satisfied;



 

61 (h) By the Company, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of
_Section 8.4(b)_; or

(i) by the Company, if all of the conditions set forth in  _Section 9.1_ and
_Section 9.3_ have been satisfied (unless the failure to satisfy any such
conditions is due to the failure by Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy their
respective obligations set forth herein) and Parent has failed to consummate
the Merger not later than five (5) calendar days after the final day of the
Marketing Period.

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void and have no effect and the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate, except for the obligations in the second to last
sentence of _Section 8.1_ , all of the provisions of _Section 5.14_ , this
_Section 10.2_ , _Section 10.3_ , _Article I_ and _Article XI_ and the
Guaranty set forth in  _Section 6.10_ and there shall be no liability on the
part of any party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ and
_Section 9.3(a)_ not to be satisfied.

Section 10.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(h)_
;

(ii)( _A_ ) prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, an
Alternative Transaction Proposal shall have been made to the Company
or directly to its stockholders generally or publicly announced and not
withdrawn, ( _B_ ) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_ and ( _C_ ) within twelve (12) months after
such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate or consummates an Alternative Transaction Proposal;

(iii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_; or

(iv)( _A_ ) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
10.1(g)_ (other than by reason of a breach of _Section 8.3_ or _Section
8.4_) and prior to such termination, an Alternative Transaction Proposal has
been made to the Company or directly to its stockholders or publicly
announced and not withdrawn and ( _B_ ) within twelve (12) months after such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate or
consummates an Alternative Transaction Proposal: 



 

62 then in each such case enumerated in ( _i_ ) through ( _iv_ ) above, the
Company shall pay Parent a one-time fee equal to forty-one million dollars
($41,000,000) (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "). Any fee due under this
_Section 10.3(a)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an
account provided in writing by Parent to the Company ( _A_ ) in the event
referred to in clause ( _i_ ) or ( _iii_ ) above, at or prior to the time of
termination of this Agreement or ( _B_ ) in the case of termination pursuant
to clause ( _ii_ ) or ( _iv_ ) above, within two (2) Business Days after the
earlier to occur of the Company entering into a definitive agreement to
consummate or the consummation of the Alternative Transaction Proposal
referred to in clause ( _ii_ )( _C_ ) or clause ( _iv_ )( _B_ ) above;
_provided_ that the provisions of this _Section 10.3(a)_ shall be subject to
_Section 10.3(c)_. For purposes of this _Section 10.3(a)_, the
term "Alternative Transaction Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in _Section 1.1(a)_, except that the reference to "fifteen percent
(15%)" in clauses ( _ii_ )-( _iv_ ) of the definition of "Alternative
Transaction Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "twenty-five
percent (25%)."

(b) Provided that the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.3_
have been satisfied (unless the failure to satisfy any such conditions is due
to the failure by Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy their respective obligations
set forth herein) and in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_ or _Section 10.1(i)_, Parent shall pay
a one-time fee equal to twenty-five million seven hundred thousand dollars
($25,700,000) (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") to the Company or as
directed by the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination), payable by
wire transfer of same day funds; _provided_ that the provisions of this
_Section 10.3(b)_ shall be subject to _Section 10.3(c)_.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the
Company would have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event
that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due or
Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, and in order to
obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, commences a
suit which results in a judgment against such other party for such fee, then
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall pay to the other party such
other partys reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses of enforcement) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at such
time, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus two percent (2%) per
annum from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date
actually received by such party. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to
the contrary, each party acknowledges that the Companys right to receive the
Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_ or the
guaranty thereof pursuant to the Guaranty shall constitute the Companys sole
and exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor or any Non-
Recourse Party (as defined in the Guaranty), or against any other party to any
Financing Commitment for, and such amount shall constitute liquidated damages
in respect of, the breach or termination of this Agreement regardless of
the circumstances giving rise to such breach or termination and the Company
shall have no further rights,  



 

63  directly or indirectly, against any Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor or any
Non-Recourse Party or against any party to any Financing Commitment, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as otherwise provided in Section 11.11.

(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party shall bear
its own Expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that ( _i_ ) Parent or the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 10.1(b) or 10.1(d)_ or
( _ii_ ) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(g)_,
then in each such case the Company, shall reimburse Parent for all Expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company pays Parents
Expenses pursuant to clause ( _i_ ) or ( _ii_ ) above and subsequent to
such termination the Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee
to Parent under _Section 10.3(a)_, the amount of the Company Termination Fee
shall be reduced by any Expenses theretofore reimbursed by the Company to
Parent. As used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " includes all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants to Parent and its
Affiliates) incurred by Parent or on its behalf in connection with or related
to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the amount required to be
reimbursed in respect of Expenses by the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, shall not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000) million.

Section 11.11 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur to Parent and Merger Sub in the event that any provision of
this Agreement was not performed by the Company in accordance with its
specific terms or  



 

67  was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Except to enforce the
penultimate sentence of  _Section 8.1_ or the last sentence of _Section
8.11(a)_, the parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this

seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from Parent,
Merger Sub and the Guarantors, and ( _C_ ) the maximum liability of each
Guarantor, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the express obligations

relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.
