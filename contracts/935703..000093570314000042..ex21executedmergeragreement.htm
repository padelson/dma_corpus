ARTICLE II.

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or common stock of Merger Sub:

(i) Common Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

(ii) Cancellation of Certain Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held
in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or
Merger Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to 

exist (the "Cancelled Shares"), and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(iii) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Cancelled Shares, any Dissenting Shares, and any share of Company Common Stock
held by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive: (A) $59.60 in cash (the
"Cash Consideration") and (B) a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (rounding to the nearest ten-
thousandth of a share) equal to the quotient (the "Exchange Ratio") determined
by dividing (x) $14.90 by (y) the Parent Trading Price; provided, however,
that if the Parent Trading Price is an amount greater than or equal to $59.98,
then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.2484, and if the Parent Trading Price is an
amount equal to or less than $49.08, then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.3036
(the "Stock Consideration" and, together with the Cash Consideration, the
"Merger Consideration"). Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by any direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into
such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in
the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the
ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash
Amount into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-
Entry Share or Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1,
as well as any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company
Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(e).

(b) Shares of Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock held by a person (a "Dissenting Stockholder") who has not voted in favor
of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all
the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares of
Company Common Stock to require appraisal of their shares (the "Appraisal
Provisions") of Company Common Stock ("Dissenting Shares"), to the extent the
Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a)(iii), but
shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand
for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal,
in any case pursuant to the DGCL, each of such Dissenting Stockholder's shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of
Company Common Stock had been 

converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(iii). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided, that nothing in
this Section 2.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

(d) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon the
conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii), and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the closing
price of Parent Common Stock reported on Nasdaq on the trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent by
(ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the
nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the "Fractional Share Cash
Amount"). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any
other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and shall enter into an agreement (the "Exchange Agent
Agreement") relating to the Exchange Agent's responsibilities under this
Agreement.

(b) Deposit of Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for
the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, (i) cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate Cash Consideration 

(together with, to the extent then determinable, the Fractional Share Cash
Amount) and (ii) evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form (and/or
certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, at Parent's election)
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver
the aggregate Stock Consideration (such cash and certificates, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund").

(c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable (and no later than
the third Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(iii) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall, subject to the Company's
reasonable approval, be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
shall reasonably designate) (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(e).

(d) Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with the
Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with
Section 2.2(e). In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the
Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the
case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such
surrender, the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement, together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or
other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(e).

(e) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date at or after the Effective Time with respect to Parent
Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of
Company Common Stock to be converted 

into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) until such
holder shall surrender such share in accordance with this Section 2.2. After
the surrender in accordance with this Section 2.2 of a share of Company Common
Stock to be converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(iii), the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to
the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount payable to such
holder pursuant to this Article II) any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to the Parent Common Stock represented by such share of Company Common
Stock.

(f) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The shares of Parent
Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares,
(i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section
2.2(d) (together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or
other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(e)), without interest, and (ii) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

(g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that
such investments shall be in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A‑1 or P‑1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or (iii) certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available); provided, further, that no
such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book- Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II, and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. Any interest
or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon
demand. 

(h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its
claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II without any
interest thereon.

(i) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or
the cash to be paid in accordance with this Article II that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, as of
immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

(j) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Company, Parent and the Exchange
Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

(k) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section
2.2(h), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.3 Company Stock Options and Company PSR Awards.

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to
the Company Stock Plan or otherwise that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a "Company Option") shall, as of the Effective Time,
be converted into an option to purchase, on the same substantive terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, an "Adjusted Option"), the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, 

determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company Option by the Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, equal to
the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by the Award Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Award Exchange Ratio" means the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii)

Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan or otherwise that is

converted into the right to receive, within 15 days following the Closing
Date, the Merger Consideration (without interest and less any applicable Tax
withholding) with respect to each share subject to the Company PSR Award, as
determined based on the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock deemed to be earned under the Company PSR Award based on the greater of
(x) the deemed achievement of all relevant performance goals at target level
and (y) the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance goals
against target as of the Company's last fiscal quarter end preceding the
Effective Time and (ii) a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the number
of days within the performance period of such Company PSR Award that have
elapsed prior to the Closing Date and (y) the denominator of which is the
total number of days within the performance period of such Company PSR Award;
provided, that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable
in respect of such Company PSR Award pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number.

(c) Each award of restricted stock units (other than any Company PSR Award) in
respect of shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan
or otherwise that is outstanding or payable as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Company RSU Award") shall, as of the Effective Time,
be converted into a restricted stock unit award (an "Adjusted RSU Award"), on
the same substantive terms and conditions as were applicable to the Company
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, in respect of the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole share, determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company RSU Award by the Award Exchange Ratio.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors and/or the
appropriate committee thereof shall take all reasonable actions, including
adopting any necessary resolutions or amendments with respect to the Company
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to effectuate the following: (i) to
cause the "Offering Period" (as defined in the ESPP) ongoing as of the date of
this Agreement to be the final Offering Period under the ESPP and the options
under the ESPP to be exercised on the earlier of (x) the scheduled purchase
date for such Offering Period and (y) the date that is seven Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (with any participant payroll deductions not applied
to the purchase of shares returned to the participant), (ii) to prohibit
participants in the ESPP from increasing their payroll deductions from those
in effect on the date of this Agreement and (iii) to terminate the ESPP
effective immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors and/or the
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for the
treatment of the Company Options, Company PSR Awards and Company RSU Awards
(collectively, the "Company Stock Awards") as contemplated by this Section
2.3. As soon as reasonably practical following the Effective Time, Parent
shall file one or more appropriate registration statements (on Form S‑3 or
Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to Parent
Common Stock underlying the Adjusted Options, Adjusted RSU Awards and in
respect of Parent Common Stock deliverable pursuant to Section 2.3(b). The
Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSU Awards may be issued, at Parent's election,
under either the Company Stock Plan or the Parent Stock Plans (or a
combination of both), provided that, in either case, the Adjusted Options and
Adjusted RSU Awards shall be subject to the same substantive terms and
conditions as were applicable to the related Company Options or Company RSU
Awards, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time. If any
Adjusted Options or Adjusted RSU Awards are granted under a Parent Stock Plan,
the Board of Directors of Parent and/or the appropriate committee thereof
shall adopt resolutions providing for the grant of the Adjusted Options or
Adjusted RSU Awards as contemplated by this Section 2.3 and any shares of
Parent Common Stock granted in settlement of such awards shall reduce the
available share pool under the applicable Parent Stock Plan.

Section 2.4 Further Assurances. If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Company and their respective officers and directors
shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments or

and (iii) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and
records of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. The books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,

all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the

Employer Plan") or (ii) subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. No circumstance exists that would reasonably be

knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit, against the Company, the Company Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans.
Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
(i) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA

of any indemnification obligation) any Liability under or pursuant to Title I
of ERISA or the penalty, excise Tax or joint and several Liability provisions

or condition has occurred or 

exists that would reasonably be expected to result in any such Liability to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates.

employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code.

documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code. The
Company is not party to, or otherwise obligated under, any contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of Taxes imposed
by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

(h) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any material
Liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event (i) entitle any current or former employee,
director, consultant or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay, accrued pension benefit or any other payment, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to
any such employee, director, consultant or officer, (iii) trigger any funding
obligation under any Company Benefit Plan or impose any restrictions or
limitations on the Company's rights to administer, amend or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan, or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that could,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code or otherwise. The Company has made available to
Parent all currently existing information applicable to the calculation of
"parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which information is complete
and accurate in all material respects and was used for purposes of calculating

Liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each Non-US Benefit Plan

for special tax treatment, meets all requirements of such treatment, and, in
each case, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred
that could adversely affect such registration or qualification.

threatened) against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective properties.

Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable
in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity). There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5 of and
Exhibit D to the Commitment Letter (such conditions precedent, the "Financing
Conditions").

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter has not been
amended or modified in any manner, and the respective commitments contained
therein have not been, to the knowledge of Parent, terminated, reduced,
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, to the knowledge of Parent, no such
termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated other than in
accordance with the terms thereof.

(d) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement and performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe
that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on or prior to
the Closing Date or (ii) the Financing will not be made available to Parent on
the Closing Date. 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not in default or breach under
the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition by Parent or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, under the terms and conditions
of the Commitment Letter.

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters,
understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the Financing
to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that could affect the
availability of the Financing on the Closing Date, other than those set forth
in the Commitment Letter.

(g) Parent or an Affiliate thereof on its behalf has fully paid any and all
commitment or other fees and amounts required by the Commitment Letter to be

payment of any debt required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled,
terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger
as of the date hereof (including all Indebtedness of the Company and its

or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger, including

be paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated costs and expenses of the
Merger on the Closing Date. In no event shall the receipt or availability of
any funds or financing (including the Financing) by or to Parent or any of its
Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, it being understood that
nothing in this Section 4.10(h) is intended to limit any condition set forth
in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3.

Section 4.11 Solvency. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby) and excluding the effect of any inaccuracy
of the representations and warranties contained in Article III, (a) Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have incurred debts beyond their
ability to pay such debts as they mature or become due, the then present fair
saleable value of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will exceed the amount that will be required to pay their probable Liabilities
(including the probable amount of all contingent Liabilities) and debts as
they become absolute and matured, (b) the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, at a fair valuation, will exceed their
probable Liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent

presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted.

conducted any 

operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities
convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company
Common Stock. Other than the Voting and Support Agreements, there are no
voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or
other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.14 No Vote of Parent Stockholders. No vote of the stockholders of
Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise)
is required by Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or
the applicable rules of the Nasdaq in order for Parent to issue shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or to consummate
the Merger.

Section 4.15 No Other Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Article IV or in any certificates delivered by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Closing, the Company acknowledges
that neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any person on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect
to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or with respect
to any other information provided or made available to the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including

Confidential Information" as defined therein. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 5.2(b), any document, correspondence or
information provided pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Merger or other
similarly confidential information. All access pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)
shall be (A) conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the normal operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (B) coordinated
through the General Counsel of Parent or a designee thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.2, no
party to this Agreement nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide any access, or make available any document, correspondence or
information, if doing so would, in such party's and its outside legal counsel
reasonable judgment, (i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such
party or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) conflict with any (A) Law applicable
to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or the assets, or operation of the
business, of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) Contract to which
such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of the their
assets or properties are bound; provided, however, that in such instances such
party shall inform the other party of the general nature of the information
being withheld and, upon the other party's request, reasonably cooperate with
the other party to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner
that would not result in any of the outcomes described in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party to this

no party to this Agreement shall have any right to perform invasive or
subsurface investigations of the properties or facilities of the other party
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) No investigation by Parent or its representatives shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the Company

Agreement.

(e) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of April 7, 2014, between the Company and Parent (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

Section 5.3 No Solicitation.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its controlled Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its financial advisors, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives (collectively with its
controlled Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents, 

"Representatives") to: (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent) that may be
ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and (B) not, directly or
indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal, (2) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any information in
connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, a Company
Takeover Proposal (other than, solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry,
to refer the inquiring person to this Section 5.3 and to limit its
conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral), or (3)
approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or enter
into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or
agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, promptly
request (to the extent it has not already done so prior to the date of this
Agreement) any person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreement in connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal
that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or destroy
all confidential information of the Company or its controlled Affiliates in
the possession of such person or its Representatives. The Company shall not,
and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, release any third party
from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under,
(1) any standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of
its controlled Affiliates is a party or (2) any confidentiality provision in
any agreement to which the Company or any of its controlled Affiliates is a
party other than, with respect to this clause (2), any waiver, amendment,
modification or permission under a confidentiality provision that does not,
and would not be reasonably likely to, facilitate, knowingly encourage or
relate in any way to a Company Takeover Proposal or a potential Company
Takeover Proposal; provided, that if the Company Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any such
standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to
make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board of Directors, a Company
Takeover Proposal, conditioned upon such third party agreeing that the Company
shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent (including
regarding any such Company Takeover Proposal) in accordance with, and
otherwise complying with, this Section 5.3. Except to the extent otherwise
permitted by the proviso in the foregoing sentence, the Company shall, and
shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, enforce the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any such agreement, and the Company shall, and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates to, immediately take all steps within their
power necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted,
to any person other than Parent or any of Parent's Affiliates, under any such
provisions. The Company shall not (i) except as provided in Section 3.24,
terminate (or permit the termination of), waive or amend the Rights Agreement,
(ii) redeem any Rights under the Rights Agreement or (iii) take any action
with respect to, or make any determination under, the Rights Agreement that
would interfere with Parent consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case without the prior written consent of Parent. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), if
at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives,
receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any
person that did not result from the Company's, its controlled Affiliates' or
their respective Representatives' knowing or intentional breach of Section
5.3, and if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
the Company and its Representatives may, (A) furnish, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
who has made such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives; provided,
that the Company shall concurrently with the delivery to such person provide
to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided to Parent and (B) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours) notify Parent and Merger
Sub if the Company furnishes non-public information and/or enters into
discussions or negotiations as provided in this Section 5.3(c).

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four hours
after receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any
of its Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a request for
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is reasonably
likely to lead to or that contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including
the identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the
material terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy of such
Company Takeover Proposal or, where such Company Takeover Proposal is not in
writing, a description of the terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a current basis, as to the status of (including any
material developments, discussions or negotiations) such Company Takeover
Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four hours
after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any written correspondence,
proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such
Company Takeover Proposal). The Company agrees that it and its Affiliates will
not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this Section 5.3.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(e), the Company Board of
Directors shall not (i) (A) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation
or (B) adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company, a
Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (ii) authorize,
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, 

memorandum of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or
agreement in principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
Section 5.3(b)) (a "Company Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board of
Directors may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change under clause (A) of
such definition if and only if, both (1) solely in response to an Intervening
Event (and not in response to a Company Takeover Proposal) and (2) prior to
taking such action, the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Company Board of Directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (x)
the Company has given Parent at least five Business Days' prior written notice
of its intention to take such action, and specifying, in reasonable detail,
the reasons therefor, (y) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would permit the Company
Board of Directors not to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) and (z) upon the end of such notice period,
the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that the Company Board of Directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law continue to require a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change under clause (A) of such definition.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained, but not after, if the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that (i) a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a knowing or intentional breach of Section
5.3 constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to approve or
recommend such Company Superior Proposal, or enter into a definitive agreement
relating to such Company Superior Proposal, would be inconsistent with the
Company Board of Directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company
Board of Directors may, subject to compliance with this Section 5.3(f), cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive
agreement relating to such Company Superior Proposal upon (and subject to)
paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3; provided,
however, that prior to so terminating this Agreement, (A) the Company has
given Parent at least five Business Days' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, and specifying the reasons therefor, including
the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such
Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy
of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition
Agreements and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto (or, in
each case, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the
terms thereof), (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a 

Company Superior Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Company
Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent
were to be given effect and that the failure to approve or recommend such
Company Superior Proposal, or enter into a definitive agreement relating to
such Company Superior Proposal, would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (D) in the event of any change to
any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment
of consideration) or any other material terms of such Company Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this
proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall
commence (except that the five Business Day notice period referred to in
clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (1)
two Business Days and (2) the period remaining under the notice period under
clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(f) anew with
respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of
this proviso; and provided, further, that the Company has complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.3. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) from making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d‑9(f) under the Exchange Act; provided, that in no event shall the Company
or the Company Board of Directors take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by this Section 5.3.

Section 5.4 Filings; Other Actions.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after
such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, but in no event earlier than the
record date set by the Company. Parent shall also take any action required to
be taken under any applicable state or provincial securities laws in
connection with the issuance and reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock
in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial
interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or 

the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or response to SEC comments with respect
thereto, will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the
other's prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) and without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon; provided, however, that the Company, in connection
with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, may amend or supplement the Form
S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to effect such change (it being
understood that any such amendment or supplement shall solely contain (i) such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) a statement of the reasons of
the Company Board of Directors for making such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and, in such event, the right of consent set forth in this Section
5.4(a) shall apply only with respect to such information relating to Parent or
its business, financial condition or results of operations). Parent or the
Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral
or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly
provide the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any
state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not
include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

(b) Subject to Section 5.3(f), the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to
set a record date for, duly give notice of, convene and, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, hold a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(the "Company Stockholders' Meeting"). Except as expressly permitted by
Section 5.3, the Company Board of Directors shall not make any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and shall include its recommendation that the Company's
stockholders vote in favor of the Merger in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
shall solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders' Meeting. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholders'
Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section
7.1.

(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a current
basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its stockholders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (i) to the
extent required by applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time for which the
Company 

Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders' Meeting or (iii) with the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). In addition, if at any time following the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, either the Company or Parent
reasonably determines in good faith that the Company Stockholder Approval is
unlikely to be obtained at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, then on a single
occasion and prior to the vote contemplated having been taken, each of the
Company and Parent shall have the right to require a single adjournment or
postponement of the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided, that no such
adjournments or postponements shall delay the Company Stockholders' Meeting by
more than 45 days from the originally scheduled date. During any such period
of adjournment or postponement, the Company shall continue in all respects to
comply with its obligations under Section 5.3 and this Section 5.4.

Section 5.5 Employee Matters.

(a) Subject to the exception set forth on Section 5.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, effective as of the Effective Time and until at least
December 31, 2015, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company
to provide, to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue to be
employed by Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") for so
long as the applicable Company Employee remains employed by Parent or the
Surviving Company, compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation opportunities
and employee benefits paid or provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries);
provided, that for purposes of the foregoing sentence the compensation
opportunities and employee benefits generally provided to employees of the
Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be
substantially comparable, on an aggregate basis, to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
this sentence, it being understood that the Company Employees may commence
participation in Parent's compensation and benefit plans on different dates
following the Effective Time with respect to different benefit plans.

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Parent
or the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries in which the Company Employees
are eligible to participate following the Closing Date (collectively, the
"Post-Closing Plans") to recognize the service of each Company Employee with
the Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility vesting and
benefit accrual under such Post-Closing Plans; provided, that such recognition
of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any defined benefit retirement
plan or plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate
any benefits of a Company Employee with respect to the same period of service
or (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under
which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not
receive credit for prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to any
Post-Closing Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits,
for the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to
participate, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any 

preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
plan to be waived with respect to such Company Employee to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (B) credit each Company Employee for an amount equal to any medical,
dental or vision expenses incurred by such Company Employee in the Post-
Closing Plan year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in
which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate in such Post-
Closing Plan) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan, subject to the
applicable information being provided to Parent in a form that Parent
reasonably determines is administratively feasible to take into account under
its plans. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any annual or
lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply
under the terms of the applicable plan. Unused vacation days accrued by
Company Employees under the plans and policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall carry over to Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, and each Company Employee shall be
paid by the Company in cash for any accrued and unused vacation days that
Parent and the Company mutually determine are not permitted by applicable Law
to be carried over.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, honor all accrued and vested benefits under the Company
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before
the Effective Time and applicable Law as such agreements and arrangements may
be modified or terminated in accordance with their terms from time to time.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries)
or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date,
Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 5.5 shall
create any third party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or current
or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 5.6 Regulatory Approvals; Efforts.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable 

Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger including (i) the preparation
and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Merger, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating
the Merger, (iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and
cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental
Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary
material required under the HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) defending and seeking to prevent the initiation of all
actions, suits and other proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and causing to be lifted or rescinded any Order or other
action by any Governmental Authority adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to consummate the Merger and (v) the execution and delivery of any
reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to fulfill all
conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take any action after the
date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay
the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or
consent from any such Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to
Closing.

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.6. In that regard, prior to the
Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this
Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance
as the other parties may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case
of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) copies of) all
notices, submissions, or filings made by such party with any Governmental
Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.
Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in
the case of oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any
communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and
permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed
communication with any such Governmental Entity. Without limiting the
foregoing or any of the other provisions of this Section 5.6, the parties
agree that, it is Parent's sole right to devise the strategy for filings,
notifications, submissions and communications with or to any antitrust
regulatory authority. If any party to this Agreement or any Representative of
such parties receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, then such
party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly
and after consultation with the other parties to this Agreement, an
appropriate response in substantial compliance with such request. No party
shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental
Entity where material issues or any matters relating to timing would likely be
discussed in connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless it consults
with the other parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental 

Entity, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat. Without limiting the foregoing obligations (other than the fourth
sentence of this Section 5.6(b)), each party shall, on a current basis,
furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger, and furnish the other parties with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Entity; provided, however, that Parent
and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 5.6(b) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 5.6, materials provided pursuant to this
Section 5.6 may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company and the Merger or other similarly confidential information,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR
Act. In the event that the parties receive a request for information or
documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a "Second Request"), the parties
will, unless Section 6.1(e) has been satisfied earlier, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to certify compliance with such Second Request as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within three months after receipt
thereof) and to produce documents on a rolling basis, and counsel for both
parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request
review process.

(d) Without limiting Section 5.6(a) and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall, solely to the extent
necessary or advisable to permit the satisfaction of Section 6.1(b) and
Section 6.1(e) so as to permit the Closing to occur by the End Date, propose,
negotiate, effect and agree to the sale, divestiture, license, holding
separate, and other disposition of and restriction on retail stores of Parent
and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries)
and take such action or actions that would in the aggregate have a similar
effect; provided, that (A) any such sales, divestitures, licenses, holdings,
dispositions, restrictions or similar effects become effective only from and
after the Effective Time and (B) under no circumstances shall Parent, pursuant
to its undertakings herein relating to the satisfaction of Section 6.1(b) or
Section 6.1(e), be required to propose, negotiate, effect and agree to the
sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, or other disposition of or
restriction on an aggregate of more than 500 retail stores of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) or take
such action or actions that would in the aggregate have a similar effect.

Section 5.7 Takeover Statutes. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take
any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be subject to requirements imposed by any takeover statute. If any
"moratorium," "control share 

acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.8 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties and that the
parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public announcement with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but
after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)
issue such press release or make such public statement to the extent required
by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange; provided,
further, that in the event of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in
compliance with Section 5.3, the Company may make a public statement
containing (i) such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) a statement
of the reasons of the Company Board of Directors for making such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and, in such event, the right of consent set
forth in this Section 5.8 shall apply only with respect to such information
relating to Parent or its business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Section 5.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless each present
and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in
each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, together with their
respective heirs, executors and administrators, the "Company Directors and
Officers ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages, amounts paid in settlement or other
Liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an "Indemnified Action"), arising out of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or, at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, of any other person) at any time at or before the
Effective Time, whether pertaining to matters existing or occurring or actions
or omissions taken (or alleged to have existed, occurred or been taken) at or
after the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and
the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
also advance expenses to the Company Directors and Officers in connection with
any and all such Indemnified Actions as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law; provided, that each of the Company Directors and
Officers to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is 

ultimately determined by a final and nonappealable judicial determination that
such Company Director or Officer is not entitled to indemnification under this
Section 5.9(a) or otherwise.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to agree, and the Company agrees,
that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
now existing in favor of any Company Director or Officer or any current or
former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (together with their
heirs, executors and administrators, and the Company Directors and Officers,
the "Company Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company Organizational
Documents (or the Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof (i) with any
Company Director or Officer or (ii) set forth on Section 5.9(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to agree, and the
Company agrees, to maintain in effect the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions of the Company Organizational Documents
(and the Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) now in effect and any
such indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with the
Company Indemnified Parties and not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
such Company Indemnified Parties, and all such rights in respect of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or asserted or claim made or
threatened within such period shall continue until the final disposition or
resolution thereof.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause to be maintained
in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company (provided, that the Surviving Company may substitute
therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events, or actions or omissions, which occurred or are alleged to have
occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that the
Surviving Company shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments in
respect of any one policy year for such insurance to the extent such premiums
exceed 250 % of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company
for such insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Company's good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent, or the Company
after prior consultation with Parent, may obtain at or prior to the Effective
Time a six‑year prepaid "tail" policy under the Company's existing directors'
and officers' insurance policy providing coverage no greater than the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company; provided, that the Company shall not purchase such prepaid "tail"
policy for a total cost in excess of 300% of the then current annual premium
paid by the Company for such insurance (the "Tail Cap") without the prior
written consent of Parent; provided, further, that if the total cost for such
prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the Tail Cap, then Parent or the Company, after
prior consultation with Parent, may obtain a prepaid "tail" policy with the
maximum coverage available for a total cost not to exceed the Tail Cap. 

(d) The rights of each Company Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Company
Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational Documents (or
Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents), any other Contract, any Law or
otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the Effective Time
and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, are intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company
Indemnified Party and his or her representatives.

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and employees, and this Section 5.9 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

Section 5.10 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other party's
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

Section 5.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12 Financing and Financing Cooperation.

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or
proper to obtain the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms
and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable
best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect and enforce the Commitment Letter and
comply with its obligations thereunder (provided, that the Commitment Letter
may be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as set forth below); (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis and in a manner that will not impede the ability of
the parties to consummate the Merger in advance of the End Date all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to the funding of the Financing (including
the Financing Conditions) set forth in the 

Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements executed in connection
therewith within Parent's control (other than any condition where the failure
to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Company's failure to furnish
information to Parent or otherwise to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement) and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions). Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a regular basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing and shall give the Company prompt notice
of any fact, change, event or circumstance that has had or is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact
with respect to the Financing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub
to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, the
Commitment Letter without the Company's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that
Parent and Merger Sub may, without the Company's prior written consent, (x)
enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter that would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of
the Financing or the Merger; and (y) amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement so long as any such addition would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Financing or the Merger (it being understood that any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification that provides for the
assignment of a portion of the Financing commitments to any additional
lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities
and the granting to such persons of approval rights in accordance with the
term of the syndication provisions of the Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement as are customarily granted to additional agents or arrangers,
shall be permitted hereunder and shall be deemed to not prevent, materially
delay or materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Merger).
Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification, the term
"Commitment Letter" shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies
of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver
of the Commitment Letter.

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
offerings or other incurrences of debt (including unsecured notes) for all or
any portion of the Financing by reducing commitments under the Commitment
Letter; provided, that to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special or
mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earlier
of the consummation of the Merger on the Closing Date, the termination of this
Agreement or the End Date (for the avoidance of doubt as it may be extended
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as in effect on the date hereof).
Further, Parent shall have the right to substitute commitments in respect of
other financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or
alternative bona fide third-party financing sources so long as all conditions
precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such 

financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to funding of such
financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding,
substantially equivalent to (or more favorable to the Company than) the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 5 and Exhibit D to of the Commitment
Letter (any such financing which satisfies the foregoing clause, the
"Alternative Financing"; the definitive documentation for any such Alternative
Financing, the "Alternative Financing Documents").

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with any financing by Parent or any of its Affiliates
in connection with the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to (i) furnish the
report of the Company's independent accountants on the most recently available
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and obtain the consent of such accountants to the use of such report in
accordance with normal custom and practice and cause such accountants to
provide customary comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort) to
the underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, in
connection with any such financing; (ii) furnish such customary financial
statements, schedules or other financial data or information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than any pro forma financial information
which shall be covered by clause (vi)(2) below) reasonably requested by Parent
or its Representatives as may be necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the Financing or the Alternative Financing, including financial statements,
financial data and other information (x) if Parent has elected to undertake a
registered public offering, of the type required by Regulation 
S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act for a registered
public offering by Parent or (y) if Parent has elected to undertake a Rule
144A offering, customary for Rule 144A offerings by first time issuers in
order to consummate the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, in each case, meeting the respective requirements of the
condition set forth in paragraph 7 of Exhibit D to the Commitment Letter (the
applicable "Offering Requirements"), or as otherwise necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with the Financing or Alternative Financing or as
otherwise necessary in order to assist in receiving customary "comfort"
(including "negative assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in
connection with the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, in each case in advance of the Marketing Period (all such
information in this clause (ii) and, to the extent required to satisfy the
condition set forth in paragraph 7 of Exhibit D to the Commitment Letter, a

independent accountants would be prepared to deliver upon completion of
customary procedures in connection with Financing, collectively, the "Required
Information"); (iii) facilitate contact between (x) senior management and
advisors, including auditors, of the Company and (y) the proposed lenders,

under the Commitment Letter; (vi) provide assistance in the preparation of (1)

reflecting the Merger and the Financing; (vii) assist Parent in ensuring that
the syndication efforts benefit from the existing banking relationships of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; (viii) permit the reasonable use by Parent and

and underwriting, as applicable, of the Financing, provided, that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks;
(ix) participate as necessary in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, customary one-on-one sessions that are requested in advance and

connection with the Financing or the Alternative Financing; (x) assist in
preparing customary rating agency presentations and participating in a
reasonable number of sessions with rating agencies in connection with the

and regulations, including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as
amended; and (xv) not commence or effect any offering, placement or
arrangement of any debt securities or bank financing competing with the
Financing (and not permit any such offering, placement or arrangements to
occur on its behalf) (other than any indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries permitted to be to be incurred or outstanding pursuant to the
other provisions of this Agreement) if such issuance, offering, placement or
arrangement would reasonably be expected to materially impair the syndication
of the Financing or the offering of the securities 

contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the related engagement letter;
provided that (x) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be

information as may be necessary so that the marketing materials for the
Financing are complete and correct in all material respects and do not and
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which such statements are made, not materially
misleading.

(e) In connection with any Financing in the form of an underwritten offering
of debt securities, the Company shall: (i) as soon as monthly information on
the Company's financial performance becomes available to the Company's senior
management following the end of any month, provide Parent with such
information upon request by Parent (including providing Parent with the

or (z) pass resolutions or consents or approve or authorize the execution of
the Financing or the definitive financing agreements, (ii) any requested

to information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives), except in the event such loss or damage arises out of or
results from the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or
intentional breach of its obligations hereunder by the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

Section 5.13 Treatment of Certain Indebtedness.

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to commence, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the receipt of a written request from Parent to
do so subsequent to the date of this Agreement (and only upon receipt of such

Offer (collectively, the "Change of Control Offer Documents") a reasonable
period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Change of Control
Offer, (B) Parent will consult with the Company regarding the timing and
commencement of any Change of Control Offer in light of the regular financial
reporting schedule of the Company, the requirements of applicable Law,
including SEC rules and regulations, any material non-public information known

reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to,
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any
Change of Control Offer; provided, however, that nothing herein shall (x) be

Indenture to make a Change of Control Offer, (y) require such cooperation to
the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, or (z) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

(a) The Company and Parent shall each promptly advise the other party of any
fact, change, event or circumstance that has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to give rise to a failure of a condition precedent set forth
in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) (in the case of Parent or Merger Sub) or
Section 6.3(a), Section 6.3(b) or Section 6.3(c) (in the case of the Company);
provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 5.17 or the
failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 to be
satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2
or Section 6.3 to be satisfied.

(b) The Company and Parent shall each promptly advise the other party of (i)
any written notice or other written communication from any person alleging
that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this 

Agreement to the extent that the party receiving such notice or communication
believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the failure to obtain such
consent would have a material impact on the timing of the consummation of the
Merger or on the Company, the Surviving Company or Parent or (ii) upon
receiving any written communication from any Governmental Entity or third
party whose consent or approval is required for the satisfaction of one of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent or
approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent or
approval will be materially delayed. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any written notice or other written communication received following the
date hereof from any party to any Company Material Contract to the effect that
such party has terminated or intends to terminate or otherwise materially
adversely modify its relationship with any Company or Company Subsidiary as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after any approval of
the Merger by the stockholders of the Company:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or prior to April 27, 2015 (the "End Date"); provided, however,
that if all of the conditions to Closing, other than the conditions set forth
in Section 6.1(e), shall have been satisfied or shall be capable of being
satisfied at such time and/or the Marketing Period has not expired, the End
Date shall automatically be extended to July 27, 2015; and provided, further,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 

Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to a party if the failure of the Closing
to occur by such date shall be due to the material breach by such party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such party set forth
in this Agreement;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if an order by a Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have been issued permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
order shall have become final and nonappealable;

(d) by either the Company or Parent, if the Company Stockholders' Meeting (as
it may be adjourned or postponed) shall have concluded and the Company
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

(e) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it
occurred or was continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) and (ii)
which is either not curable or is not cured by the earlier of (A) the End Date
and (B) the date that is thirty days following written notice from the Company
to Parent describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail (provided,
that the Company is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein);

(f) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it occurred or was
continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.3(a), Section 6.3(b) or Section 6.3(c) and
(ii) which is either not curable or is not cured by the earlier of (A) the End
Date and (B) the date that is thirty days following written notice from the
Company to Parent describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail
(provided, that Parent is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein);

the event the Company shall have failed to include the Company Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus distributed to its stockholders, (ii) at any
time following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (iii) in the event
that a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes a Company Takeover
Proposal shall have been commenced by a person unaffiliated with Parent or
Merger Sub and the Company shall not have published, sent or given to its
stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, within the ten
Business Day period (as specified in Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act) after
such tender offer or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, or
subsequently amended in any material respect, a statement recommending that
stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer and affirming the
Company Recommendation, or (iv) if the Company shall have committed a Willful
and Material Breach of any of its material obligations under Section 5.3 or
Section 5.4; and

(h) by the Company, in accordance with Section 5.3(f). 

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall terminate (except that
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement and
the provisions of Section 5.12(f), Section 5.13(h), Section 5.13(i), Section
7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII shall survive any termination), and there
shall be no other Liability on the part of the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, to the other except (i) as provided
in Section 5.12(f), Section 5.13(h), Section 5.13(i), and Section 7.3 or (ii)
Liability arising out of or resulting from fraud or any Willful and Material
Breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination, in

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 7.1(d), the Company shall pay Parent the amount (not to exceed
$90,000,000) of out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Parent in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, by
wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available
funds within two Business Days after such termination. If (i) this Agreement
is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h), (ii) this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g), or (iii) (A) a Pre-
Termination Takeover Proposal shall have occurred at any time following the
date of this Agreement and prior to the event giving rise to the right to
terminate this Agreement and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent
or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and (B) either (1) both (x) at any time on or prior
to the twelve month anniversary of such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any
transaction included within the definition of Company Takeover Proposal (a
"Company Takeover Transaction") (whether or not involving the same Company
Takeover Proposal as that which was the subject of the Pre-Termination
Takeover Proposal Event) and (y) at any time on or prior to the twenty-four
month anniversary of the date of the definitive agreement contemplated by
clause (x), the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates a Company
Takeover Transaction (whether or not involving the same party that entered
into the definitive agreement contemplated by the foregoing clause (x)) or (2)
at any time on or prior to the twelve month anniversary of such termination,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates a Company Takeover
Transaction, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee (less any amount
previously paid pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.3(a) in
respect of a termination by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)), by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately
available funds in the case of clause (i), in accordance with Section 5.3(f),
in the case of clause (ii), within two Business Days of such termination, or
in the case of clause (iii), upon consummation of the Company Takeover
Transaction contemplated by clause (1)(y) or (2); provided, that for the
purposes of clause (B) only, all references in the definition of Company
Takeover Proposal to "15%" shall instead be references to "50%."

(b) For purposes of this Section 7.3, a "Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal
Event" shall be deemed to occur if a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
made known to the Company's Board of Directors or senior management or shall
have been made directly to the Company's stockholders generally or any bona
fide acquiror (or Representative thereof acting on behalf of a bona fide
acquiror) shall have publicly announced a Company Takeover Proposal with
respect to the Company, and in any such case such Company Takeover Proposal
shall not have been withdrawn prior to the event giving rise to such
termination (or in the case of 

a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d), at least five Business Days prior to
the Company Stockholders' Meeting) (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that a person shall be a bona fide acquiror if it possesses or could
reasonably be believed to have access to the resources necessary to consummate
such Company Takeover Proposal).

(c) "Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to $305,000,000.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the full
Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this Section
7.3, from and after such termination and payment of the Termination Fee in
full pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 7.3, the Company shall
have no further Liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this
Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under
this Section 7.3, except in the case of fraud or a Willful and Material Breach
by the Company of this Agreement (it being understood that, without limiting
the foregoing, in the case of fraud or a Willful and Material Breach, any
prior payment of the Termination Fee shall be taken into account when
determining any remedies). Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the
Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such Termination Fee is due and payable and which do
not involve fraud or Willful and Material Breach, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled
to payment of the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due
pursuant to Section 7.3(a), then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for
all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii)
the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount from and including the
date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual
payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

ARTICLE VIII.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.1 No Survival. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Merger, except for covenants and agreements
which contemplate performance after the Effective Time or otherwise expressly
by their terms survive the Effective Time.

Section 8.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
(including in Section 5.12(e), Section 5.13(h), Section 5.13(i) and Section
7.3), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement

to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form,
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and

arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

Section 8.5 Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement.

(a) The parties' rights in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party hereby waives any
objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 8.5. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
money damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be available
to it, including monetary damages, each of the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and
remedies shall be cumulative, except, in each case, as may be limited by
Section 7.3). In the event any party seeks any remedy referred to in this
Section 8.5, such party shall not be required to prove damages or obtain,
furnish, provide or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.5 and
each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right
it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, providing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument. In addition, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and 

determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding
for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, (b) any
claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties
hereto hereby consents to the service of process in accordance with Section
8.7; provided, however, that nothing herein shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(b) NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE
FINANCING OR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE

SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR

OF MANHATTAN, AND (II) THEY SHALL NOT BRING OR PERMIT ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES
TO BRING OR SUPPORT ANYONE ELSE IN BRINGING ANY SUCH CLAIM, SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER COURT.

Section 8.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
