AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of October 11, 2005 is made by and among Team Health Holdings, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), Team Health, Inc., a Tennessee corporation and majority-owned subsidiary of the Company (" _Team_ "), Team Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (" _Team Finance_ "), Team Health MergerSub, Inc., a Tennessee corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Team Finance (" _Team MergerSub_ "), Ensemble Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Purchaser_ "), and Ensemble Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser (" _PurchaserSub_ "). Certain capitalized terms used herein have the meanings set forth in  _Article 10_. 

   

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the stockholders of PurchaserSub seek to acquire a controlling interest in the Company through a transaction intended by Purchaser to be accounted for as a recapitalization; 

   

 WHEREAS, in connection with such recapitalization, it is also necessary to effect a reorganization of Team in which Team MergerSub will merge with and into Team, with (a) the Team Common Shares held by stockholders of Team, other than the Company, being converted into Company Common Units, (b) the Team Common Shares held by the Company being cancelled and (c) the shares of common stock of Team MergerSub being converted into shares of common stock of the surviving corporation of the merger, such that Team will become a direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of Team Finance and an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TBCA; 

   

 WHEREAS, the recapitalization will involve a merger, to be consummated immediately after the Reorganization Merger, in which PurchaserSub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company Common Units (subject to certain exceptions described in this Agreement) being converted into the right to receive cash and the shares of PurchaserSub being converted into common units of the Surviving Company, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the LLC Act; 

   

 WHEREAS, the board of managers of the Company, the managing member of Team Finance, the board of directors of Team and the managers of Purchaser and PurchaserSub have each approved and adopted this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the acquisition of the Company and, thereby, the acquisition of Team by Purchaser to be effected by the foregoing mergers; 

   

 WHEREAS, Team Finance, as the sole stockholder of Team MergerSub, has duly approved and adopted this Agreement, the Reorganization Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, in accordance with the TBCA; 

   

 WHEREAS, the requisite members of the Company and Purchaser, as the sole stockholder of PurchaserSub, have duly approved and adopted this Agreement, the Recapitalization Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, in accordance with the LLC Act; and 

    ##### 

  

     

 WHEREAS, as an inducement for the Company, Team, Team Finance and Team MergerSub to enter into this Agreement, Blackstone Capital Partners IV L.P., currently the sole member of Purchaser, has, on the date hereof, executed and delivered to the Company a limited guaranty (the " _Guaranty_ ") of the obligations of Purchaser and PurchaserSub hereunder. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE 1 
 THE REORGANIZATION MERGER 

   

 SECTION 1.01. The Reorganization Merger. 

   

 (a) At the Reorganization Effective Time, Team MergerSub shall be merged with and into Team in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TBCA (the " _Reorganization Merger_ "), at which time the separate existence of Team MergerSub shall cease and Team shall continue its existence. In its capacity as the corporation surviving the Reorganization Merger, Team is sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_." 

   

 (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereby, waiver of all conditions to the Recapitalization Merger set forth herein (other than the occurrence of the Reorganization Merger), Team and Team MergerSub shall cause articles of merger, substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Reorganization Certificate of Merger_ "), to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee (the " _Tennessee Secretary_ ") and make all other filings or recordings required by the TBCA in connection with the Reorganization Merger. The " _Reorganization Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time that the Reorganization Certificate of Merger is filed with the Tennessee Secretary (unless a later date and/or time is otherwise agreed upon by the parties and specified in an amendment to this Agreement, in which case, the Reorganization Effective Time shall be the date and time so specified). 

   

 (c) From and after the Reorganization Effective Time, the Reorganization Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 48-21-108 of the TBCA. 

   

 (d) The closing of the Reorganization Merger shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York (or such other place as agreed by the parties) immediately prior to the Closing, unless the parties hereto agree on another date or time. 

   

 SECTION 1.02. Organizational Documents. At the Reorganization Effective Time (i) the certificate of incorporation of Team in effect at the Reorganization Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and (ii) the by-laws of Team in effect immediately prior to the Reorganization Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.03. Directors and Officers. From and after the Reorganization Effective Time (until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified), Team MergerSubs 

    ##### 

  

    

directors at the Reorganization Effective Time shall be the Surviving
Corporations directors and Teams officers at the Reorganization Effective
Time shall be the Surviving Corporations officers. 

   

 SECTION 1.04. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Reorganization Effective Time and by virtue of the Reorganization Merger and without any action on the part of Team, Team MergerSub or Team Finance or their respective equity holders: 

   

 (a) Each share of common stock, no par value share, of Team MergerSub outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) Each share of Common Stock, no par value per share, of Team (each, a " _Team Common Share_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization Effective Time held by the Company shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

   

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in _Sections 1.04(d)_ and _(e)_ , each Team Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the Reorganization Effective Time held by any Person other than the Company (each a " _Team Converting Holder_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive one (1) Company Common Unit. The Company Common Units issued pursuant to this _Section 1.04(c)_ are referred to herein as the " _Reorganization Merger Consideration_." All such Team Common Shares, when so converted pursuant to this _Section 1.04(c)_, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. Each holder of Team Common Shares converted pursuant to this _Section 1.04(c)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, without interest, the applicable Reorganization Merger Consideration. 

   

 (d) Each Team Common Share held by Team as treasury stock immediately prior to the Reorganization Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

   

 (e) Each Team Common Share owned by any Subsidiary of Team immediately prior to the Reorganization Effective Time shall automatically be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 SECTION 1.05. Exchange of Certificates. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. The Company shall act as exchange agent for the purpose of effectuating the exchange of the Reorganization Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article 1_ for stock certificates (" _Team Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Reorganization Effective Time represented outstanding Team Common Shares, which were converted into the right to receive the Reorganization Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. At the Reorganization Effective Time, the Company shall make the Reorganization Merger Consideration available to the Team Converting Holders for exchange in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. At the Reorganization Effective Time, upon surrender to the Company by a Team Converting Holder of 

    ##### 

  

    

Team Certificates representing the number of Team Common Shares held by such
holder, together with a duly executed and completed Transmittal Letter and
such other documentation evidencing such holders ownership of such
Team Common Shares as may reasonably be requested by the Company, such holder
of such Team Certificates shall be entitled to immediately receive in
exchange therefor the portion of the Reorganization Merger Consideration
(less any required withholding Taxes) to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this _Article 1_ in respect of the Team Common Shares
represented by such Team Certificate. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 1.05_, each Team Certificate shall be deemed upon and at any
time after the Reorganization Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the appropriate amount of the Reorganization Merger Consideration
without interest as provided in this _Article 1_. If any portion of the
Reorganization Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Team Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that the Team Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Company, on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation, any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of
such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Team Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Company that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any Team Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact
and (ii) providing to the Surviving Corporation a personal indemnity against
any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Company
with respect to such Team Certificate by the Person claiming such Team
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company will deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Team Certificate, the appropriate
amount of Reorganization Merger Consideration, as contemplated by this
_Article 1_. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Team Common Shares_. All Reorganization Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of Team Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Team Common Shares represented thereby. As of the Reorganization Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Team shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on Teams stock transfer books of the Team Common Shares formerly owned by the Team Converting Holders. If, after the Reorganization Effective Time, Team Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the appropriate Reorganization Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 1.05_. 

   

 (d) _Treatment of Converted Team Common Shares in the Recapitalization Merger_. The Company Common Units issuable to the Team Converting Holders upon conversion of their respective Team Common Shares in the Reorganization Merger shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding and held by the Team Converting Holders as of the Recapitalization Effective Time, whether or not the exchange procedures set forth in this _Section 1.05_ have been completed with respect to such shares; _provided_ that in order to actually receive the portion of the Recapitalization Merger Consideration to which any such holder is otherwise entitled, such holder must first comply with the exchange procedures provided in this _Section 1.05_. 

   

 (e) _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Reorganization Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Team shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or 

    ##### 

  

    

combination, exchange or readjustment of Team Common Shares, or stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Reorganization
Merger Consideration, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted; _provided_ that no such adjustment
shall be made as a result of the exercise during such period of Team Options
outstanding on the date hereof. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. The Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article 1_ such amounts as it is required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the Company so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Team Common Shares in respect of which the Company made such deduction or withholding. 

   

 SECTION 1.06. Options. Team shall cause all outstanding options, warrants and rights to acquire Team Common Shares to be canceled, as of the Reorganization Effective Time, and, (x) in exchange for such cancellation, each holder of a Team Option (a " _Team Option Holder_ ") shall be entitled to a right to receive, at the Recapitalization Effective Time, the product of (i) the excess, if any, of $59.01333 (the " _Per Team Option Merger Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 2.06_, over the applicable exercise price per share of such Team Option multiplied by (ii) the number of Team Common Shares such holder could have purchased if such holder had exercised such Team Option in full immediately prior to such time and (y) all other Options shall be cancelled without creating or incurring any liability or obligation on the part of Team or any of its Affiliates. The consideration provided for in this _Section 1.06_ is collectively referred to herein as the " _Team Option Merger Consideration_." Each of the Surviving Corporation and the Company, in its capacity as exchange agent, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Team Option Merger Consideration otherwise payable hereunder to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Federal, state, local or foreign income Tax Law. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation or the Company, in its capacity as exchange agent, so withholds those amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Team Option Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The Company and Team shall take all action reasonably necessary (including the adoption of any necessary resolutions, plan amendments and/or the obtaining of any necessary consents) in order to effect the foregoing and to ensure that, as of the Reorganization Effective Time, all Options terminate or otherwise cease to be outstanding. 

   

ARTICLE 2 
 THE RECAPITALIZATION MERGER 

   

 SECTION 2.01. The Recapitalization Merger. 

   

 (a) At the Recapitalization Effective Time, PurchaserSub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the LLC Act (the " _Recapitalization Merger_ "), at which time the separate existence of PurchaserSub shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence. In its capacity as the limited liability company surviving the Recapitalization Merger, the Company is sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Company_." 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereby, waiver of all conditions to the Recapitalization Merger set forth herein, the Company and PurchaserSub shall cause to be executed, acknowledged and filed a certificate of merger, substantially in the form of  _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the " _Recapitalization Certificate of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary_ ") and make all other filings or recordings required by Section 18-209 of the LLC Act in connection with the Recapitalization Merger; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the parties hereto shall be obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the date specified for Closing in _Section 2.01(d)_.

    ##### 

  

     

 (a) Each membership interest in PurchaserSub outstanding immediately prior to the Recapitalization Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Class A Common Unit of the Surviving Company. 

   

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in _Sections 2.04(c), (d) or (e)_, each Company Common Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Recapitalization Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $59.01333 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Unit Merger Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.06. Such cash consideration to be received in respect of the Company Common Units is referred to herein as the " _Recapitalization Merger Consideration_." All such Company Common Units, when so converted pursuant to this _Section 2.04(b)_, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist. Each holder of Company Common Units so converted shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, without interest, the applicable Recapitalization Merger Consideration.

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that, after the date hereof and prior to the Reorganization Effective Time, _Schedule 2.04(c)_ (i) may be supplemented and/or amended in a writing, signed by each of the parties hereto, to designate additional Company Common Units as Retained Units and to identify the owners of such Retained Units, and (ii) will be deemed to be automatically updated to reflect any transfer of ownership of any Retained Units permitted hereunder. 

   

 (d) Each Company Common Unit held by the Company in treasury or owned by Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary immediately prior to the Recapitalization Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

   

 (e) Each Company Common Unit owned by any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Recapitalization Effective Time shall automatically be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Class A Common Unit of the Surviving Company.

The Surviving Company shall act as paying agent for the purpose of effectuating the exchange of the Recapitalization Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article 2_ for Company Common Units that were outstanding immediately prior to the Recapitalization Effective Time, which were converted into the right to receive the Recapitalization Merger Consideration or the Exchange Units, as the case may be. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Subject to _Section 1.05(d)_ and to this _Section 2.05_ , at and following the Recapitalization Effective Time: 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) Purchaser shall make all of the Recapitalization Merger Consideration available to each Person that is entitled to receive the Recapitalization Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.04(b)_ above (each a " _Company Holder_ ") for exchange in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 1.05(d)_, at and following the Recapitalization Effective Time, upon surrender to Purchaser by a Company Holder of a duly executed and completed Transmittal Letter and such other documentation evidencing such holders ownership of such holders Company Common Units (other than any Retained Units) as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser, such holder shall immediately be paid in cash, by wire transfer to the account(s) specified in such holders Transmittal Letter, in exchange therefor the amount of the Recapitalization Merger Consideration (less any required withholding Taxes) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article 2_ in respect of such Company Common Units. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.05_, each holder of Company Common Units (other than the Retained Units) shall be deemed upon and at any time after the Recapitalization Effective Time to have only the right to receive the appropriate amount of the Recapitalization Merger Consideration without interest as provided in this _Article 2_. If any portion of the Recapitalization Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Common Units are registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Company Common Units so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to Purchaser, on behalf of the Surviving Company, any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Common Units or establish to the satisfaction of Purchaser that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (ii) The Company shall make the Exchange Units available to the holders of Retained Units for exchange in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 1.05(d)_ , at the Recapitalization Effective Time, upon surrender to the Company by a holder of Retained Units of a duly executed and completed Transmittal Letter and such other documentation evidencing such holders ownership of such holders Retained Units as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser, such holder of such Retained Units shall be entitled to immediately receive in exchange therefor the aggregate number of Exchange Units (less any required withholding Taxes) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article 2_ in respect of the Retained Units held by such holder. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.05_, each holder of Retained Units shall be deemed upon and at any time after the Recapitalization Effective Time to have only the right to receive the appropriate aggregate number of Exchange Units without interest as provided in this _Article 2_. If any Exchange Units are to be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Retained Units are registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Retained Units so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Company, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Retained Units or establish to the satisfaction of the Company that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Units_. All Recapitalization Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of Company Common Units in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Units. As of the Recapitalization Effective Time, the unit transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration 

    ##### 

  

    

of transfers on the Companys unit transfer books of the Company Common Units
formerly owned by the Company Holders other than the Retained Units converted
pursuant to _Section 2.04(c)_. 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Recapitalization Effective Time, any change in the outstanding units or other equity interests of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, unit split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Company Common Units, or equity dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Recapitalization Merger Consideration, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted. 

   

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article 2_ such amounts as it is required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. If Purchaser so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Units in respect of which Purchaser made such deduction or withholding. 

   

 SECTION 2.06. Adjustment of the Per Team Option Merger Consideration and the Per Unit Merger Consideration. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser an itemized statement, substantially in the form of _Schedule 3.18_, representing the Companys good faith estimate, as of the Recapitalization Merger Effective Time, of all Transaction Expenses (the " _Expense Statement_ "), together with invoices or other reasonable supporting documentation for such expenses. In the event that Purchaser objects that a material item has been omitted from such statement, the Company and Purchaser hereby agree to reasonably cooperate and to negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objection prior to the Business Day before Closing, and the Expense Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect such resolution. If the amount of the Transaction Expenses as set forth on the Expense Statement (as revised in accordance with the preceding sentence) exceeds $12 million, then the Per Team Option Merger Consideration and the Per Unit Merger Consideration, and hence the amount of the Team Option Merger Consideration and the Recapitalization Merger Consideration that each holder of Team Options and/or Company Common Units shall be entitled to receive under  _Sections 1.06_ and _2.04_ , shall each be reduced by an amount equal to (i) the amount by which the Transaction Expenses exceeds $12 million divided by (ii) 10,794,172.

 SECTION 4.07. Acquisition of Common Units for Investment.

Person is able to pay all liabilities of such Person as such liabilities
mature; and (iii) such Person does not have unreasonably small capital for
conducting the business theretofore or proposed to be conducted by such
Person.
