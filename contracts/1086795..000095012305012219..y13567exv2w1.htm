</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the stockholders of PurchaserSub seek to acquire a controlling interest in the
Company through a transaction intended by Purchaser to be accounted for as a recapitalization;
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in connection with such recapitalization, it is also necessary to effect a
reorganization of Team in which Team MergerSub will merge with and into Team, with (a)&nbsp;the Team
Common Shares held by stockholders of Team, other than the Company, being converted into Company
Common Units, (b)&nbsp;the Team Common Shares held by the Company being cancelled and (c)&nbsp;the shares of
common stock of Team MergerSub being converted into shares of common stock of the surviving
corporation of the merger, such that Team will become a direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of Team
Finance and an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the TBCA;
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the recapitalization will involve a merger, to be consummated immediately after the
Reorganization Merger, in which PurchaserSub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
Common Units (subject to certain exceptions described in this Agreement) being converted into the
right to receive cash and the shares of PurchaserSub being converted into common units of the
Surviving Company, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the
LLC Act;

of directors of Team and the managers of Purchaser and PurchaserSub have each approved and adopted
this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the acquisition of the Company and, thereby, the
acquisition of Team by Purchaser to be effected by the foregoing mergers;
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Team Finance, as the sole stockholder of Team MergerSub, has duly approved and

accordance with the TBCA;

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as an inducement for the Company, Team, Team Finance and Team MergerSub to enter into
this Agreement, Blackstone Capital Partners IV L.P., currently the sole member of Purchaser, has,
on the date hereof, executed and delivered to the Company a limited guaranty (the

agree as follows:

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;At the Reorganization Effective Time, Team MergerSub shall be merged with and into Team in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TBCA (the &#147;<U>Reorganization
Merger</U>&#148;), at which time the separate existence of Team MergerSub shall cease and Team shall
continue its existence. In its capacity as the corporation surviving the Reorganization Merger,
Team is sometimes referred to as the &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>.&#148;
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereby, waiver of
all conditions to the Recapitalization Merger set forth herein (other than the occurrence of the
Reorganization Merger), Team and Team MergerSub shall cause articles of merger, substantially in
the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> hereto (the &#147;<U>Reorganization Certificate of Merger</U>&#148;), to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee (the
&#147;<U>Tennessee Secretary</U>&#148;) and make all other filings or recordings required by the TBCA in
connection with the Reorganization Merger. The &#147;<U>Reorganization Effective Time</U>&#148; shall be the
date and time that the Reorganization Certificate of Merger is filed with the Tennessee Secretary
(unless a later date and/or time is otherwise agreed upon by the parties and specified in an
amendment to this Agreement, in which case, the Reorganization Effective Time shall be the date and
time so specified).
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;From and after the Reorganization Effective Time, the Reorganization Merger shall have the

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;The closing of the Reorganization Merger shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher &#038;
