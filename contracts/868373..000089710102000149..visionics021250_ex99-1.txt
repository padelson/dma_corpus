ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SHARES   2.1 CONVERSION OF STOCK. Pursuant to
the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holders of any
outstanding shares of capital stock or securities of Visionics or Merger
Sub:   (a) As of the Effective Time, each share of Visionics Common Stock,
together with the rights (the "VISIONICS RIGHTS"), if any, associated with
each such share issued in connection with the Visionics Rights Agreement (the
"VISIONICS RIGHTS PLAN") dated May 2, 1996 between Visionics and Wells Fargo
Bank, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other

Section 2.1(c)), shall be automatically converted into 1.3436 (the "EXCHANGE
RATIO") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Identix Common Stock.   (b)
As of the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Visionics Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive (i) a certificate (or direct registration)
representing the number of whole shares of Identix Common Stock into which
such shares have been converted (the "IDENTIX CERTIFICATES"), and (ii) cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Identix Common Stock in accordance with

of Visionics Common Stock held of record immediately prior to the Effective
Time by Visionics, Merger Sub, Identix or any Subsidiary (as defined in

STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.01 par value,

ownership of the same number of shares of Common Stock, $0.01, of the
Surviving Corporation.    99.1-3     (e) Without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend

occurring or having a record date or an effective date on or after the date

Identix Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger. Instead, each
holder of shares of Visionics Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
a fraction of a share of Identix Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Identix Common Stock to be received by such holder)
shall receive from Identix an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
Identix Closing Value. For the purposes of this Agreement, "IDENTIX CLOSING

reported on the Nasdaq National Market ("NASDAQ") on the trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time.   (g) For the purposes of this
Agreement, the "EXCHANGE MULTIPLE" of any quantity means the product obtained
from multiplying such quantity by the Exchange Ratio, and the "EXCHANGE
QUOTIENT" of any quantity means the quotient obtained from dividing such

(through ownership of securities, by contract or otherwise) or (B) such
Person or any Subsidiary of such Person is a general partner of any general
partnership or a manager of any limited liability company. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term "PERSON" means any individual, group,
organization, corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust or entity of any kind.   2.2 VISIONICS OPTIONS, VISIONICS
WARRANTS   (a) As of the Effective Time, Identix shall, to the full extent
permitted by applicable law, assume all of the stock options of
Visionics outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
Visionics Stock Plans (as defined below) (the "VISIONICS OPTIONS"). For
purposes of this Agreement, "VISIONICS STOCK PLANS" means Visionics\' Stock
Incentive Plan, 1990 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and 1998 Stock Option
Plan. Each Visionics Option, whether or not exercisable at the Effective
Time, shall, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, be assumed by
Identix in such a manner that it shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as under the Visionics Stock Plan pursuant to which it was granted
and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder; provided that (i) each
such option thereafter shall be exercisable for a number of shares of Identix
Common Stock (rounded down to    99.1-4    the nearest whole share)
equal to the Exchange Multiple of the number of shares of Visionics Common
Stock subject to such option, and (ii) the option price per share of Identix
Common Stock thereafter shall equal the Exchange Quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) of the option price per share of Visionics Common Stock
subject to such option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"IDENTIX EXCHANGE OPTIONS"). With respect to shares of Visionics Common Stock
issued pursuant to the Visionics 1992 Restricted Stock Plan ("VISIONICS
RESTRICTED STOCK"), all such Visionics Restricted Stock, which shall
automatically be converted into shares of Identix Common Stock as provided in
Section 2.1, shall continue to be subject to such restrictions and rights
of repurchase as are provided for in the 1992 Restricted Stock Plan. Prior to
the Effective Time, Visionics shall make all adjustments provided for in
the Visionics Stock Plans with respect to the Visionics Options to facilitate
the implementation of the provisions of this Section 2.2(a).   (b) As of
the Effective Time, Identix shall, to the full extent permitted by applicable
law, assume all of the warrants of Visionics identified on Schedule 3.6(e) of
the Identix Disclosure Statement and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "VISIONICS WARRANTS") under the agreements pursuant to
which the Visionics Warrants were issued (the "VISIONICS WARRANT
AGREEMENTS"). Each Visionics Warrant shall, to the full extent permitted by
applicable law, be assumed by Identix in such a manner that it shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the Visionics Warrant
Agreement pursuant to which it was granted; provided that (i) each such
warrant thereafter shall be exercisable for a number of shares of Identix
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the Exchange
Multiple of the number of shares of Visionics Common Stock subject to such
warrant, and (ii) the warrant exercise price per share of Identix
Common Stock thereafter shall equal the Exchange Quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) of the warrant exercise price per share of Visionics
Common Stock subject to such warrant in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "IDENTIX EXCHANGE WARRANTS"). Prior to the Effective
Time, Visionics shall make all adjustments provided for in the Visionics
Warrant Agreements with respect to the Visionics Warrants to facilitate the
implementation of the provisions of this Section 2.2(b).   2.3 EXCHANGE OF
STOCK CERTIFICATES.   (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Identix shall
enter into an agreement with a bank or trust company selected by Identix
and reasonably acceptable to Visionics to act as the exchange agent for the
Merger (the "EXCHANGE AGENT").   (b) At or prior to the Effective Time,
Identix shall supply or cause to be supplied to or for the account of the
Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of Visionics Common
Stock, for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.3 (i) certificates (or direct
registration) evidencing the shares of Identix Common Stock issuable pursuant
to Section 2.1 to be exchanged for outstanding shares of Visionics Common
Stock, and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to make the payments
in lieu of fractional shares provided for in Section 2.1(f).   
99.1-5     (c) Promptly after the Effective Time, Identix shall mail
or shall cause to be mailed to each Holder (as defined below) a letter
of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Visionics Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Visionics Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for surrender of the Visionics Certificates. Upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Visionics Certificate, together with
such letter of transmittal duly executed, the Holder shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor: (i) certificates evidencing that number of
shares of Identix Common Stock issuable to such Holder in accordance with
this Article II; (ii) any dividends or other distributions that such Holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.3(d); and (iii) cash in
respect of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.1(f), and such
Visionics Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
certificate representing shares of Identix Common Stock will be issued to a
Person who is not the registered owner of a surrendered Visionics Certificate
unless (i) the Visionics Certificate so surrendered has been properly
endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer, and (ii) such Person
shall either (A) pay any transfer or other tax required by reason of such
issuance or (B) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3, from and
after the Effective Time, each Visionics Certificate shall be deemed to
represent, for all purposes other than payment of dividends, the right to
receive a certificate representing the number of full shares of
Identix Common Stock as determined in accordance with this Article II and
cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.1(f). For purposes
of this Agreement, "VISIONICS CERTIFICATE" means a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Visionics
Common Stock, and "HOLDER" means a person who holds one or more Visionics
Certificates as of the Effective Time.   (d) No dividend or other
distribution declared with respect to Identix Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to Holders of unsurrendered Visionics
Certificates until such Holders surrender their Visionics Certificates. Upon
the surrender of such Visionics Certificates, there shall be paid to such
Holders, promptly after such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, excluding interest, declared with a record date after the
Effective Time and not paid because of the failure to surrender Visionics
Certificates for exchange.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither the Exchange Agent, Identix, the Surviving
Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Visionics Common Stock for shares of Identix Common Stock or cash in lieu of
fractional shares delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.    99.1-6     2.4 LOST,
STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event that any Visionics
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue and pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Visionics Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of Identix Common Stock
as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(f) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d); provided,
however, that Identix may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Visionics Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Identix or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Visionics Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.   2.5 TAX CONSEQUENCES. For United States
federal income tax purposes, it is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code and that this Agreement constitutes a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF VISIONICS

is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be
so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power, authority
or qualification would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Visionics Material Adverse Effect. Each of Visionics and the Visionics
Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign Person to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or
leased properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing

"VISIONICS MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means any state of facts, change, event
or effect that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, financial condition, results of
operations or assets and liabilities, taken as a whole, of Visionics,
including the Visionics Subsidiaries, (ii) the ability of Visionics to
consummate the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement or to perform any of its obligations under the Agreement before the
Effective Time, or (iii) Identix\' ability to vote, receive dividends

stock of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to item (i) above, none of the following shall be deemed (either
alone or in combination) to constitute, and none of the following shall be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a
Visionics Material Adverse Effect: (A) any adverse change, event or effect
arising from or relating to general business or economic conditions; (B) any

Visionics Subsidiaries.   3.2 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT.
Visionics has full corporate power and authority to (i) execute and deliver
this Agreement, and (ii) assuming the approval of the Merger by a majority of
the outstanding shares of Visionics Common Stock at the Visionics Special
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in accordance with
Delaware Law, consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly and
validly authorized by the vote of the board of directors of Visionics, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Visionics are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
approval of the adoption of the Agreement and approval of the Merger by a
majority of the outstanding shares of Visionics Common Stock at the Visionics
Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in accordance with
Delaware Law). The Agreement has been duly and validly executed   
99.1-8    and delivered by Visionics and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Identix and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of Visionics, enforceable against Visionics in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally or by general
equitable principles.   3.3 NO VIOLATIONS, ETC. No filing with or
notification to, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
court, administrative agency, commission, or other governmental or regulatory
body, authority or instrumentality ("GOVERNMENT ENTITY") is necessary on the
part of Visionics for the consummation by Visionics of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, or for the exercise by Identix and
the Surviving Corporation of full rights to own and operate the business of
Visionics and the Visionics Subsidiaries as presently being conducted, except

Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR ACT"), and (iv) where the failure to make
such filing or notification or to obtain such permit, authorization, consent
or approval would not prevent or materially delay the Merger, or otherwise
prevent or materially delay Visionics from performing its obligations under
this Agreement or individually or in the aggregate, have a Visionics Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the execution and delivery of the Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
nor compliance by Visionics with all of the provisions hereof and thereof,
nor the exercise by Identix and the Surviving Corporation of full rights to
own and operate the business of Visionics and the Visionics Subsidiaries as
presently being conducted will, subject to obtaining the approval of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Visionics
Common Stock at the Visionics Special Meeting or any adjournment thereof in
accordance with Delaware Law, (i) conflict with or result in any breach of
any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter
document of Visionics or any Visionics Subsidiary, (ii) violate any material
order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to
Visionics or any Visionics Subsidiary, or by which any of their properties or
assets may be bound, or (iii) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default under, or result in any material change in, or give rise to any right
of termination, cancellation, acceleration, redemption or repurchase under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, contract, agreement or
other instrument or obligation to which Visionics or any Visionics Subsidiary
is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may
be bound. Schedule 3.3 of the Visionics Disclosure Statement lists all
consents, waivers and approvals required to be obtained in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under any of
Visionics\' or any Visionics Subsidiaries\' notes, bonds, mortgages,
indentures, deeds of trust, licenses or leases, contracts, agreements or
other instruments or obligations the failure to obtain which would have a
Visionics Material Adverse Effect.    99.1-9     3.4 BOARD

obligating Visionics to grant, issue, extend, accelerate the vesting of, or
enter into, any such warrant, option, convertible security, call, right,
stock appreciation right, preemptive right, right of first refusal, agreement
or commitment. To the knowledge of Visionics, except for the Visionics Voting

as provided in Section 2.2(b).   3.7 SEC FILINGS. Visionics has filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") all required forms,
reports, registration statements and documents required to be filed by it
with the SEC (collectively, all such forms, reports, registration statements
and documents filed since January 1, 1999 are referred to herein as the
"VISIONICS SEC REPORTS"). All of the Visionics SEC Reports complied as to

available to Identix. As of their respective dates, the Visionics SEC Reports
(including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Visionics has been advised by each of its
officers and directors that each such person and such persons\' affiliates
have complied with all filing requirements under Section 13 and Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act.   3.8 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Neither Visionics nor any

export or import of goods or technology) of any foreign, federal, state or
local    99.1-11    government or any other governmental department or
agency, except where any such violations or failures to comply would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Visionics Material Adverse Effect.
Visionics and the Visionics Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses and

owned or leased properties or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in

of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or to perform any of its
obligations under the Agreement before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding

or will be, an Identix Material Adverse Effect: (A) any adverse change, event
or effect arising from or relating to general business or economic
conditions; (B) any adverse change, event or effect relating to or affecting

conditions or provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture,

to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible under Section 280G
or 162(m) of the Code (or any comparable provision of state or local
law).   (g) Identix and each of the Identix Subsidiaries have
properly withheld on all amounts paid to consultants or employees, or to

Subsidiaries, and each of the Identix Employee Benefit Plans, are in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other

or in the aggregate, have an Identix Material Adverse Effect.   (c) All
contributions to, and payments from, the Pension Plans which are required to
have been made in accordance with the Pension Plans have been timely made,

have an Identix Material Adverse Effect.   (d) To the knowledge of Identix,
all of Identix\' Pension Plans and Identix\' Subsidiaries\' Pension Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code so qualify, and no event
has occurred and no condition exists with respect to the form or operation of
such Pension Plans which would cause the loss of such qualification or the
imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code,
except for such operational failures as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have an Identix Material Adverse Effect.   (e) To the knowledge
of Identix, there are no (i) investigations pending by any governmental

fiduciary of any Identix Employee Benefit Plans with respect to the operation
of such plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Identix
Employee Benefit Plans or against the assets of any trust under such plan,
except for those which would not, individually or in the aggregate, give rise
to any liability which would have an Identix Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of Identix, there are no facts which would give rise to
any liability under this Section 4.19(e) except for those which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an
Identix Material Adverse Effect in the event of any such investigation,
claim, suit or proceeding.   (f) None of Identix, any of the Identix
Subsidiaries or any employee of the foregoing, nor any trustee,
administrator, other fiduciary or any other "party in interest" or

an Identix Material Adverse Effect.   (g) None of Identix, any of the
Identix Subsidiaries, nor any of their Identix ERISA Affiliates maintain or

of ERISA.    99.1-39     (h) Neither Identix nor any Subsidiary of
Identix nor any Identix ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability
under Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.   (i) Neither

continuing benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant following termination of employment, except as may be required
under COBRA, or except at the expense of the participant or the
participant\'s beneficiary. Identix and each of the Identix Subsidiaries
which maintain a "group health plan" within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1)
of the Code have complied with the notice and continuation requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and the regulations thereunder except where the failure to comply would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Identix
Material Adverse Effect.   (l) No liability under any Pension Benefit Plan
or Welfare Plan has been funded nor has any such obligation been satisfied
with the purchase of a contract from an insurance company as to which Identix
or any of the Identix Subsidiaries has received notice that such insurance
company is in rehabilitation or a comparable proceeding.   (m) The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in an increase in the amount of compensation or benefits or accelerate

or in respect of any employee of Identix or any of the Identix
Subsidiaries.   Schedule 4.19(n) of the Identix Disclosure Statement lists

provided thereunder are not mandated by the laws of the applicable foreign
jurisdiction.    99.1-40     4.20 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   (a) To the
knowledge of Identix, except for such cases that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not and would not reasonably be expected to have an Identix
Material Adverse Effect, no underground storage tanks and no amount of any
Hazardous Materials are present, as a result of the actions of Identix or any
of the Identix Subsidiaries or, to Identix\' knowledge, as a result of any

board determines in good faith (x) after consultation with its financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably likely to result
in an Identix Superior Offer (as hereafter defined), and (y) based upon

board of directors of Visionics from withholding, withdrawing, amending or
modifying its recommendation in favor of the Merger if (i) a Visionics
Superior Offer is made to Visionics and is not withdrawn, (ii) Visionics
shall have provided written notice to Identix (a "VISIONICS NOTICE OF
SUPERIOR OFFER") advising Identix that Visionics has received a Visionics
Superior Offer, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Visionics Superior Offer and identifying the person or entity making such
Superior Offer, (iii) Identix shall not have, within three (3) business days
of Identix\' receipt of the Visionics Notice of Superior Offer, made an offer
that Visionics board of directors by a majority vote determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor) to be at least
as favorable to Visionics\' stockholders as such Visionics Superior Offer (it

capital stock of Visionics, on terms that the board of directors of Visionics
determines, in its reasonable judgment (after consultation with its financial
advisor) to be more favorable to its stockholders than the terms of the
Merger; provided, however, that any such offer shall not be deemed to be
a "Visionics Superior Offer" if any financing required to consummate
the transaction contemplated by such offer is not committed and is not likely
in the reasonable judgment of Visionics\' board of directors (after
consultation with its financial advisor) to be obtained by such third party
on a timely basis.   (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the board
of directors of Identix from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying

made to Identix and is not withdrawn, (ii) Identix shall have provided
written notice to Visionics (an "IDENTIX NOTICE OF SUPERIOR OFFER") advising

written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following
transactions: (i) a merger or consolidation involving Identix pursuant to
which the stockholders of Identix immediately preceding such transaction hold
less than a majority of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction or (ii) the acquisition by any person or group
(including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or a two
step transaction involving a tender offer followed with reasonable promptness
by a merger involving Identix), directly or indirectly, of ownership of 51%
of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Identix, on terms that the
board of directors of Identix determines, in its reasonable judgment (after
consultation with of its financial advisor) to be more favorable to its
stockholders than the terms of the Merger; provided, however, that any such
offer shall not be deemed to be a "Identix Superior Offer" if any financing
required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is not
committed and is not likely in the reasonable judgment of Identix\' board of
directors (after consultation with its financial advisor) to be obtained by
such third party on a timely basis.   (g) Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit Visionics or Identix or its respective board of
directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange

the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
practicable. Identix shall also take any action required to be taken under
applicable state blue sky or securities laws in connection with Identix
Common Stock to be issued in exchange for the shares of Visionics Common
Stock. Identix and Visionics shall promptly furnish to each other all
information, and take such other actions (including without limitation using
all commercially reasonable efforts to provide any required consents of their
respective independent auditors), as may reasonably be requested in
connection with any action by any of them in connection with the   
99.1-51    preceding sentences of this Section 5.4(h). Whenever any party
learns of the occurrence of any event which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
Registration Statement or any other filing made pursuant to this Section
5.4(h), Identix or Visionics, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the
other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff
and/or mailing to stockholders of Visionics such amendment or supplement.  
5.5 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, Identix, Merger Sub and Visionics shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
