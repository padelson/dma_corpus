an agreement with  the Company's transfer agent or another paying agent
selected by Parent and  reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying 
Agent_ "),  and  Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited, by wire
transfer of immediately  available funds, in trust with the Paying Agent for
the benefit of the holders  of Company Common Stock, Company Options and/or
Company Warrants cash in an  aggregate amount equal to the sum of (i) the
product of the Merger Consideration  and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time and
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration  ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration allocable to the
Dissenting  Shares shall not be required to be deposited with the Paying
Agent),  _plus_   (ii) the  aggregate Option Settlement Payments _plus_  
(iii)  the aggregate Warrant Settlement Payments (collectively, the "
_Payment  Fund_ ").  The  Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund in the
manner specified by Parent,  and interest or other income resulting from the
investment of the Payment Fund  shall be solely for the account of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation. No  such  investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to the Company's  stockholders hereunder. All costs and
expenses related to the Paying Agent,  the  Payment Fund, the agreement with
the Paying Agent and the investments made  by  the Paying Agent shall be
paid one-half by the Company and one-half by Parent  (or, if after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) Promptly  after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause  the  Paying Agent to deliver to each holder of record of (A) a
certificate or  certificates which represented shares of Company Common Stock
(other than  treasury shares or shares held by any Company Entity or Parent
Entity)  immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Certificates_ ")  or (B)  shares of Company Common Stock represented
immediately prior to the Effective  Time by book-entry (" _Book-Entry 
Shares_ "),  appropriate transmittal materials and instructions
(collectively, the " _Letter  of Transmittal_ ")  (which  shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to  such
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates  to 
the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the 
procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal). The Certificates of
Company  Common Stock so delivered shall be duly endorsed as the Paying Agent
may  require. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common  Stock represented by Certificates that is not registered in the
transfer records  of the Company, the consideration provided in _Section 
3.1_   may be  issued to a transferee if the Certificates representing such
shares are  delivered to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence  such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the
Paying Agent that any  applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any
Certificate shall have  been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt
of (x) an affidavit  of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate
to be lost, mislaid,  stolen or destroyed, (y) such bond, security or
indemnity as Parent and the  Paying Agent may reasonably require and (z) any
other documents necessary  to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange
thereof, the Paying Agent shall  issue to such holder the consideration into
which the shares represented by  such  lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed
Certificate shall have been converted. 

 

 

(ii) Promptly  after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the  Paying Agent to deliver (A) to each holder of Company
Options (other than  Company Options issued and outstanding under the ESPP),
an Option Surrender  Agreement, instructions for effecting the surrender of
such Company Options  in  exchange for the Option Settlement Payment and (B)
to each holder of Company  Warrants, a Warrant Surrender Agreement,
instructions for effecting the  surrender of such Company Warrants in
exchange for the Warrant Settlement  Payment.

The  Paying Agent may establish such other reasonable and customary rules
and  procedures to effect an orderly exchange. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay  all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection  with the distribution of the consideration provided in _Article 
III_.

 

 

(b) After  the  Effective Time:

 

 

(i) Each  holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
canceled  pursuant to _Section  3.2_   or as to  which statutory appraisal
rights have been perfected as provided in _Section  3.3_ )  issued  and
outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender their Certificate(s)  or 
Book-Entry Shares (in accordance with the terms of the Letter of
Transmittal)  to  the Paying Agent and shall promptly upon surrender
thereof, together with a  properly completed Letter of Transmittal, receive
in exchange therefor the  Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock  represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share. The Paying Agent shall  not  be obligated to deliver the Merger
Consideration to which any former holder  of  Company Common Stock is
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder  surrenders such
holder's Certificates (or the documents required by _Section  4.1(a)_   for
a  lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate) or Book-Entry Shares (in 
accordance with the terms of the Letter of Transmittal) for exchange as
provided  in this _Section  4.1_.

 

 

(ii) Upon  surrender of a Company Option (other than Company Options issued
and outstanding  under the ESPP) for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with the Option  Surrender Agreement, duly executed, and any other
documents reasonably required  by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Company Option shall be entitled to  receive in exchange therefor the Option
Settlement Payment, and the Company  Option so surrendered shall then be
canceled. Until surrendered in accordance  with the provisions of this
_Section  4.1_ ,  each  Company Option shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent  for all purposes only the right to receive
the Option Settlement Payment as  contemplated by this _Article  IV_.

 

 

(iii) Upon  surrender of a Company Warrant for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together  with the Warrant Surrender Agreement, duly executed, and any
other documents  reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of the
Company Warrant  shall  be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Warrant Settlement Payment,  and  the Company Warrant so surrendered shall
then be canceled. Until surrendered  in  accordance with the provisions of
this _Section  4.1_ ,  each  Company Warrant shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to  represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the Warrant Settlement  Payment as contemplated by this _Article 
IV_.

 

 

(c) Each  of  Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to  deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to the holders  of  Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company
Warrants, as the case may  be,  pursuant to this Agreement such amounts, if
any, as it is required to deduct  and  withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue  Code or any applicable provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the  extent that any amounts are so
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation  or  the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated  for  all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares  of  Company
Common Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants, as the case may  be,  in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the 
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

(d) Any  portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest thereon) made
available  to  the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section  4.1(a)_   that 
remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company 
Options or Company Warrants, as the case may be, six months after the
Effective  Time shall be returned to Parent by the Paying Agent, and any such
holder who  has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration,  Company Options for the Option Settlement Payment or Company
Warrants for the  Warrant Settlement Payment, as the case may be, in
accordance with this  _Section  4.1_   prior to  that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation  for  payment of
the Merger Consideration (without any interest thereon) upon due  surrender
of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in  respect of
such shares or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence  to  the
procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, the Option Settlement 
Payment (without any interest thereon) upon delivery to Parent of the Option 
Surrender Agreement, duly executed, in respect of such Company Options or
the  Warrant Settlement Payment (without interest thereon) upon delivery to
Parent  of  the Warrant Settlement Payment, in respect of the such Company
Warrants, as  the  case may be. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, none of  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to a  holder of Company Common Stock, Company Options
or Company Warrants for any  amounts paid or property delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant  to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. Any amounts  remaining unclaimed by any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company  Options or Company Warrants two years after
the Effective Time (or such earlier  date, immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat  to, or become property of any
federal, state of local government authority)  shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent  free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled  thereto.

At  the  Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed as  to  holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and  no  transfer of Company Common Stock by any such holder
shall thereafter be made  or  recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in
accordance with the provisions  of  _Section  4.1_ ,  each  Certificate
theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock (other  than  shares
to be canceled pursuant to _Sections  3.2_   or as to  which statutory
appraisal rights have been perfected as provided in _Section  3.3_ )  and 
each Book-Entry Share shall from and after the Effective Time represent for 
all  purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
exchange  therefor, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any  dividends or make any other distributions with a
record date prior to the  Effective Time which have been declared or made by
the Company in respect of  such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this  Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time.

(other than to another Company Entity) additional shares of its capital
stock  (or other equity interests) or Equity Rights or by which any Company
Entity  is  or may be bound to transfer any shares of the capital stock (or

validly existing and in good standing under the  Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is incorporated or organized, and has  the  corporate power and
authority necessary for it to own, lease and operate its  Assets and to carry
on its business as now conducted, except where the failure  of which would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is duly  qualified
or licensed to transact business as a foreign entity in good standing  in the
States of the United States and foreign jurisdictions where the character  of
its Assets or the nature or conduct of its business requires it to be so 
qualified or licensed, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to 
be  so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually  or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made  available to Parent true and complete copies of the

this calendar year or any of the preceding three calendar years, (iii) any

(c) Each  Company Benefit Plan is in compliance with the terms of such
Company Benefit  Plan and the Internal Revenue Code, ERISA and all other
applicable Laws in  all  material respects. Each Company Benefit Plan that
is intended to be qualified  under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code has received a favorable  determination letter from the IRS that is
still in effect. To the Knowledge  of  the Company, nothing has occurred
since the date of the applicable determination  letter that could reasonably

any such plan or the exempt status of any applicable  trust. The Company has
not received any communication (written or unwritten)  from any Regulatory
Authority questioning or challenging the compliance of  any  Company Benefit
Plan with applicable Laws. Within the past three calendar years,  no Company

Company who is an administrator  or  fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan
(or, to the Company's Knowledge, any agent  of any of the foregoing) has
engaged in any transaction, or acted or failed  to  act in any manner, which
could subject the Company or Parent to any direct  or  indirect material
Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any  fiduciary, co-
fiduciary or other duty under ERISA. There are no material  unresolved claims
or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the  Company Benefit
Plans other than claims for benefits which are payable in the  ordinary
course of business and no material action, proceeding, prosecution,  inquiry,
hearing or investigation has been commenced with respect to any Company 
Benefit Plan.

 

 

(e) Except  as  disclosed in _Section  5.15(e)_   of the  Company

the Company Benefit Plans are correct and complete in all material  respects,

of the Company Benefit Plans (as required by Law) and there have  been no
material changes in the information set forth therein (in each case,  except
as may be required by Law).

 

 

(f) No  Company Entity has, and, to the Company's Knowledge, no other "party
in  interest" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(14)) or "disqualified person"
(as  defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Company
Benefit  Plan  has, engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
(described in Internal  Revenue Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

 

 

(g) The  Company and its ERISA Affiliates have never sponsored, maintained,
contributed  to, or been obligated under ERISA or otherwise to contribute to
(i) a "defined  benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(35) or Internal
Revenue Code  Section 414(j)), (ii) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
ERISA Sections 3(37)  or 4001(a)(3)) or (iii) a "multiple employer plan"
(meaning a plan sponsored by  more than one employer within the meaning of
ERISA Sections 4063 or 4064 or  Internal Revenue Code Section 413(c)). The
Company and its ERISA Affiliates  have  not incurred and, to the Company's
Knowledge, there are no circumstances under  which any of such Persons could
reasonably incur, any Liability under Title  IV  of ERISA.

 

 

(h) Except  as  disclosed in _Section  5.15(h)_   of the  Company
Disclosure Schedules, no Company Entity has any Liability for retiree  health
or life benefits under any of the Company Benefit Plans except (i) to  the 
extent required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Internal Revenue Code 
Section 4980B or state or local Law or (ii) disability benefits under a
welfare  plan that is fully covered by insurance. All health benefits

(i) Except  as  disclosed in _Section  5.15(i)_   of the  Company
Disclosure Schedules, neither the execution and delivery of this  Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will,  either
alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any person to  any 
benefit under any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise 
payable under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of 
the  time of payment or vesting of any such benefit or (iv) entitle any
individual  to  payments that would constitute "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of  Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

 

 

(j) The  actuarial present values of all accrued deferred compensation
entitlements  (including entitlements under any executive compensation,
supplemental  retirement, or employment agreement) of employees and former
employees of any  Company Entity and their respective beneficiaries have been
fully reflected  in  all material respects on the Company Financial
Statements to the extent required  by, and in accordance with, GAAP.

 

 

(k) All  current employees of each Company Entity that are participating in
(or eligible  to participate in) any Company Benefit Plan are common-law
employees of a  Company Entity. Any individual who performs services for a
Company Entity and  is  not treated as an employee for federal income Tax
purposes by such Company  Entity is not an employee for any purpose including
for Tax withholding or  Company Benefit Plan purposes.

 

 

(l) Each  "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of  the Code) of the Company is in reasonable good faith
compliance with Section  409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the published
applicable guidance  thereunder. Except as expressly set forth on _Section 
5.15(l)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedules, no Company Benefit Plan
that is a nonqualified  deferred compensation plan (but solely to the extent
attributable to deferred  compensation that was earned and vested (within the
meaning of Code Section  409A  and the published applicable guidance
thereunder) as of December 31, 2004)  has  been "materially modified"
(within the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time  after October 3, 2004.

business as now conducted and  to  own, lease and operate its Assets. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub is duly  qualified or licensed to transact business

and foreign jurisdictions where  the  character of its Assets or the nature
or conduct of its business requires it  to  be so qualified or licensed,
except for such jurisdictions in which the failure  to be so qualified or
licensed would not reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The  certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of each of Parent and Merger Sub have  been made
available to the Company for its review and are true and complete  in  all
material respects as in effect as of the date of this Agreement and 
accurately reflect in all material respects all amendments thereto.

transactions contemplated hereby and  thereby, including the Merger, have
been duly and validly authorized by all  necessary corporate action in
respect thereof on the part of Parent and Merger  Sub. This Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents represent a legal,  valid  and binding

Merger Sub in accordance with their respective terms (except as 
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, 
reorganization, moratorium, or other Laws affecting the enforcement of 
creditors' rights generally and except that the availability of the
equitable  remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to
the discretion  of the court before which any proceedings may be brought).

 

 

(b) Neither  the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents  by each of Parent and Merger Sub, nor the consummation
by each of Parent and  Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and

provisions hereof and thereof,  will (i) conflict with or result in a breach
of any provision of Parent's  certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii)
conflict with or result in a breach  of any provision of the articles of
incorporation or bylaws or equivalent  organizational documents of any Parent
Subsidiary (including Merger Sub), or  (iii) constitute or result in a

of any Lien (other than pursuant to  the  credit agreement entered into in
connection with the Debt Financing or  Alternative Financing) on any Asset of
any Parent Entity (with or without notice  or lapse of time, or both) under,
any Contract or Permit of any Parent Entity,  where such Default or Lien, or

than Consents required  from Regulatory Authorities, and other than notices
to or filings with the  IRS  or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
with respect to any employee benefit  plans, or under the HSR Act and any
other applicable foreign pre-merger  notification or competition laws, rules
or regulations, and other than Consents,  filings or notifications which, if
not obtained or made, are not reasonably  likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse  Effect, no notice to, filing with,
or Consent of, any public body or authority  is necessary for the
consummation by Parent of the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated
in this Agreement.

commission or other payment, and Parent has no knowledge  of  any basis for
any claim by any Person for the payment of such fee, commission  or  other
payment.

to the stockholders of the  Company, be false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or omit  to  state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make  the  statements therein, in light of

copy  of the debt commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from
Wells  Fargo Foothill, Inc. (the " _Lender_ ")  to an  Affiliate of Parent
(the " _Debt  Commitment Letter_ ")  pursuant to which the Lender has
committed, upon the terms and subject to the  conditions set forth therein,
to provide credit facilities in the amount  of $55.0 million (including a
$5.0 million revolver) in connection with the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

(b) The  Debt  Commitment Letter, in the form delivered to the Company, is
in full force and  effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent to  the extent of its terms and, to the knowledge of
Parent, the Lender. All  commitment fees required to be paid thereunder have
been and will be duly paid  in full when due. As of the date hereof, there is
no existing default or breach  on the part of Parent, or, to the Parent's
knowledge, the Lender. As of the date  hereof, Parent does not believe that
it will be unable to satisfy in a timely  basis any term or condition of
Closing to be satisfied by it contained in the  Debt Commitment Letter. The
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt  Commitment Letter, if and when
funded immediately prior to the Effective Time  in  accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter, together with the proceeds of the  Equity Financing,
Rollover Contribution or any other exchange similar to the  Rollover
Contribution and available unrestricted cash of the Parent and  Merger Sub,
will be sufficient for Parent and the Merger Sub to pay the  aggregate Merger
Consideration, the aggregate Option Settlement Payment and  the  aggregate
Warrant Settlement Payment, and the fees and expenses incurred in  connection
with  the  transactions contemplated thereby.  The  obligation of the
Lender to fund the commitments under the Debt Commitment  Letter is not
subject to any conditions other than as set forth or referred  to  in the
Debt Commitment Letter.

(b) As  soon  as reasonably practicable (and in any event within one
business day) after  receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

request or inquiry was not  in  writing, a description of the terms of such
proposal, request or inquiry),  and  any written material submitted in

to keep Parent informed in all material  respects of the status and details
(including material amendments or proposed  material amendments) of any such

third party  or  its agents or Representatives in connection with such
proposal, request or  inquiry. The Company shall provide any information to
Parent that it is  providing to any third party pursuant to this _Section

party after the date hereof that  prohibits the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from providing such information  to Parent.

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event that the  Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from  a  third party at any time prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval being obtained  and its Board of Directors (or the
Special Committee) has in good faith  concluded (following the receipt of the
advice of its outside legal counsel  and  its financial advisor), that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably  likely to result in, a Superior
Proposal, it may then take the following  actions: (i) furnish nonpublic
information to the third party making such  Acquisition Proposal, provided
that (A) (1) concurrently with furnishing any  such nonpublic information to
such party, its gives Parent written notice of  its  intention to furnish
nonpublic information and (2) it receives from the third  party an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations  on  the use and
disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished  to such
third party on its behalf, the terms of which are at least as  restrictive as
the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) 
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
third  party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the
extent such  nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished); and
(ii) engage  in  negotiations with the third party with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal,  provided that as soon as reasonably practicable (and
in any event within one  business day) prior to entering into negotiations
with such third party, it  gives Parent written notice of the its intention
to enter into negotiations  with  such third party.

 

 

(d) In  response to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors  of the Company (or the Special Committee) determines in good
faith, after  consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors, constitutes  a Superior Proposal (taking into account any
adjustment to the terms and  conditions of the Merger proposed by Parent in
response to such Acquisition  Proposal), the Board of Directors of the
Company may withhold, withdraw, amend  or modify, or propose or resolve to
withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board  Recommendation, and, in the case
of a Superior Proposal that is a tender or  exchange offer made directly to
its stockholders, may recommend that its  stockholders accept the tender or
exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions,  whether by the Board of
Directors of the Company (or the Special Committee),  a " _Change  of
Recommendation_ "),  if  all of the following conditions are met: (i) a
Superior Proposal with respect  to  it has been made and has not been
withdrawn; (ii) the Company Stockholder  Approval has not been obtained;
(iii) it has determined, after consultation  with  its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary  to comply with the
Board of Directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's  stockholders under
applicable Law; (iv) it shall have (A) provided to  Parent written notice at
least 5 business days prior to taking such action  which  shall state
expressly (1) that it has received a Superior Proposal (and provided  Parent
with the terms and provisions of the Superior Proposal and copies of  such 
agreements and/or documents providing for the Superior Proposal), (2) the 
identity of the Person or Group making the Superior Proposal, and (3) that 
it  intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it
intends  to do so, and (B) made available to Parent all nonpublic information
(to the  extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so
furnished) made  available to the Person or Group making the Superior
Proposal in connection  with  such Superior Proposal; and (v) it shall not
have breached in any material  respect any of the provisions set forth in
_Section  8.1_   or this  _Section  8.2_.

(e) Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company  from taking and disclosing to its stockholders, to
the extent required by  applicable Law, a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated  under the Exchange Act; provided that the
content of any such disclosure  thereunder shall be governed by the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  that in  any such disclosure
document or communication prepared, filed, issued or made  in  conjunction
with the compliance by the Company, the Board of Directors of the  Company or
any committee thereof with such rules or regulations as set forth  in  this
_Section  8.2(e)_ ,  the  Board of Directors of the Company (or any
committee thereof) shall, except  as  expressly permitted by _Section 
8.2(d)_ ,  re-affirm its recommendation to the Company's stockholders to
adopt this  Agreement and approve the Merger (including the Company Board 
Recommendation).

 

 

(f) The  Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, Representatives and
Affiliates  to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing  activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third
party conducted  on or prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or  any  proposal or discussion that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an  Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it
will take the necessary steps  to promptly, and in any event within three
business days after the date hereof,  inform the Persons referred to in the
first sentence of _Section  8.2(a)_   of this  _Section  8.2_.  The 
Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions set 
forth  in this _Section  8.2_   by any  of its Subsidiaries or any
Representatives of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, whether or not
such Person is purporting to act on behalf of  the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed a breach of  this _Section  8.2_
  by the  Company.

(a) To  the  extent required by the HSR Act, each of the Parties will,
within a reasonable  period of time, file with the United States Federal
Trade Commission  (" _FTC_ ")  and  the United States Department of Justice
(" _DOJ_ ")  the  notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated hereby,  will promptly file any supplemental or additional
information which may be  requested in connection therewith pursuant to the
HSR Act, and will comply  in  all material respects with the requirements of
the HSR Act. Each Party shall  use  its reasonable efforts to resolve
objections, if any, which may be asserted  with  respect to the Merger under
the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the  Clayton Act, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and  any  other federal, state or
foreign Law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit,  restrict or regulate
actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or  restraint of trade
(collectively " _Antitrust  Laws_ ").  In  the event any Litigation is
threatened or instituted challenging the Merger  as  violative of Antitrust
Laws, each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to  avoid the filing of, or
resist or resolve, such Litigation. Each Party shall  use  its reasonable
efforts to take such action as may be required by: (i) the  DOJ and/or the
FTC in order to resolve such objections as either of them may  have to the
Merger under the Antitrust Laws; or (ii) any federal or state  court of the
United States, or similar court of competent jurisdiction in any  foreign
jurisdiction, in any suit brought by any Regulatory Authority or any  other
Person challenging the Merger as violative of the Antitrust Laws, in  order 
to avoid the entry of any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent)  which has the effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger
and to have  vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  Party shall be required to sell, or
otherwise dispose, of any businesses or  material Assets or take any action
that would materially and adversely effect  or  otherwise impair such
Party's business or financial condition. Parent shall be  entitled to direct
any proceedings or negotiations with any Regulatory Authority  relating to
any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford the Company  a 
reasonable opportunity to participate therein.

 

 

(b) The  Parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable efforts  to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to effect all  applications, notices, petitions and filings (which shall
include the filings  pursuant to subsection (a) above), and obtain as
promptly as practicable all  Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other
Persons which are necessary  or  advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  (including the Merger). The Parties agree
that they will consult with each  other  with respect to the obtaining of
all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities  and  other Persons necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement and
each Party will keep the other apprised of the status  of  matters relating
to contemplation of the transactions contemplated herein.  Each  Party also
shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication  from  any
Regulatory Authority whose Consent is required for consummation of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such Party to
believe  that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite Consent
will not be  obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be
materially  delayed.

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees
to use, and  to  cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause  to  be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary,  proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective,  as  soon as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using its reasonable  best  efforts to lift or rescind any Order
adversely affecting its ability to  consummate the transactions contemplated
herein and to cause to be satisfied  the  conditions referred to in
_Article  IX_ ;  provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude
either Party from  exercising its rights under this Agreement.

 

 

(b) The  Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken,  or  assist Parent in taking, all action necessary to obtain all
Consents required  for, and to effect all necessary registrations and filings
and submissions  of  information requested or required by any Regulatory
Authority in connection  with, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any novation of the  Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
obligations under any Government  Contract.

 

 

(c) The  Company agrees to provide, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries
and its  and  their respective officers and employees to provide, reasonable
cooperation  as  reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the arrangement  and consummation of, and the negotiation of agreements
with respect to, the  third party debt financing (the " _Debt  Financing_
")  to be  obtained by the Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions  contemplated hereby as described in the Debt Commitment Letter,
or in connection  with any Alternative Financing (defined below).
Notwithstanding anything herein  to the contrary, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be  required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or incur any other liability  in connection with the financings
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter  or  the arrangements therefor
prior to the Effective Time. If Parent has been  notified by any or all of
the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letters  that  funds will not be
available pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters so as to  enable Parent to
proceed with the Closing by the Closing Date for reasons other  than (i) the
occurrence of a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) the actual  or
anticipated failure of the conditions to the Closing set forth in  _Section 
9.1_   to be  satisfied or the actual or anticipated failure by the Company
to satisfy the  conditions to Closing set forth in _Section  9.2_ ,  then 
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative 
debt  financing (" _Alternative  Financing_ ")  from a  Person that is not
an Affiliate of Parent in an amount at least sufficient  to  consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Closing Date;  _provided_
_, _ _however_ ,  that in  no event shall Parent be required to obtain
Alternative Financing on terms  that  are materially less favorable to
Parent or the Company than the terms set forth  in the Debt Commitment
Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a  reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its respective  commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange the Debt Financing or any Alternative 
Financing in accordance with this _Section  8.5_.  Parent  or Merger Sub
shall not amend the Debt Commitment Letter so as to provide for  any
additional closing conditions without the prior written consent of the 
Company.

**_Investigation  and Confidentiality_** **.**

(a) Prior  to  the Effective Time, each Party **** shall  keep the other
Party **** advised  of all material developments relevant to its business and
to consummation of  the  Merger and shall permit the other Party **** to 
make  or cause to be made such investigation of the business and properties
of  it **** and  its  Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and
legal conditions as the  other  Party **** reasonably  requests upon
reasonable notice and during normal business hours, provided  that  such
investigation shall be related to the transactions contemplated hereby  and 
shall not interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. No investigation 
by a  Party shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on the
representations  and  warranties of the other Party.

 

 

(b) In  addition to the Parties' respective **** obligations  under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which is hereby reaffirmed and adopted,  and 
incorporated by reference herein, each Party **** shall,  and shall cause its
advisers and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of  all  confidential
information furnished to it by the other Party concerning its  and  its
Subsidiaries' businesses, operations and financial positions and shall not 
use such information for any purpose except in furtherance of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated
prior to the  Effective Time, each Party shall promptly return or certify the
destruction  of  all documents and copies thereof, and all work papers
containing confidential  information received from the other Party.

 

 

(c) Each  Party agrees to give the other Party notice as soon as practicable
after any  determination by it of any fact or occurrence relating to the
other Party which  it has discovered through the course of its investigation
and which represents,  or is reasonably likely to represent, either a
material breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
the other Party or which  has  had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect  or  a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable; provided, however, that no  such  notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or  agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties  under this Agreement.

the opportunity to review  and comment on, any press release or other public
disclosure materially related  to this Agreement or any other transaction
contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  that  nothing in this _Section  8.7_  
shall be  deemed to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure which its
counsel  reasonably deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such
Party's  disclosure obligations imposed by Law (in which case such Party
shall promptly  inform the other parties hereto of such compelled
disclosure).

Each  Company Entity shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
entering  into  of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions  contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the
grant of any rights to  any  Person under the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other governing  instruments of any Company Entity or restrict or
impair the ability of Parent  or  any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or
otherwise to exercise the rights of a  stockholder with respect to, shares of
any Company Entity that may be directly  or indirectly acquired or controlled
by them.

 

 

       **8.10**   |  

**_Indemnification_** **.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) From  the  Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective  Time occurs, the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify  and  hold harmless each person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the  date  hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of  the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified  Parties_ "),  against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and  reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys' fees and  disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding  or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,  arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was  an  officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or acting on  behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary whether or not in such capacity, whether 
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest 
extent permitted under the DGCL for officers and directors of Delaware 
corporations, except to the extent such the Indemnified Parties acted with 
gross  negligence or willful misconduct. Each Indemnified Party will be
entitled,  subject to applicable Law, to advancement of expenses reasonably
incurred in  connection with the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or  investigation from the Surviving Corporation pursuant, and
subject, to the  terms  of _Section  8.10(b)_.

 

 

(b) Any  Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this  _Section  8.10_ ,  upon  learning of any such claims, shall
promptly notify Parent and the Surviving  Corporation thereof; provided that
any delay in notification will not release  or  discharge the
indemnification obligation except to the extent, if any, that  such  delay
has actually prejudiced the Parent or Surviving Corporation. In the event  of
any such claims which relate to any Litigation (whether arising before or 
after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
have  the right to assume the defense thereof and neither Parent nor the
Surviving  Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses  of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified  Parties in connection with the defense thereof (except
as provided below);  _provided_ ,  that  Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this  _Section  8.10(b)_   to
pay  for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties; (ii) the
Indemnified  Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation;
and (iii) neither  Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement effected  without its prior written consent; and _provided_
,  _further_ ,  that  neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
have any obligation hereunder  to any Indemnified Party (i) when and if a
court of competent jurisdiction  shall  have determined by final non-
appealable judgment that the indemnification of  such Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by  applicable Law or (ii) to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction  shall have determined by
final non-appealable judgment that such the Indemnified  Parties acted with
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In any case where  the  Parent or
Surviving Corporation shall have assumed the defense, the Indemnified 
Parties shall have the right to participate therein, and shall have the
right  to  employ their own counsel which shall be at their own expense
unless (i) the  Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties
mutually agree to  the  retention of the same counsel, in which case such
counsel shall be retained  at  the expense of the Parent or Surviving
Corporation or (ii) the named parties  to  such claim include both the
Parent and Surviving Corporation, on the one hand,  and an Indemnified Party,
on the other hand, and the Indemnified Party shall  have been advised that in
the reasonable opinion of counsel that there may  be  one or more legal
defenses available to it which are different from or in  addition to those
available to the Parent and Surviving Corporation and that  the  assertion
of such defenses may create a conflict of interest such that it would  be
inappropriate for counsel to the Parent and Surviving Corporation to 
represent the Indemnified Party, in which case such counsel shall be
retained  at  the expense of the Parent or Surviving Corporation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The  certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall  contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification,  advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and
former directors and  officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are
presently set forth in  the  Company's certificate of incorporation and by-
laws, which provisions shall not  be amended, modified or repealed for a
period of six years time from the  Effective Time in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder  of  individuals who, at or prior to
the Effective Time, were officers or directors  of the Company, unless such
amendment, modification or repeal is required by  applicable law after the
Effective Time.

 

 

(d) Parent  shall cause the Surviving Corporation (and the Company shall
cooperate prior  to  the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in
effect, to the extent  available, for a period of six years after the
Effective Time the Company's  existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy (provided that  Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor (i) policies of  at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which  are  no less favorable to such
directors and officers or (ii) with the Consent  of the Company given prior
to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect  to claims arising from
facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective  Time and covering
persons who are currently covered by such insurance;  _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  such insurance policies shall not be procured and/or
maintained if the annual  premium therefor shall be in excess of 250% of the
last annual premium paid  by  the Company prior to the date hereof (the "
_Insurance  Cap_ ");  _provided_ _further_   that if  the annual premium
shall exceed the Insurance Cap, then the Surviving  Corporation shall cause
to be obtained as much comparable insurance as can  reasonably be obtained at
a cost up to but not exceeding the Insurance  Cap.

 

 

(e) If  Parent  or the Surviving Corporation or any successors or assigns
shall consolidate  with  or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving  Person of such consolidation or merger or shall
transfer all or substantially  all of its Assets to any Person, then and in
each case, proper provision shall  be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving  Corporation shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section  8.10_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  provisions of this _Section  8.10_   are  intended to be in addition
to the rights otherwise available to the current  and  former officers and
directors of the Company by law, charter, statute, by-law  or  agreement,
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable  by, each
of the Company's director's and officers who are currently covered by  such
applicable insurance and their respective heirs and  representatives.

**_Access_** **.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

From  the  date hereof until the Effective Time, and subject to applicable
Law, the  Confidentiality Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the
Company shall,  upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours in a
manner that does  not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the business
operations of the  Company (i) give Parent and its Representatives and
financing sources reasonable  access, subject to Parent's and the Company's
compliance with applicable Law, to  the offices properties, books and records
of the Company and the Subsidiaries  and (ii) furnish to Parent, its
Representatives and financing such financial  and  operating data and other
information as such Persons may reasonably request  and  (iii) instruct the
Representatives of the Company Entities to cooperate with  all  reasonable
requests of Parent in its investigation of the Company and its  Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may restrict the  foregoing access
to the extent that (i) in the reasonable judgment of the  Company upon
written advice from counsel, any Law, treaty, rule or regulation  of  any
Regulatory Authority applicable to the Company requires the Company or  its 
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or 
information, (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the Company upon written
advice  from counsel, disclosure of any such information or document would
result in  the  loss of the Company's attorney-client privilege or (iii) in
the reasonable  judgment of the Company, such disclosure would result in a
material breach  of a  Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party on the  date  of this Agreement.

assignments,  documents, instruments, or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on  behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest,  perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any  and  all right, title and interest in, to and under any of
the rights, properties  or  assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired

Merger.

the Company as of the Effective Time (" _Continuing  Employees_ ")  shall 
receive credit for all years of past service with the Company for purposes

be eligible to participate  on  or after the Effective Time (" _New  Plans_

Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without

of each New Plan providing medical, dental, disability,  pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving  Corporation

Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of 
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements  applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable  plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New  Plan.

conditions of the employment of the  Continuing Employees, and nothing in
this Agreement shall obligate the Surviving  Corporation to maintain the

Company set forth in  this  Agreement shall be assessed as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the  Effective Time with the same effect as though
all such representations and  warranties had been made on and as of the
Effective Time (provided that  representations and warranties which are
confined to a specified date shall  speak only as of such date). The 
representations and warranties set forth in _Section  5.3_   shall be  true
and correct (except for inaccuracies that are de minimus in amount). The 
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections  5.21_ ,  _5.23_ , 
_5.24_ ,  and  _5.25_   shall be  true and correct in all material
respects. There shall not exist inaccuracies  in  the representations and

representations and warranties set forth in _Sections  5.3_ ,  _5.21_ , 
_5.23_ ,  _5.24_ ,  and  _5.25_ )  such  that the effect of such
inaccuracies (without regard to any materiality, or  Company Material Adverse
Effect qualifier(s) contained in any and each such  representation and
warranty) has, or would reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(b) _Performance  of Agreements and Covenants_.  Each  and all of the
agreements and covenants of the Company to be performed and  complied with
pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated  hereby
prior to the Effective Time shall have been duly performed and complied  with

(c) _Certificates_.  The  Company shall have delivered to Parent (i) a
certificate, dated as of the  Effective Time and signed on its behalf by its
chief executive officer or its  chief financial officer, to the effect that
the conditions set forth in  _Section  9.1_   as  relates to the Company

(ii) certified copies of resolutions duly adopted by  the Company's Board of
Directors and stockholders evidencing the taking of all  corporate action
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance  of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,  all
in such reasonable detail as Parent and its counsel shall reasonably 
request.

 

 

(d) _Absence  of Company Material Adverse Effect_.  There  shall not have
occurred after the date of this Agreement any event, change,  effect or
development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would 
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) _Dissenting  Shares_.  The  total number of shares of Company Common

holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger  or consented thereto in
writing, and who has properly demanded appraisal for  such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not have exceeded  5% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the  Effective
Time.

 

 

(f) _Consents  and Approvals_.  Each of  the Consents set forth in
_Section  9.1(c)_   of the  Company Disclosure Schedules shall have been
obtained, as well as any and all  Consents required to prevent any Default
under any Contract or Permit of the  Company Entities which, if not obtained
or made, would reasonably be expected  to  have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(g) _Financing_.  Parent  shall have received the proceeds of the financings
described in the Debt  Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing, if
applicable, in accordance with  _Section  8.5(c)_ ,  (sufficient, when
taken together with the proceeds of the Equity Financing  and  the Rollover
Contribution, to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the  aggregate
Option Settlement Payments and the aggregate Warrant Settlement  Payments
payable pursuant to _Sections  3.1 and 3.4_ ,  respectively); _provided_ , 
that  (i) this _Section  9.2(g)_   shall  not be a condition precedent to
the consummation of the Parent's obligations  under this Agreement solely in
the event that all conditions to the Debt  Financing or Alternative Financing
have been satisfied except those conditions  solely in control of the Parent,
the Insight Entities or the Bessemer Entities  and those conditions that are
not able to be satisfied solely because the  conditions that are solely in
control of the Parent, the Insight Entities or  the  Bessemer Entities have
not been satisfied; and (ii) notwithstanding _Section  9.2(g)(i)_ ,  this 
_Section  9.2(g)_   shall  continue to be a condition precedent to the
extent the failure to satisfy such  conditions to the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing that are solely in  control of the Parent, the Insight
Entities or the Bessemer Entities is caused  by any breach of this Agreement
by the Company.

 

 

(h) _Fairness  Opinion_.  The  Company shall have delivered to Parent an
executed copy of the Fairness  Opinion.

 

 

(i) _Resignations_.  Parent  and Merger Sub shall have received

force and effect.

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) _Representations  and Warranties_.  For  purposes of this _Section 
9.3(a)_ ,  the  accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub set  forth in this Agreement shall be assessed as of the date of
this Agreement  and  as of the Effective Time with the same effect as though
all such representations  and warranties had been made on and as of the
Effective Time (provided that  representations and warranties which are
confined to a specified date shall  speak only as of such date). There 
shall not exist inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Parent 
or  Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement such that the aggregate effect of
such  inaccuracies (without regard to any materiality, or Parent Material
Adverse  Effect qualifier(s) contained in any and each such representation
and warranty)  has, would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material
Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(b) _Performance  of Agreements and Covenants_.  Each  and all of the
agreements and covenants of Parent and Merger Sub to be performed  and
complied with pursuant to this Agreement and the other agreements 
contemplated hereby prior to the Effective Time shall have been duly

authorized officers, to the effect that  the conditions set forth in
_Section  9.1_   as  relates to Parent and Merger Sub and in _Sections 
9.3(a)_   and  _9.3(b)_   have  been satisfied, and (ii) certified copies
of resolutions duly adopted by  Parent's Board of Directors and Merger Sub's
Board of Directors and sole  stockholder, evidencing the taking of all
corporate action necessary to  authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, and the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, all in such reasonable  detail as the Company and its
counsel shall reasonably request.

 

 

       **9.4**   |  

**_Frustration  of Closing Condition._**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

No  Party  may rely on the failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 
9.1, 9.2_   or _  9.3_ ,  as the  case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such Party's failure  to act in good faith or failure
to use its reasonable efforts to consummate  the  transactions to the extent
required by this Agreement.

**TERMINATION**

 

 

       **10.1**   |

have been  consummated by May 15, 2007 (the " _End  Date_ "),  if  the

50

in this Agreement  and has not willfully breached any of such Party's
representations and  warranties contained in this Agreement) in the event of
a breach by the other  Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this  Agreement which breach would permit such Party

pursuant to the standards set forth  in _Section  9.2(a)_   or  _(b)_  
or  _9.3(a)_   or  _(b)_ ,  as  applicable;  provided that if such
breach in the representations, warranties, covenants  or  agreements is

_Section  10.1(c)_   prior to  30 days following the receipt of written
notice of such breach by the other  Party; provided that the failure of
Parent to deposit (or caused to be  deposited) the Merger Consideration in
the Payment Fund at the Closing prior  to  the Effective Time to the extent
required hereunder and to the extent all of  the  conditions set forth in
_Section  9.1_   and  _Section  9.2_   have  been met, shall not be
subject to cure hereunder, and in the event of such  breach, the Company may
thereupon terminate this Agreement immediately;  or

 

 

(d) By  either  Parent or the Company in the event (i) any Consent of any
Regulatory  Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions  contemplated hereby pursuant to _Section  9.1(b)_   shall 
have been denied by final nonappealable action of such authority or if any 
action taken by such authority is not appealed within the time limit for
appeal,  or (ii) any Law or Order permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise  prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated  by  this Agreement shall have become final and nonappealable;
or

 

 

(e) By  either  Parent or the Company in the event the Company Stockholder
Approval is not  obtained at the Stockholders' Meeting or at any adjournment
thereof where such  matters were presented to such stockholders  for 
approval and voted upon; **** or

 

 

(f) By  Parent  in the  event (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (or
the Special Committee)  shall have made a Change of Recommendation, (ii) the
Company materially breaches  _Sections  8.1_   or  _8.2_   hereof  or
(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Special Committee) 
resolves to take any of the foregoing actions.

 

 

(g) By  the  Company if the Board of Directors of the Company (or Special
Committee) shall  have made a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section  8.2(d)_.

 

 

A  terminating Party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other  Party  specifying the reason for such termination.

 

 

       **10.2**   |  

**_Effect  of Termination_** **.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

In  the  event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section  10.1_ ,  this  Agreement shall become void and have no
effect, except that (i) the  provisions of this _Section  10.2_ , 
_Section  8.6(b)_ ,  _Section  8.7_   and  _Article  XI_ ,  shall 
survive any such termination and abandonment and (ii) no such termination 
shall relieve the breaching Party from Liability resulting from any willful 
breach by that Party of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement
shall  affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the
Confidentiality  Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive such
termination or  abandonment in accordance with their terms.

the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant to this paragraph

subsequent obligation to pay the Termination  Fee  pursuant to this
_Section  11.2_.

Financing or Alternative Financing have been  satisfied (except those
conditions solely in control of the Parent, the Insight  Entities or the
Bessemer Entities and those conditions that are not able to  be  satisfied
solely because the conditions that are solely in control of the  Parent, the
Insight Entities or the Bessemer Entities have not been satisfied),  and (D)
the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Section  9.2(g)_   is
not  caused by any breach of this Agreement by the Company; then the Parent

as possible  (and in any event within 2 business days) following receipt of
an invoice  therefor, all of the Company's actual and reasonably documented
out-of-pocket  fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred by  the  Company on or prior to the termination of this
Agreement in connection with  the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Company  Expenses_ ")  as  directed by the Company in

(h) The  Parties acknowledge that the agreement contained in _paragraphs 
(b)-(g)_   of this  _Section  11.2_   are an  integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that  without the agreement,
they would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,  if  the Company
fails to pay promptly the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses payable  by it
pursuant to this _Section  11.2_ ,  then  the Company shall pay to Parent,
its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with
collecting such fee, together with interest on the  amount of the fee at the

a portion of the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses. The Company 
acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this  Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any document or instrument
delivered  in  connection herewith or therewith, the rights set forth in
_Section  11.2(g)_   shall be  the Company's or any of its Affiliates' sole
and exclusive remedy against the  Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, with respect to the  matters set forth in _Section 
11.2(g_ )  and  with respect to the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to
satisfy an obligation  due  to a failure to obtain the Debt Financing or the
Alternative Financing to the  extent the conditions precedent set forth in
_Section  9.2(g)_   are not  available pursuant to the terms thereof,
except as otherwise expressly set  forth  in the equity commitment letters
entered into with the Insight Entities and  the  Bessemer Entities in
connection with the Equity Financing.

requires the further  approval of the stockholders of the Company, without
such further  approval.

(a) Prior  to  or at the Effective Time, Parent, acting through its Board of

Default in the performance  of any term of this Agreement by the Company, to
waive or extend the time for  the compliance or fulfillment by the Company of

writing signed by a duly authorized officer of  Parent.

 

 

(b) Prior  to  or at the Effective Time, the Company, acting through its
Board of Directors,  chief executive officer or other authorized officer,

Agreement in one  or  more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a
further or continuing  waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of any
other condition or of  the  breach of any other term of this Agreement.

 

 

       **11.6**   |

and construed in  all  respects in accordance with the Laws of the State of

beneficiary of _Section 8.10_  to  enforce his or her rights thereunder)
shall be heard and determined exclusively  in the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware (or other appropriate state  court  in the State of Delaware) or

submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such state  or  federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware for the purpose of any proceeding  arising
out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party or any  beneficiary

the proceeding is brought in an  inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
proceeding is improper, or that this  Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein may not be enforced in or  by  any of the above-named
courts.

The  Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that  any  of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in

accordingly agreed that, except  as otherwise provided in _Section  11.2(h)_
,  the  Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches  of  this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof  in  any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being  in  addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in  equity.

 

 

       **11.13**   |  

**_Severability_** **.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Any  term  or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable
in any  jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of  such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable  the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity  or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions
of this Agreement in any  other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be  unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is  enforceable.

Each  Party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
any right  it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation
directly or  indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this
Agreement or the  transactions contemplated herein. Each Party (a) certifies
that no agent or  representative of any other Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise,  that  such other Party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that  foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that
it and the other Parties hereto  have  been induced to enter into this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated  herein, as applicable, by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and  certifications in this _Section

---|---

combination of facts  constitutes a breach of any of the representations or
warranties contained  in  this Agreement only if and to the extent that such
fact or combination of facts  has been disclosed in any Section of the
Company Disclosure Schedules in  sufficient detail and is reasonably apparent
to put a reasonable person on  notice of the relevance of the facts or
circumstances so disclosed. The  inclusion of any item in any Section of the
Company Disclosure Schedules (i)  does not represent a determination by the
Company that such item is "material" or has, or would reasonably be expected
to have, a Company Material Adverse  Effect and (ii) does not represent a
determination by the Company that such  item  did not arise in the ordinary
course of business.

**ARTICLE  IX**

 

 

**_CORPORATE  OPPORTUNITY_**

 

 

**9.1** In  anticipation that Insight Venture Partners V, L.P., Bessemer
Venture Partners  VI  L.P. and/or their respective affiliates (each, an "
_Investor_ ",  and  collectively, the " _Investors_ ")  will  be,
indirectly or directly, substantial stockholders of the Corporation, and 
in  recognition of (i) the benefits to be derived by the Corporation through
its  continued contractual, corporate and business relations with each
Investor  (including service of officers, directors, partners, managers,
employees or  affiliates of each Investor (collectively, " _Investor 
Persons_ ")  as  directors of the Corporation) and (ii) the difficulties
attendant to any  director, who desires and endeavors fully to satisfy such
director's fiduciary  duties, in determining the full scope of such duties in
any particular  situation, the provisions of this Article IX are set forth to
regulate, define  and guide the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation
as they may involve  the Investors and any Investor Persons, and the powers,
rights, duties and  liabilities of the Corporation and its officers,
directors and stockholders  in  connection therewith.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**9.2** Except  as  the Investors may otherwise agree in writing, each
Investor shall have the  right  to (i) engage, directly or indirectly, in
the same or similar business  activities or lines of business as the
Corporation and (ii) do business with  any  client, competitor or customer
of the Corporation, with the result that the  Corporation shall have no right
in or to such activities or any proceeds or  benefits therefrom, and no
Investor or Investor Person (except as provided  in  paragraph (c) of this
Article IX) shall be liable to the Corporation or its  stockholders for
breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any such activities  of such
Investor or such Investor Person's participation therein. In the event  that
any Investor or Investor Person acquires knowledge of a potential 
transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both the 
Corporation and such Investor, such Investor or Investor Person shall have 
no  duty to communicate or present such corporate opportunity to the
Corporation  and  the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or
expectancy it may have in  such  corporate opportunity, with the result that
such Investor or Investor Person  shall not be liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for breach of any  fiduciary duty, including for breach of
any fiduciary duty as a stockholder  of  the Corporation by reason of the
fact that such Investor pursues or acquires  such corporate opportunity for
itself, directs such corporate opportunity to  another person or entity, or
does not present such corporate opportunity to  the  Corporation.

 

 

**9.3** In  the  event that a director or officer of the Corporation who is
an Investor Person  acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter
that may be a corporate  opportunity for both the Corporation and any
Investor, such corporate  opportunity shall belong to such Investor, and the
Corporation hereby renounces  any interest or expectancy it may have in such
corporate opportunity, unless  such corporate opportunity is expressly
offered to such director or officer  in  writing solely in his capacity as a
director or officer of the Corporation,  in  which case such corporate
opportunity shall belong to the  Corporation.

 

 

**9.4** For  the  purposes of this Article IX, "corporate opportunities"
shall not include any  business opportunities that the Corporation is not
financially or contractually  able to undertake, or that are, from their
nature, not in the line of the  Corporation's business or are of no practical
advantage to it or that are ones  in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy.

 

 

**9.5** Any  person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest
in any shares  of  capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have
notice of and consented  to the provisions of this Article IX.

 

 

**9.6** For  purposes of this Article IX only, the "Corporation" shall mean
the Corporation  and all corporations, partnerships, joint ventures,
associations and other  entities in which the Corporation beneficially owns
(directly or indirectly)  fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
voting stock, voting power or  similar voting interests.

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything in this Certificate of Incorporation to the
contrary and in addition  to  any vote of the Board required by this
Certificate of Incorporation, the  affirmative vote of the holders of more
than eighty percent (80%) of the voting  power of the Common Stock then
outstanding, voting together with a single class,  shall be required to
alter, amend or repeal in a manner adverse to the interests  of any Investor
or Investor Person, or adopt any provision adverse to the  interests of any
Investor or Investor Person and inconsistent with, any  provision of this
Article IX.

**ARTICLE  X**

 

 

**_INDEMNIFICATION_**

 

 

A  director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation  or  its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a  director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the
director's duty of  loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for
acts or omissions  not  in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation  of  law, (iii) under Section 174 of the
DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from  which  the director derived any
improper personal benefit.

 



 

**10.1** _Right  to Indemnification_.  Each  person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or  is  involved in any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative
(hereinafter, a "proceeding"), by reason of the  fact that he or she, or a
person of whom he or she is the legal representative,  is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at  the  request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another  corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,  including
service with respect to employee benefit plans, shall be indemnified  and
held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the 
DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of
any  such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation  to provide broader indemnification rights than said law
permitted the  Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all
expense, liability  and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
ERISA excise taxes or  penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred  or  suffered by such person in connection
therewith and such indemnification shall  continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director or officer and shall  inure to the benefit of his or
her heirs, executors and administrators;  _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that,  except as provided in Paragraph (b) of this Article X, the Corporation
shall  indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with
a  proceeding (or part hereof) initiated by such person only if such
proceeding  (or  part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of
the Corporation.  The  right to indemnification conferred in this Article X
shall be a contract right  and shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses incurred  in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition;  _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  _however_ , 
that,  if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a
director or  officer in his or her capacity as a director of officer (and not
in any other  capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person
while a director  or  officer, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan)  in  advance of the final disposition of a
proceeding, shall be made only upon  delivery to the Corporation of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such director  or officer, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be  determined that such director
or officer is not entitled to be indemnified  under  this Article X or
otherwise.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

**10.2** _Right  of Claimant to Bring Suit_.  If a  claim under Paragraph
(a) of this Article X is not paid in full by the  Corporation within thirty
(30) days after a written claim has been received  by  the Corporation, the
claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against  the  Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in  whole or in
part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense  of 
prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than 
an  action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any  proceeding in advance of its final disposition whether the required
undertaking,  if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that
the claimant  has  not met the standards of conduct which make it
permissible under the DGCL for  the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for
the amount claimed, but the burden  of proving such defense shall be on the
Corporation. Neither the failure of  the  Corporation (including its board
of directors, independent legal counsel or  stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such  action that indemnification
of the claimant is proper in the circumstances  because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the  DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its board of  directors,
independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has  not  met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or 
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard 
or  conduct.

 

 

**10.3** _Non-Exclusivity  of Rights_.  The  right to indemnification and
the payment of expenses incurred in defending  a  proceeding in advance of
its final disposition conferred in this Article X  shall  not be exclusive
of any other right which any person may have or hereafter  acquire under any
statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation,  by-law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or  otherwise.

 

 

**10.4** _Insurance_.  The  Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any  director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation,  partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any such expense,  liability or loss, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to  indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the  DGCL.

 

 

Any  amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this
Article  X  shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director, officer,  agent, of other person existing at the time of, or
increase the liability of  any  director of the Corporation with respect to
any acts or omissions of such  director, officer or agent occurring prior to,
such amendment, repeal or  modification.
