corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

 

RECITALS

A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser
has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, including any associated
rights to purchase capital stock issued pursuant to the Company Rights
Agreement (" _Shares_ "), for $11.00 per share of Company Common Stock (such
amount, or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the "
_Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, without interest.

 

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") with the Company as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") in accordance with the DGCL, whereby each Share, except as
otherwise provided herein, will be converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price, in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

C. The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, approved this Agreement and
the Transactions and has unanimously resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company tender their shares to Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer, and, if necessary under applicable Legal Requirements, approve
the adoption of this Agreement.

D. The Board of Directors of Parent has, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, approved the Transactions.

E. The Board of Directors of Purchaser has determined that, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, this Agreement and the
Transactions are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of Purchaser
and its stockholders, and has approved this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

F. In order to induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the members
of the Board of Directors of the Company and the executive officers of the
Company are executing agreements to tender their Shares and to vote against
certain transactions (the " _Stockholder Tender Agreements_ ").

G. In order to induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser,
and/or the Company, as applicable, are entering into with those individuals
listed on Schedule 1 (i) an amendment to such employees existing employment
agreement, and (ii) proprietary information and inventions agreements that
will, in each case, become effective at the Effective Time (as defined
herein). AGREEMENT

 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1\. The Offer

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement
but in no event more than ten (10) business days after the date of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver by
Purchaser of the other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the "
_Offer Conditions_ "), promptly after the later of (i) twenty (20) business
days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under
the Exchange Act) and (ii) the earliest date as of which the Minimum
Condition has been satisfied and each of the other Offer Conditions has been
satisfied, or waived to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms of
Section 1.1(c), by Purchaser, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms, and accept
for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Expiration Date.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves
the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition
other than the Minimum Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall
not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased
in the Offer, (D) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that
adversely affects, or reasonably would be expected to adversely affect, any
holder of Shares, (F) change the Minimum Condition, or (G) extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or
permitted by this Agreement. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date), unless this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with Section 8\.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the

 



2  Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ " _)_ or, in the
event the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been
so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which
the Initial Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance
with this Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

(1) If on the scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition has not been
satisfied or any of the other Offer Conditions have not been satisfied (other
than conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer
Acceptance Time), or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder,
then prior to the then scheduled expiration date Purchaser shall extend the
Offer for one or more periods of not more than five (5) business days each (or
such other number of business days as the parties may agree and ending no
later than End Date in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions
(subject to the right of Purchaser to waive any Offer Condition (other than
the Minimum Condition) in accordance with this Agreement); and

 

(2) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by
applicable Legal Requirements, interpretation or position of the SEC or its
staff or NASDAQ or its staff, provided Purchaser shall extend the then current
Expiration Date of the Offer until the first business day on which the Offer
can be accepted under applicable Legal Requirements.

(f) Purchaser may (and the Offer Documents shall reserve the right of
Purchaser to) provide for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) in compliance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20)
business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) immediately following the expiration of
the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and
the Offer, Parent shall cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall, accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered during such subsequent
offering period as promptly as practicable after any such Shares are tendered
and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms
hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer, shall not acquire any Shares pursuant
to the Offer and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will
contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the
related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related
documents to be

 



3  disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Purchaser agree that they
shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto (which together constitute the " _Offer Documents_ ") filed by either
Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to promptly cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. The
Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and
Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Companys
stockholders that may be required in connection with any action contemplated
by this Section 1.1(h) including communicating the Offer to the record and
beneficial holders of the Shares. The Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents or the Offer.

(i) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.12, Parent shall cause to be
provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall
cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations
under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and
Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender
any Shares held by them into the Offer.

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that its Board of
Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests
of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with the requirements of the
DGCL, and (iii) resolved to recommend that stockholders of the Company accept
the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and, if necessary,
under applicable Legal Requirements, adopt this Agreement (such
recommendation set forth in this clause (iii) the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "). Subject to Sections 1.2(b) and 1.2(c), the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion of a description of the Company
Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as an " _Adverse Change Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve,

 



4  recommend or declare advisable, or propose or resolve to approve, recommend
or declare advisable, or allow any Acquired Corporation to execute or enter
into any Contract constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
be reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Transaction, or requiring, or
reasonably likely to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail
to consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or
be inconsistent with, the Transactions, except as expressly permitted by
Section 5.4(a).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to Purchaser accepting, for the first time, for payment the
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
satisfies the Minimum Condition (the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ "), the
Companys Board of Directors may make an Adverse Change Recommendation only
if: (i) the Company is not in breach of Section 5.4; (ii) the Companys Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse Change
Recommendation would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements; (iii) Parent shall have received from the Company prior
written notice of the Companys intention to make an Adverse Change
Recommendation at least four (4) business days prior to making any Adverse
Change Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation Notice_ "); (iv) if the
decision to make an Adverse Change Recommendation is not in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall comply with clauses (x) through
(y) as follows: (x) the Company shall have given Parent the four (4) business
days after Parents receipt of the Change of Recommendation Notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals and shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its Representatives to
negotiate with Parent) with respect to such proposed revisions or other
proposals, if any, and (y) after considering the results of negotiations with
Parent and taking into account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Adverse
Change Recommendation would constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; and (v) if the decision to make an Adverse
Change Recommendation is in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, then the
Company shall comply with clauses (A) through (D) as follows: (A) prior to
giving effect to clauses (B) through (D), the Companys Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Offer, (B) the Company shall have provided to Parent the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all material
documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section
5.4, (C) the Company shall have given Parent four (4) business days after
Parents receipt of the Change of Recommendation Notice to propose revisions
to the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals and shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its Representatives to
negotiate with Parent) with respect to such proposed revisions or other
proposals, if any, so that the Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute
a Superior Offer and (D) after considering the results of negotiations with
Parent and taking into account the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal remains
a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the Adverse Change
Recommendation would constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements. Issuance of any

 



5  "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company which
does no more than comply with the requirements of Rule 14d-9(f) shall not in
and of itself be considered an Adverse Change Recommendation that requires
the giving of a Change of Recommendation Notice or compliance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1.2(c). Neither the Company nor its Board
of Directors shall be permitted to recommend that the Company stockholders
tender any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer or
otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, unless in
each case, in connection therewith, the Companys Board of Directors effects
an Adverse Change Recommendation in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 1.2(c)
shall also apply to any amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or any
successive Acquisition Proposals.

(d) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced,
following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the SEC
and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that,
subject to Sections 1.2(b) and 1.2(c), shall reflect the Company Board
Recommendation. The Schedule 14D-9 shall include as an exhibit an Information
Statement pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other
applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to promptly be
filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel
with a written copy of any comments the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
receipt of such comments.

(e) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case
true and correct as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to
Parent such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders,
mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Parent and
Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all
copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their
possession or control.

 



6 1.3 Directors.

 

(a) Upon the Offer Acceptance Time and all times thereafter, subject to
compliance with applicable Legal Requirements and the applicable Marketplace
Rules of NASDAQ, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number
of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors
of the Company as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of
directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (after giving effect to the
directors elected or designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of their Affiliates bears to
the total number of Shares then outstanding. As used in this Agreement, the
terms " _beneficial ownership_ " (and its correlative terms) shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. The
Company shall, upon Purchasers request at any time following the purchase of
and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, take all such actions necessary
to (A) appoint to the Board of Directors of the Company the individuals
designated by Purchaser and permitted to be so designated by the first
sentence of this Section 1.3(a), including, but not limited to, promptly
filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board of Directors of
the Company, promptly increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the
Company (including by amending the bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to
increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are
necessary or desirable to enable Purchasers designees to be so elected or
designated to the Board of Directors of the Company, and (B) cause
Purchasers designees to be so appointed at such time. The Company shall, upon
Purchasers request following the Offer Acceptance Time, also cause Persons
elected or designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded
up to the next whole number) as is on the Board of Directors of the Company of
each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.
From and after the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall, at Parents
request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled
company" as defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(1) and make all
necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. The Companys
obligations under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly
upon execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders
(together with the Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Purchasers
designees to be elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the
Company. Purchaser shall supply the Company with, and be solely responsible
for, information with respect to Purchasers designees and Parents and
Purchasers respective officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1. The provisions
of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that
any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates may have as a
record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable
Legal Requirements with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company
to maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Board of Directors of
the Company on or prior to the date hereof and who are not officers, directors
or employees of Parent, Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates, each 

 



7  of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of
the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, and at least
one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Items
407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K (the " _Continuing Directors_ ");
_provided, however,_ that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due
to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary
action (including creating a committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or
designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person
(or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate three Persons who are not officers, directors or employees of
Parent, Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates to fill such vacancies and such
Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of
the Company after the Offer Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time,
then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in
addition to the approval rights of the Board of Directors of the Company or
the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the Company Charter
Documents or applicable Legal Requirements) be required (i) for the Company
to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the
Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would
adversely affect, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the
holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), (iii) to amend the Company
Charter Documents if such action would adversely affect the holders of Shares
(other than Parent or Purchaser), or (iv) to take any other action of the
Board of Directors of the Company under or in connection with this Agreement
if such action would materially and adversely affect, or would reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect, the holders of Shares (other
than Parent or Purchaser). The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent
shall cause the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such
counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company) in reasonable circumstances and other advisors at
the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors, and the
authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce
performance of this Agreement.

 

1.4 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company grants to Parent and Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the number of newly-issued Shares
(such newly-issued shares, the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
lesser of (i) the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares
owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of Shares that
would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Shares subject to
the Top-Up Option on a fully diluted basis or (ii) the aggregate number of
Shares that the Company is authorized to issue under its certificate of
incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed
for or otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A)
the Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

 



8 (b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in
part, at any time on or after the Offer Acceptance Time, in its sole
discretion; _provided, however,_ that the obligation of the Company to deliver
Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to
the conditions, unless waived by the Company, that immediately following the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares owned in the aggregate by
Parent and Purchaser constitutes at least one share more than 90% of the
number of Shares that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of
all Top-Up Option Shares. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all
applicable Legal Requirements, including compliance with an applicable
exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities
Act.

 

(c) The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be
determined by multiplying the number of Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer
Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Purchaser, at its
election, either (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by payment in cash of the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and payment of the balance by
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note (with full recourse
to Parent) having a principal amount equal to the difference between the
purchase price and the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares
or (iii) any combination thereof. Any such promissory note shall bear
interest at the applicable federal rate as determined for U.S. income tax
purposes, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and
delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid at any time without
premium or penalty; _provided, however,_ upon any Event of Default, all
principal and accrued interest thereunder shall immediately become due and
payable.

 

(d) In the event Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Parent or Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i)
the number of Top-Up Option Shares that Parent or Purchaser intends to
purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Parent or
Purchaser intends to pay the applicable exercise price and (iii) the place
and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares is
to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
Parent or Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Parent or
Purchaser (as the case may be) a certificate or certificates representing the
Top-Up Option Shares or, at Parents or Purchasers request or otherwise if
the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of
non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry Shares_
"). Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends required
by applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, and will
be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor," as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and will be acquired by
Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act.

10 2.5 Conversion of Shares.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) any Shares then held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

 

(ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly owned

(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest, subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance
with Section 2.6(e); and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the

the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

 

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of
such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such
shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates

 



11  and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If
the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing
Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) At any time following the 180th day after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to
look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for any
Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal
Requirements.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from
the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure
that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an effective affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which shall include an
agreement to indemnify and defend and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent from and against any and all costs, claims,
losses, judgments, damages, counsel fees, expenses and

 



12  liabilities whatsoever which each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection
with the failure of any statement, representation or warranty set forth in
such affidavit, any payment for or transfer, exchange or delivery of such
Certificate and such Persons inability to locate such Certificate, and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount (after giving effect to
any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.6(e)) equal to the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
that have been surrendered multiplied by the per Share Merger Consideration.

2.7 Appraisal Rights. The Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise
loses such holders right to appraisal of its Shares. If after the Effective
Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses such holders right to
appraisal, each such Share shall be treated as if it had been converted as of
the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration without
any interest thereon (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to Section 2.6(e)). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and, after the Offer Acceptance Time, direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Parent shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands. If any appraisal is made of Dissenting Shares and
the Top-Up Option was exercised prior to the Effective Time, then the cash
received and/or value of the promissory note received by the Company in
payment of the exercise price of the Top-Up Option shall be treated as if it
were not paid to or received by the Company and the Top-Up Shares issued upon
the exercise of the Top-Up Option shall be treated as if they were not issued
or outstanding in connection with the determination of the fair value of the
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

2.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

of phantom stock, stock appreciation right, profit participation right or any
other right that is linked to, or the value of which is in any way based on or

3.4 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

(a) Since December 31, 2009, the Company has filed on a timely basis all
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits
and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed with or
furnished to the SEC by the Company (such documents, the " _Company
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents. Except
to the extent that information contained in any Company SEC Document has been
revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date of this Agreement)
by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents when
filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes) contained or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i) complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ " _)_ applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be indicated in
the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under
the Exchange Act, and except that the unaudited financial statements may not
contain footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect); and (iii) fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby. No
financial statements of any Person other than the Acquired Corporations are
required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of
the Company. The books and records of the Acquired Corporations have been, and
are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP.

 

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since December 31, 2009 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Acquired Corporations; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial

 



17  statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
assets of the Acquired Corporations that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. The Companys management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and, except as set
forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and the Companys
independent registered accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn
or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
Since December 31, 2009, none of the Acquired Corporations nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, the Companys independent registered accountant has
identified or been made aware of: (A) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting utilized by the Acquired Corporations; (B) any illegal
act or fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Companys management
or other employees; or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of the
foregoing. 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of
the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.
The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing and corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select
Market.

(e) None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to or has any obligation or
other commitment to become a party to any securitization transaction, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Acquired
Corporations, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose Entity, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, any Acquired Corporation in any
Acquired Corporations published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents.

(f) There have been no written inquiries, interrogatories or comments with
respect to any of the Company SEC Documents from the SEC, NASDAQ or any other
Governmental Body received since January 1, 2010, and the Company has not
been made aware of any such inquiries, interrogatories or comments that were
oral. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from 

 



18  the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC
review and there are no inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any
internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of the Acquired Corporations.

(g) Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and
(3), since December 31, 2010, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
acting on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations has made, arranged,
modified (in any material respect) or forgiven personal loans to any executive
officer or director of the Acquired Corporations.

 

(h) Since December 31, 2009, (i) none of the Acquired Corporations or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any Company Associate, auditor, accountant or
representative of the Acquired Corporations has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Acquired Corporations or their
respective internal accounting controls relating to periods after December 31,
2009, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that
any Acquired Corporation has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices (except for any of the foregoing which had no reasonable basis), and
(ii) to the knowledge of the Company, no attorney representing any Acquired
Corporation, whether or not currently engaged by any Acquired Corporation, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities Legal Requirements
relating to periods after December 31, 2009, by the Company or any
Company Associate or agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof or, to the knowledge of the Company, to any director or
officer of the Company.

 

3.5 Absence of Changes. Since September 30, 2011 and through the date of this
Agreement, the Company has operated in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices and there has not occurred any event, change,
action, failure to act or transaction that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Since September 30, 2011 and through the date of this Agreement, the Company
has not taken any actions which, had such actions been taken after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, would have breached any of the
covenants set out in Section 5.3.

3.6 Title to Assets. The Acquired Corporations have good and valid title to
all assets owned by them as of the date of this Agreement, including all
assets (other than capitalized or operating leases) reflected on the unaudited
balance sheet in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2011 (the " _Balance Sheet_ ") filed by the Company with
the SEC (except for assets sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business since the date of such Balance Sheet). All of said assets
are owned by the Acquired Corporations free and clear of any Encumbrances
(other than Permitted Encumbrances).

 

3.7 Real Property; Equipment.

 

(a) The Acquired Corporations do not own and have not owned any real property.

 



19 (b) _Part 3.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate
and complete list of each lease or sublease pursuant to which any of the
Acquired Corporations leases real property to or from any other Person (the "
_Leased Real Property_ "). _Part 3.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of all Contracts for personal property
leased or subleased to or by any Acquired Corporation involving annual
payments in excess of $100,000 (" _Leased Personal Property_ "). True and
complete copies of all such leases or subleases with respect to all Leased
Real Property and all Leased Personal Property have been delivered or made
available to Parent on or prior to the date of this Agreement and each such
lease or sublease is in full force and effect. The Company or the applicable
Subsidiary holds a valid and existing leasehold interest in each Leased Real
Property and each Leased Personal Property. None of the Acquired Corporations
is in material breach or material default of its obligations under such
leases. (i) No lessor, lender of any lessor or subtenant of any Leased Real
Property located in Germany has given any notice to any Acquired Corporation
for the purpose of terminating or not renewing any material right of the
Acquired Corporation in respect of any such Leased Real Property, and (ii) no
lessor, lender of any lessor or subtenant of any other Leased Real Property
has given any written notice to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during
the past one (1) year for the purpose of terminating or threatening to
terminate any term, term extension, option or similar renewal right, right of
first refusal (or right of first offer) to lease or purchase any property,
lease expansion right or any similar right under the Leased Real Property or
Leased Personal Property. To the knowledge of the Company, no other party to a
lease or sublease with respect to Leased Real Property or Leased Personal
Property is in material breach of its obligations under such lease or
sublease.

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, (i) the Leased Real Properties located
in Munich, Germany and Rockville, Maryland are structurally sound, with no
material defects, and all building systems contained therein are in good
operating condition and repair, subject to ordinary wear and tear, (ii) the
use and operation of the Leased Real Property is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable zoning, land use, building, fire and other
applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) there is no existing plan or study by
any Governmental Body or by any other Person that challenges or otherwise
adversely affects the continuation of the present use or operation of any
Leased Real Property. True and complete copies of all Company Contracts set

or made available to Parent or Parents Representatives on or prior to the
date of this Agreement and each such Company Contract is in full force and
effect.

(d) All material items of equipment and other tangible assets owned by or
leased to the Acquired Corporations are adequate for the uses to which they
are being put, are in good and safe operating condition and repair (ordinary
wear and tear excepted and ongoing maintenance excepted), and constitute as of
the date of this Agreement all of the material assets and tangible
properties, tangible, real or personal, which are owned by the Acquired
Corporations.

3.8 Intellectual Property.

(a) _Part 3.8(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies (i) the
name of applicant/registrant and current owner, (ii) the jurisdiction of
application/registration and (iii) the application or registration number for
each item of Registered IP (A) that is owned

 



20  or purported to be owned by any Acquired Corporation or otherwise registered
or the subject of any application for registration in the name of any Acquired
Corporation or (B) exclusively licensed (except for which an Acquired
Corporation has no prosecution or maintenance obligations) to any Acquired
Corporations (the Registered IP described in this Section 3.8(a)(iii)(A) and
(B) is referred to collectively as the " _Company Registered IP_ "). As of
the date of this Agreement, no litigation, cancellation, interference,
opposition, reissue, reexamination or other proceeding of any nature is or has
been pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened, in which the scope,
validity, enforceability, or ownership of any Company Registered IP and, to
the knowledge of the Company, any Registered IP that is exclusively licensed
to an Acquired Corporation for which an Acquired Corporation has no current
prosecution or maintenance obligations (" _Licensed Registered IP_ "), is
being or has been contested or challenged. Each of the patents and patent
applications included in the Registered IP that are owned solely by the
Acquired Corporations (and, to the knowledge of the Company, each of the
Acquired Corporations co-owned patents and patent applications), properly
identifies by name each and every inventor of the claims thereof
as determined in accordance with the Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction
in which such patent is issued or such patent application is pending. _Part
3.8(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule describes each filing, payment,
and action that must be made or taken on or before the date that is one
hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of this Agreement with respect to
Company Registered IP and, to the Companys knowledge, Licensed Registered IP.
All registration, renewal, maintenance and other payments that are or have
become due with respect to Company Registered IP have been timely paid by or
on behalf of the Company or another Acquired Corporation. All Company
Registered IP and, to the Companys knowledge, Licensed Registered IP, is
subsisting and, to the knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable and in
full force and effect as of the date hereof, and has not lapsed, been
abandoned, been disclaimed, been cancelled or been forfeited, in whole or in
part. Neither the Company nor any of the Acquired Corporations has knowledge
of any ground for a bona fide claim challenging or affecting the
patentability, validity, enforceability of, ownership of or rights in, to or
under, any Company Registered IP or, to the Companys knowledge, Licensed
Registered IP. The Company and the Acquired Corporations have complied with
their duty of candor and disclosure to the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and any relevant foreign patent office with respect to all Company
Registered IP.

(b) The Company or another Acquired Corporation is the sole and exclusive
owner (beneficially and of record, where applicable) of all right, title and
interest in and to the Owned Company IP, free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than Permitted Encumbrances. The Acquired Corporations own, or hold a
valid license or other right to use, all Intellectual Property Rights that are
necessary for the conduct of the Acquired Corporations business as currently
conducted and as currently contemplated to be conducted by the Acquired
Corporation, except for any Intellectual Property Rights the absence of which
had not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Acquired Corporations (or, after the consummation of the
Offer, Parent or its Subsidiaries). All assignments of Owned Company IP to
the Company or an Acquired Corporation are valid and enforceable and have been
properly executed and recorded in compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



21 (c) _Part 3.8(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Company Contract pursuant to which any Intellectual Property Rights or
Intellectual Property, in each case that is material, individually or in the
aggregate, to the business of the Acquired Corporations as currently conducted
is licensed to or used by any Acquired Corporation (other than (A) software
license agreements for any third-party non-customized commercially available
software, (B) agreements between the Acquired Corporations and their
employees, consultants and independent contractors entered into in the
ordinary course of business but only to the extent that an Acquired
Corporation has obtained at least a non-exclusive interest in any Intellectual
Property Rights granted under such agreements or under applicable Legal
Requirements, (C) clinical trial agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business but only to the extent that an Acquired Corporation has
obtained at least a non-exclusive interest in any Intellectual Property
Rights granted under such agreements and (D) non-disclosure agreements) (each,
an " _Inbound License_ "). _Part 3.8(c)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule identifies each Company Contract pursuant to which there is an
outbound license of Company IP, other than any non-exclusive outbound license
of Company IP entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice (each, an " _Outbound License_ " and together with each Inbound
License, an " _IP Contract_ "). The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not create or result in any license,
waiver or other right or obligation under any IP Contract with respect to, or
any Encumbrance on, any Intellectual Property Rights owned or held by Parent
or any of its Affiliates, except as set forth in Company Contracts that are
listed Parts 3.8(c)(i), 3.8(c)(ii) and 3.9 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

(d) No Company Associate or individual who is or was an independent
contractor or consultant who was involved in the creation or development of
any Owned Company IP has any claim, right (whether or not currently
exercisable) or interest (excluding financial interests under applicable
German Legal Requirements) to or in any such Owned Company IP except for any
residual rights to use Owned Company IP for research only in the ordinary
course of business. No other Person has any ownership claim or ownership right
(whether or not currently exercisable) to or in any material Owned Company
IP. Each Person who is or was involved in the creation or development of any
Owned Company IP has signed a valid, enforceable agreement containing an
assignment of Intellectual Property Rights to the Acquired Corporations and
reasonable confidentiality provisions protecting the Owned Company IP which,
to the Companys knowledge, has not been breached by such Person. Such
assignments of Intellectual Property Rights to an Acquired Corporation by a
Person who is or was involved in the creation or development of any Owned
Company IP comply with the local Legal Requirements in which an Acquired
Corporation operates, including Legal Requirements regarding remuneration or
compensation such as the _Arbeitnehmererfindergesetz_ (German Employee
Invention Act), to effectuate a valid assignment. All remunerations due and
payable by any Acquired Corporation to inventors of the Owned Company IP by
way of contract or applicable statutory law (e.g., the
_Arbeitnehmererfindergesetz_ (German Employee Invention Act) have been fully
paid.

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, no funding, facilities or personnel of
any Governmental Body or any university, college, research institute or other
educational institution is being used, directly or indirectly, to create, in
whole or in part, Owned Company IP, except for any such funding or use of
facilities or personnel that does not result in such Governmental Body or
institution obtaining ownership rights to such Owned Company IP.

 



22 (f) Each Acquired Corporation has taken sufficient reasonable steps to
maintain the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and enforce its rights
in all material proprietary information held by any of the Acquired
Corporations, or purported to be held by any of the Acquired Corporations, as
a trade secret. To the knowledge of the Company, no trade secrets included in
the Owned Company IP have been disclosed to, used or discovered by any Person
except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-disclosure agreements which have
not been breached.

 

(g) None of the Acquired Corporations is now or has ever been a member or
promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or any similar
organization that would reasonably be expected to require or obligate any of
the Acquired Corporations to grant or offer to any other Person any license or
right to any Company IP.

 

(h) (i) The operation of the business of the Acquired Corporations as
currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate,
and has not infringed, misappropriated or violated, any Intellectual Property
Rights owned or held by any other Person; (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, the commercialization of any Company Product as currently
contemplated by any Acquired Corporation will not infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate any rights in or to Registered IP, trade secrets or know-how
owned or held by any other Person existing as of the date of this Agreement;
and (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, no other Person is infringing,
misappropriating, or violating any material Company IP. No Legal Proceeding
has been asserted since May 1, 2006 or is pending and served (or, to the
knowledge of the Company, is being threatened or is pending and has not been
served) against the Acquired Corporations or by the Acquired Corporations
relating to any actual, alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation or
violation of any Intellectual Property Rights of another Person or to the
Acquired Corporations Registered IP or any of the Acquired Corporations
Intellectual Property Rights. For the past three years, none of the Acquired
Corporations has received any notice or other written communication
(including any written offers to license) relating to any actual, alleged or
suspected infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual
Property Right of another Person by any of the Acquired Corporations. 

(i) Except as set forth in documentation that the Company has delivered or
otherwise made available to Parent or its Representatives on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no pending
patent applications of any other Person that the Company reasonably considers
would be materially relevant to the Companys current plan to commercialize
Company Products as contemplated by the Company if such patent applications
were issued as patents.

(j) None of the Owned Company IP and none of the material Company IP licensed
to the Acquired Corporations is subject (but, only in the case of material
Company IP licensed to the Acquired Corporations, to the knowledge of the
Company) to any pending or outstanding injunction, directive, order, decree,
award, settlement, judgment, or other disposition of dispute that adversely
restricts the use, transfer, registration or licensing of any such Company IP
by the Acquired Corporations, or otherwise adversely affects the validity,
scope, use, registrability, or enforceability of any Company IP. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
alter, encumber, impair or extinguish the Acquired Corporations rights in
any Company IP.

 



23 (k) Each Person, including each Company Associate or vendor to any Acquired
Corporation, past and present, to whom any Acquired Corporation has given
access to its confidential information relating to the Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property Rights owned, licensed or used by any of the
Acquired Corporations, is a party to a written Contract under which each such
Person is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of such confidential
information.

3.17 Environmental Matters.

 

(a) Each Acquired Corporation is, and has at all times been, in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws (except where
the failure to comply with Environmental Laws did not and would not
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impose or result
in a material liability that is the responsibility of the Acquired
Corporations). During the past three (3) years, neither the Company, nor any
other Acquired Corporation, has received any written notice from a
Governmental Body or any other Person that alleges that any Acquired
Corporation or other occupant of any Leased Real Property has been in
violation of, or is subject to liability under, in any material respect any
Environmental Law. To the knowledge of the Company, no current or prior owner
or occupant of any property leased, owned or controlled by the Acquired
Corporations has received any written notice from a Governmental Body or any
other Person that alleges that such current or prior owner or occupant or any
Acquired Corporation has been in violation of, or is subject to liability
under, in any material respect any Environmental Law.

(b) Neither the Company nor any other Acquired Corporation has installed or
used any of the following in connection with its business, and to the
knowledge of the Company, none of the following are present at the Leased Real
Property: (i) underground storage tanks for Hazardous Materials; (ii) any
landfill or other unit for the treatment or disposal of Hazardous Materials;
(iii) filled in land or wetlands; (iv) PCBs; (v) toxic mold; (vi) lead-based
paint; or (vii) asbestos-containing materials. Except as would not result in
material liability to the Acquired Corporations, there has not been, and the
Acquired Corporations have not caused, any Release of Hazardous Materials at,
on, under or from any real property currently or formerly owned, operated or
leased by the Acquired Corporations, during the period of such ownership,
operation, or tenancy, and to the Companys knowledge, there has been no
Release of Hazardous Materials at, on, under, or from the Leased
Real Property. None of the Acquired Corporations is subject to any order,
decree, injunction or other arrangement with any Governmental Body relating to
liability or obligations under any Environmental Law. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no other circumstances or conditions involving any
Acquired Corporation that could reasonably be likely to result in any material
claim, liability, investigation, cost or restriction on the ownership,
operation, use, or transfer of any property pursuant to any Environmental
Law.

 



38 (c) The Acquired Corporations have made available to Parent or Parents
Representatives on or prior to the date of this Agreement copies of all
environmental assessments, reports, studies, sampling data, audits and all
material documents in their possession (in each case, that is dated within the
last four (4) years) that relate to (1) any non-compliance by the Acquired
Corporations in any material respect with Environmental Laws or (2) the
environmental condition of any real property that the Company or any other
Acquired Corporation has owned, operated or leased that would reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability of any of the Acquired
Corporations.

insurance policy under which any Acquired Corporation is an insured or
otherwise the principal beneficiary of coverage, and all material self

operations of the Acquired Corporations. The Company has delivered or
otherwise made available to Parent or Parents Representatives on or prior to
the date of this Agreement true and complete copies of all such policies,
programs and arrangements and, to the knowledge of the Company, all such
policies, programs and arrangements are in full force and effect. With respect
to any policy in effect on January 1, 2011, no party to any such policies,
programs or arrangements has given to any of the Acquired Corporations any
written notice of termination or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
termination of such policies, programs or arrangements. The Acquired
Corporations are presently insured for reasonable amounts with financially
sound and reputable insurance companies against such risks as similarly
situated companies engaged in a similar business would, in accordance with
good business practice, customarily be insured.

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no claim pending under any of
the Acquired Corporations insurance policies or fidelity bonds as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed, in whole or in part, by the
underwriters of such policies or bonds. The Acquired Corporations are in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of such policies and bonds
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred which, with notice
or lapse of time, would constitute a breach or default, or permit termination
or modification, under any such policy or bond. The Company has no knowledge
as of the date of this Agreement of any threatened termination of, or material
premium increase with respect to, or the future unavailability on
substantially the same terms of, any of such policies or bonds.

Agreement, there is no transaction, or series of similar transactions,
agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor is there any proposed
transaction or series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or

party that would be required to be reported by the Company pursuant to Item
404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no Company Contracts that provide for payments by or to
any Acquired Corporation in excess of $15,000 individually between any
Acquired Corporation and any stockholder known by the Company to hold five
percent or more of any class of outstanding equity securities of the Company
or, to the Companys knowledge, any Affiliate of such Person. The Company has

5.4 No Solicitation.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Acquired Corporations shall not, and
shall not authorize or permit their Representatives to, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly induce, facilitate or
encourage the submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal
(including by granting any waiver under Section 203 of the DGCL) or any
inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to

from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Acquired Corporations to,
or entering into discussions with, any Person in response to a bona-fide
written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted after the date of this
Agreement to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn) if (1) neither any
Acquired Corporation nor any Representative of any of the
Acquired Corporations shall have breached or taken any action inconsistent
with any of the provisions set forth in Section 1.2(c) or this Section 5.4,
(2) the Board of Directors of the

 



50  Company concludes in good faith that such bona-fide written Acquisition
Proposal would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer and, after
consulting with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Companys Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements, (3) at least two (2) business days prior to furnishing
any such nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions with, such
Person, Parent receives written notice from the Company of the identity of
such Person and of the Companys intention to furnish nonpublic information
to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, and the Company receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement in a customary form that is
no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (which
the Company may negotiate with the Person during the two (2) business day
notice period), and (4) the Company concurrently furnishes all such nonpublic
information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously furnished or made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of or the taking of any
action inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any Acquired Corporation
acting on behalf of the Company or any Acquired Corporation, shall be deemed
to constitute a breach of this Section 5.4 by the Company.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly (and in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal,
any inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
relating to any of the Acquired Corporations including (A) the identity of
the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication
of interest or request and (B) a copy of all written materials and
communications provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest or request submitted by any Person during the
Pre-Closing Period. After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request, the Company shall continue promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) to keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request (including notice of all material amendments
or proposed material amendments thereto) and provide to Parent a copy of all
written materials subsequently provided to any Acquired Corporation or its
Representatives in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request. 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Acquired Corporations shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions with
any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or
indication of interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) calendar days following
the execution of this Agreement) demand that each Person that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement with any Acquired Corporation or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to such Persons consideration
of a possible Acquisition Proposal or equity investment at any time after
January 1, 2011 (other than agreements that have expired by their terms) to
immediately return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in
writing by such Person to the Company) all confidential information heretofore
furnished by any Acquired Corporation or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives to such Person, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Affiliates or Representatives.

 



51 (d) The Company agrees, except as determined by the Companys Board of
Directors in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that the
failure to take such action would constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements, not to release or permit the release during the Pre-
Closing Period of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any
provision of, the Company Rights Agreement or any confidentiality,
"standstill", or similar agreement to which any of the Acquired Corporations
is a party and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or
cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent.

 

5.5 Third Party Notices. The Company shall coordinate with and reasonably
assist Parent in the preparation and distribution of notices informing all
material Collaboration Partners of the Offer and Merger. The Company shall
also provide Parent with reasonable status updates in respect of any change of
control notices required to be delivered pursuant to any Material Contract.

Company shall, subject to Sections 1.2(b), 1.2(c) and 5.4, and as promptly as
practicable following the expiration of the Offer, take all action necessary
under all applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a
meeting of the holders of Shares to vote on the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Company
shall ensure that all proxies solicited by the Company in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable

hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent an
opportunity to review any written correspondence with the SEC or its staff or
any proposed

 



52  material to be included in the Proxy Statement prior to transmission to the
SEC or its staff and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree

in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, and the Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement, as
so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its
staff).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Purchaser shall own by virtue of the Offer or otherwise at least 90% of the
outstanding Shares, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the merger of Purchaser and the Company to become effective as
soon as reasonably practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a
stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their commercially reasonable
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement, and Legal Requirements to consummate and make effective the Offer
and the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing

all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Body in order to consummate the Offer and the Transactions;
_provided_ , that, in connection with obtaining any waivers and consents, the
Company shall not agree to any change to such Contracts that would be
adverse to the interest of the Company, its Subsidiaries or, after the
Merger, Parent without the prior written consent of Parent.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable)
shall: (i) promptly, but in no event later than February 6, 2012, file any
and all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such

expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods, as may be
required under the GWB (to the extent required); (iii) as promptly as
reasonably practicable provide such information as may

consummating and effectuating the Transactions, and (v) promptly take, and
cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonable actions and steps requested or
required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any
consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause
the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC and the DOJ, or other Governmental
Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations,
waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting
periods are required with respect to the Transactions; _provided_ that the
Acquired Corporations will only be required to take or commit to take any
such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such action,
commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Acquired
Corporations only in the event the Closing occurs;  _provided_ , _further_
that the Acquired Corporations shall only be permitted to take or commit to
take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, with the
prior written consent of Parent.

Subject to Legal Requirements relating to the sharing of information, Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Body in connection with
the Offer and the Transactions (including the Offer Documents and the Proxy
Statement) and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or
the Company, as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to
any documents or materials required to be filed under the HSR Act or the GWB,
or other laws of any other applicable jurisdiction that contain information
that is confidential or proprietary to the providing party (including any so
called 4(c) or 4(d) documents), such party shall not be required to provide
such information to the other party and may submit such information directly
to the third party and/or Governmental Body; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
review of any information would be material in connection with any second
request (or similar process outside of the United States) such information
shall be provided solely to those individuals acting as outside antitrust
counsel for the other parties provided that such counsel shall not disclose
such information to such other parties and shall enter into a joint defense
agreement with the providing party. In addition, except as may be prohibited
by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect
of the Transactions, each party hereto will

meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body
in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding.

Parent to agree to commit to any divestitures or licenses or to proffer to,
or agree to, sell or hold separate and agree to sell, before or after the
Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or
businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or
to consent to any sale or license, or agreement to sell or license by the
Company, of any of its assets or businesses) or to agree to any changes or
restrictions in the operations of any such assets or businesses in each case
to the extent such action would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, (x) restrict in any material respect or otherwise negatively
and materially impact the operation or ownership by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates of the Shares, the businesses or assets of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company and/or their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (y)

impact the operations, businesses or assets of Parent and its Affiliates
(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole (it being
agreed and understood that materiality for purposes of this clause (y) shall
be determined assuming Parent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, were the
size of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

6.3 Stock Options/Warrants.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether vested or
unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into only the right to receive
(without interest), after giving effect to any accelerated vesting at the
time of Effective Time contemplated under this Agreement or under the terms of
any Company Employee or individual award agreements, for the portion of each
Company Option that is (i) vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time,
an amount in cash, payable as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later
than the second payroll period) after the Effective Time, equal to the product
of (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Offer Price over (2) the exercise price
per share of such vested portion of the Company Option, and (B) the number of
Shares underlying the vested portion of such Company Option, and (ii) not
vested as of the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of
(A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Offer Price over (2) the exercise price per
share of such unvested portion of the Company Option, and (B) the number of
Shares underlying the unvested portion of such unvested Company Option,
payable no later than the second payroll period after the applicable vesting
date of such unvested portion of the Company Option, _provided_ , that the
unvested portion of the Company Option shall remain subject to the same
vesting schedule and other relevant terms applicable to the Company Option as
in effect before the Effective Time and the holder of a Company Option must
remain in service to the Parent, Company or any of their affiliates through
the applicable vesting date to receive payment in respect thereof);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the portion of any such Company Option that, per
its terms, remains outstanding and unvested as of December 15, 2012, shall
vest on December 15, 2012, and the cash amount determined pursuant to this
Section 6.3(a)(ii) in respect thereof shall be paid no later than

 



55  December 31, 2012 or shall vest in full earlier if the Company Option
holders service to the Parent, Company or their affiliates terminates without
"Cause" (including because of the holders death or disability) or resigns
for "Good Reason" (each as defined below) before December 15, 2012, in which
case payment of the amounts herein shall be made by no later than the second
payroll period after the date of such termination; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any holder of a Company Option who is entitled to accelerated vesting
upon the Offer Acceptance Time notwithstanding the substitution and
replacement of the Company Option as set forth in this Section 6.3(a)(ii),
whether pursuant to a Company Employee Agreement, award agreement or
otherwise, shall have the accelerated vesting applied pro rata, on a grant by
grant basis, to each vesting tranche subject to such accelerated vesting,
such that the portion of each such vesting tranche that is not accelerated
will remain subject to the same vesting schedule in effect as of the date of
this Agreement. The foregoing conversion shall be determined and interpreted
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the unvested portion of any Company Option held
by an individual who is a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the
Company at the time of Effective Time shall be accelerated and become
exercisable in full upon the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section
6.3(a), the terms "Cause" and "Good Reason" shall have the meanings set forth
in the Company Equity Plan applicable to such Company Option or in any
individual employment agreement, if applicable.

(b) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary or required under the ESPP (including, if appropriate, amending the
terms of the ESPP) and Legal Requirements to terminate the ESPP effective as
of the Expiration Date, and shall cause each ESPP participants then current
ESPP account balance to be distributed in cash to such employee at the time of
plan termination.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Acquired Corporations, the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee (as defined below), as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections 6.3(a) and (b).

(d) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to assume, exchange or make payment with respect to all outstanding Company
Warrants and shall take all actions necessary and required to comply with the
terms of such Company Warrants.

 



56 6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period commencing upon the Effective Time and
continuing through the end of the year in which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall provide to each employee of the Acquired Corporations who
continues to be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation (or any
Subsidiary thereof) (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") total compensation
(including employee benefits other than equity based compensation and
retention benefits and based on bonus opportunity rather than actual bonus
payments) that is at least substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Continuing Employees shall be eligible for severance benefits as set forth in
_Part 6.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the foregoing:

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable, assume the liability for such
accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to
use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the
practice and policies of the applicable Acquired Corporation subject to the
cap on vacation accrual set forth in Parents vacation policy and subject to
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ that the accrued but unused
personal, sick or vacation time of each such Continuing Employee in excess of
80% of such cap shall be paid by Parent, the Surviving Corporation (or any
other Subsidiaries of Parent) as soon as practicable to such Continuing
Employee at such employees compensation rate in effect as of the Effective
Time.

(b) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) business days prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, the Acquired Corporations shall terminate any and all
Employee Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code,
effective not later than the business day immediately preceding the Offer
Acceptance Time. In the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be
terminated, the Acquired Corporations shall provide Parent with evidence that
such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution of the
Companys Board of Directors (the form and substance of which shall be subject
to review and approval by Parent) not later than business day
immediately preceding the Offer Acceptance Time.

(c) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit plans
to the extent that they were eligible to participate in such plans prior to
the Closing; _provided, however_ , that (i) nothing in this Section 6.4 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan at
any time, and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such
health or welfare benefit plan, then (upon expiration of any appropriate
transition period) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Continuing Employees to be eligible to participate in Parents health and
welfare benefit plans, to substantially the same extent as similarly situated
employees of Parent (taking into account job location). To the extent that
service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid
time off) under any health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such health or welfare benefit plan to (to the extent that it would
not result in any duplication of benefits), for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and allowances (including paid time off) but not for purposes of
benefit accrual or participation, credit Continuing Employees for service
prior to the Effective Time with the Acquired Corporations to the same
extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company.

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended nor
shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
Employee Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from amending or terminating any of its
benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any employee
to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary
of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee
shall be "at will" employment or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary

 



57  rights in any employee of the Acquired Corporations or the Surviving
Corporation, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective
bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms
and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or under any benefit plan which
Parent, any Acquired Corporation or the Surviving Corporation may maintain. 

(e) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Acquired Corporations shall use
commercially reasonable efforts not to communicate with employees of the
Acquired Corporations regarding the compensation, benefits or other treatment
they will receive after consummation of the Offer or the Merger, unless any
such communications are consistent with those developed in consultation with
Parent or this Section 6.4; _provided, that,_ Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to develop such a communication plan with the Company.

 

6.5 Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") will cause each Employee Plan and Company Employee
Agreement pursuant to which consideration is payable to any officer, director
or employee who is a holder of any security of the Company (each a "
_Compensation Arrangement_ ") to be approved by the Compensation Committee
(comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

Corporation (when acting in such capacity) as of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Acquired Corporations (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and provided to Purchaser or its Representatives on or prior to the
date of this Agreement) and as provided in the Indemnity Agreements (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, and provided to Purchaser or its
Representatives on or prior to the date of this Agreement), shall survive the
Merger and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to the fullest extent available under Delaware law for a period
of six years from the Effective Time, and any claim made requesting
indemnification pursuant to such indemnification rights within such six-year
period shall continue to be subject to this Section 6.6(a) and the
indemnification rights provided under this Section 6.6(a) until disposition of
such claim.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (together with
its successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to the
fullest extent that the Acquired Corporations would have been permitted to
under applicable Legal Requirements and their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer
or director of an Acquired Corporation against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, 

 



58  judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an officer or
director of an Acquired Corporation, to the extent arising out of or
pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim with respect
to the transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection
with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.6(b) within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, subject to the
execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings to repay
such advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement in the form made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives on or prior to the date of this Agreement on terms with
respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than
the existing policy or prior to the Effective Time and the Company may
purchase a six-year "tail" policy for the existing policy; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of the amount set
forth on _Part 6.6(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, it being understood
that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, or if such coverages are not available, Parent shall be obligated to
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount.

 

(d) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.6.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the acceptance of Shares

Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. This
Section 6.6 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the
Offer Acceptance Time without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person.

review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any securityholder litigation against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, and the right to consult on
the settlement with respect to such securityholder litigation, and the
Company will in good faith take such comments into account, and, no such

described in clause (c) above. In addition, during the Pre-Closing Period, the
parties shall coordinate with each other and the others Representatives with
respect to communications with Company Associates regarding post-Closing
transition, integration and related matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
