Option Release, and Parent shall be entitled to withhold payment to any such
Company Stock Option holder until such Option Release has been given.

  

Section 3.6 _Escrow Amount_. The Escrow Amount shall be deposited with
the Escrow Agent into an interest-bearing escrow account. The Escrow Agent
shall hold the aggregate

        

Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms and conditions of an escrow
agreement, by and among the Parent, the Shareholder Representative and the
Escrow Agent, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 3.6_ (the
" _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Amount shall remain in escrow following
the Closing for disbursement in accordance with the working capital
adjustment set forth below and to cover any indemnification claims of Parent,
in each case in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, until: (i)
twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, at which time 50% of the remaining
and undisputed balance of the Escrow Amount (inclusive of any investment
earnings thereon) shall be released to the Shareholder Representative, and
(ii) the remaining and undisputed balance of the Escrow Amount (inclusive of
any investment earnings thereon) shall be released to the Shareholder
Representative on the date which is eighteen (18) months from the date of
Closing (the " _Escrow Termination Date_ ").

  

Section 3.7 _Initial Working Capital Adjustment_. At least four
(4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
the Parent a certificate, executed by the Company, setting forth a good
faith calculation of its estimate of Net Working Capital (the " _Initial
Working Capital Schedule_ ") and a determination of the Adjusted Merger
Payment, which shall be calculated in accordance with Section 3.2. The Parent
shall have the right to review and comment upon such Initial Working Capital
Schedule, and the Company shall provide Parent and its representatives
reasonable access to all books, records, and employees of the Company for
purposes consistent therewith.

  

Section 3.8 _Payment_. All payments required under this Article III or any
other provision hereof shall be made in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such bank account as shall be designated in writing by the
Parent or the Shareholder Representative, as applicable.

  

Section 3.9 _Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment_.

  

(a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Shareholder Representative a schedule (the "
_Parent Working Capital Schedule_ ") setting forth its good faith calculation
of the Net Working Capital. The Parent Working Capital Schedule shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP and the calculation of the Initial
Working Capital Schedule.

  

(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days following
receipt of the Parent Working Capital Schedule delivered pursuant to Section
3.9(a) during which to notify the Parent of any dispute of any item contained
therein (the " _Objection Notice_ "), which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. The Parent and the
Shareholder Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such
dispute as promptly as practicable, and upon such resolution, the Working
Capital Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the agreement of the
Parent and the Shareholder Representative. In the event the Shareholder
Representative does not notify the Parent of any such dispute within such
thirty (30)-day period or notifies the Parent within such period that it does
not dispute any item contained therein, the Parent Working Capital Schedule
delivered pursuant to Section 3.9(a) and the

        

ParentÂ’s calculation of the Working Capital Schedule, shall be final and
binding upon the Parties.

  

(c) In the event the Parent and the Shareholder Representative are unable to
resolve any dispute regarding the Parent Working Capital Schedule delivered
pursuant to Section 3.9(a) within thirty (30) days following the ParentÂ’s
receipt of notice of such dispute, such dispute shall be submitted to, and
all issues having a bearing on such dispute shall be resolved by BDO Seidman,
LLP, a nationally recognized accounting firm (the " _Accounting Referee_ ").
Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the selection of the Accounting Referee,
both the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall submit a calculation of
Net Working Capital and any supporting documentation to the Accounting
Referee.  Within twenty (20) Business Days of the timely receipt of the later
of such submissions, the Accounting Referee shall choose the one of the
two submissions that most accurately reflects what the actual Working
Capital Schedule should be and that submission shall establish the adjustment
to the Merger Payment. If only one of the parties makes a timely submission,
then that submission shall establish the adjustment to the Merger Payment.
The Accounting RefereeÂ’s determination of the Working Capital Schedule (the "
_Final Working Capital Schedule_ ") shall be final and binding on the
Parties. To the extent any facts and circumstances that constitute a breach
of any representation or warranty contained in Article IV or V also
constitute an adjustment that is reflected in the Final Working Capital
Schedule, the Parent shall not be entitled to an additional remedy under
Article XI to the extent of the adjustment in the Final Working
Capital Schedule. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee
shall be shared equally by (A) the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of
the Shareholders) on the one hand and (B) the Parent on the other hand, which
such amount in the case of (A) shall be paid out of the Escrow Amount at
the direction of the Shareholder Representative.

  

(d) If the Net Working Capital as finally determined in the Final Working
Capital Schedule pursuant to Section 3.9(c) is greater than that reflected in
the Initial Working Capital Schedule, then Parent shall promptly (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days of the final determination thereof) pay
to the Shareholder Representative such excess; provided, however, that the
total positive adjustment pursuant to this subsection (d) and the Initial
Working Capital Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 3.7 shall not exceed
$1,000,000 in the aggregate. If the Net Working Capital as finally determined
in the Final Working Capital Schedule pursuant to Section 3.9(c) above is
less than the amount shown in the Initial Working Capital Schedule, then the
Shareholder Representative shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination thereof) cause to be paid to the
Parent from the Escrow Amount an amount equal to such shortfall in accordance
with Section 3.8.

books and records of the Company at the lower of cost or market with the cost
determined under the first-in-first-out inventory valuation method consistent

the Company as of the date of such balance sheet, and each statement of
income and cash flows included in the Financial Statements (including the

Section 3(21) of ERISA) of any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Part 4
of Title I of ERISA has committed a breach of fiduciary duty that would
subject the Company or the Parent to any liability. The Company has not
been assessed any excise taxes under Chapter 43 of the Code and nothing has
occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is expected to subject
the Company or the Parent to any such taxes.  The transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not trigger any Taxes under Section 4978 of the Code.
No Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan is or was subject to Title IV
of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and no Company

"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), a "multiple
employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), or a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40)(A) of
ERISA), nor has the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates within the last
five years sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or had any liability or
obligation with respect to, any such Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate
Plan of the type described in this sentence.

  

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan has been established,
registered, qualified, invested, operated and administered in all respects in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with all Applicable Benefit Laws.
The Company has performed and complied in all respects with all of its
obligations under or with respect to the Company Benefit Plans. The Company
has not incurred, and no fact exists that reasonably could be expected to
result in, any liability to the Company with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan or any ERISA Affiliate Plan, including any liability, tax, penalty or
fee under any Applicable Benefit Law (other than to pay premiums,
contributions or benefits in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice).

        

There are no current or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened Liens on
any assets of any Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan.

  

(f) No fact or circumstance exists that could reasonably be expected to cause
a Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan that is intended to be tax-

maintained thereunder that are intended to be exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter with respect to all Applicable Benefits Laws on which the Internal

complaint, claim, charge, suit, proceeding or other action of any kind with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan (other than a
routine claim for benefits in accordance with such Company Benefit PlanÂ’s or
ERISA Affiliate PlanÂ’s claims procedures and that has not resulted in any
litigation) or (ii) proceeding, examination, audit, inquiry, investigation,
citation, or other action of any kind in or before any Governmental Entity
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan and there
exists no state of facts that after notice or lapse of time or both
reasonably could be expected to give rise to any such claim, investigation,
examination, audit or other proceeding or to affect the registration of any
Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan required to be registered. All
benefit claims have been paid in accordance with Applicable Benefit Laws and
the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan.

  

(h) All contributions and premium payments (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) that are due with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been made within the time periods
prescribed by ERISA and the Code, and all contributions and premium payments
for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are an obligation of
the Company and not yet due have either been made to such Company Benefit
Plan, or have been accrued on the Financial Statements. Adequate reserves
will be reflected on the Final Working Capital Schedule for any vacation,
sick pay, and other paid time off (i) accrued but unearned or (ii) earned but
unused, in each case as of the Closing Date by the CompanyÂ’s employees.

  

(i) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA), all
claims incurred by the Company are (i) insured pursuant to a contract of
insurance whereby the insurance company bears any risk of loss with respect
to such claims, (ii) covered under a contract with a health maintenance
organization (an " _HMO_ "), pursuant to which the HMO bears the liability
for claims or (iii) reflected as a liability or accrued for on the Financial
Statements. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.17(i)_ , no Company Benefit
Plan provides or has ever provided benefits, including death, medical or
health benefits (whether or not

        

insured), after an employeeÂ’s termination of employment, and the Company has
no liabilities (contingent or otherwise) with respect thereto other than (A)
continuation coverage required pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Part
6 of Title I of ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, and any other
Applicable Benefit Laws, (B) death benefits or retirement benefits under any
employee pension benefit plan, (C) deferred compensation benefits, reflected
as liabilities on the Financial Statements, or (D) benefits the full cost of
which is borne by the current or former employee (or the employeeÂ’s
beneficiary).

  

(j) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result (either
alone or in combination with any other event) in: (i) any payment of,
or increase in, remuneration or benefits, to any employee, officer, director
or consultant of the Company; or (ii) any cancellation of indebtedness owed
to the Company by any employee, officer, director or consultant of the
Company; (iii) the acceleration of the vesting, funding or time of any
payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or consultant of the
Company; or (iv) any "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code (whether or not such payment is considered to be reasonable
compensation for services rendered).

  

(k) The Company has not announced or entered into any plan or binding
commitment to (i) create or cause to exist any additional Company Benefit
Plan, or (ii) adopt, amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than
any amendment required by Applicable Benefit Laws. Each Company Benefit
Plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms without
liability to the Company or the Parent other than for benefits accrued up to
the later of the effective date or adoption date of such amendment or
termination.

change. Except as contemplated above, the Company and the Shareholders hereby
acknowledge that the Parent does not and shall not waive any right it may

In this regard, any judicial authority construing this Agreement shall be
empowered to sever any portion of the Territory, any prohibited business
activity or any time period from the coverage of this Section 7.10 and to
apply the provisions of this Section 7.10 to the remaining portion of the
Territory, the remaining business activities and the remaining time period
not so severed by such judicial or arbitral authority.

of the Company, (ii) be provided to the Shareholder Representative for its
review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such
Tax Return, and (iii) revised prior to their filing to reflect any changes
reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative. Except to the
extent such Taxes arise out of or relate to the Section 338(h)(10) Election
(as hereinafter defined) or are Transfer Taxes allocated to the Parent
under Section 7.9, the Shareholders shall reimburse the Parent for Taxes of
the Company with respect to such periods within fifteen (15) days after
payment by the Parent or the Company of such Taxes to the extent such Taxes

be timely filed any Tax Returns of the Company for Tax periods which begin

days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of

reflected as a liability in the Final Working Capital Schedule. For purposes
of this Section, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of
such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes
other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Tax period, any (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income
or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.

  

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Parent, the Company and the
Shareholders shall cooperate as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this

(i) The Parent, the Company and the Shareholders shall take all steps
necessary to make a timely, effective and irrevocable election pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and, if permissible, under any applicable
state or local income Tax laws) with respect to the acquisition by Parent of
the Shares to treat such purchase and sale as a deemed sale of assets for
federal income Tax and state income Tax purposes (collectively, the "
_Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "). The Parent, the Company and the
Shareholders and their respective affiliates shall report the transactions
consistent with such Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless and to the extent required to do so pursuant to a
final determination by the IRS or other applicable taxing authority.

  

(ii) The Parent, the Company and the Shareholders shall execute at the
Closing any and all forms necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10)
Election (including, without limitation, Internal Revenue Service Form 8023
and any similar forms under applicable state or local income Tax laws)
(collectively, the " _Section 338 Forms_ "). In the event, however, any
Section 338 Forms are not executed at the Closing, the Seller and Parent
shall prepare and complete each such Section 338 Form no later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the date each such Section 338 Form is required to be

after the Closing, a schedule allocating the Adjusted Merger Payment and the

Company.  Such schedule shall be prepared in good faith and in accordance
with applicable provisions of the Code.  Unless the Shareholder
Representative objects to the ParentÂ’s allocation schedule within ten (10)
days after receipt thereof, such schedule shall become final and, absent a
final determination by a governmental authority to the contrary, shall be
binding upon the Parent, the Company and the Shareholders for all federal,
state and local income Tax purposes. If the Shareholder Representative objects
to the ParentÂ’s allocation within ten (10) days of receipt, then the Parties
agree to meet and resolve the dispute in good faith.  Any such objection by
the Shareholder Representative shall be made in good faith and based on the
applicable provisions of the Code.

  

(iv) The Parent and the Shareholders agree that neither Party shall take any
action to modify or revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Election following the
filing of the Section 338 Forms, without the written consent of the other,
unless required to do so by any governmental authority. The Parent and
Shareholders shall not take any position for Tax purposes that is
inconsistent with such information without the prior written consent of the
other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

provisions of this Section 7.11(d) shall survive through the expiration of

discuss and meet, and shall cooperate in such discussions and meetings, with
any Customer of the Company that the Parent so requests. A senior executive
of the Company, reasonably satisfactory to the Parent, shall have the right
to accompany the ParentÂ’s representative to such meeting and shall
participate with the ParentÂ’s representative in any such discussions.
Furthermore, the Company and the Shareholders shall cooperate with the Parent
in the preparation of a presentation to such Customers with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. All costs relating to the actions
described in this Section 7.12 shall be borne solely by the Parent. The
Company shall promptly notify the Parent if a commercial relationship and/or
agreement it has with a Customer terminates during the period commencing on
the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit the Surviving Corporation to amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Surviving CorporationÂ’s articles of incorporation or bylaws
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers and directors
(unless required by law), unless pursuant to a separate written agreement
delivered by Parent, and reasonably satisfactory to such

        

officers and directors, Parent has agreed to provide exculpation or
indemnification to such persons on substantially the same terms and
conditions.

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain director and officer liability
insurance which insurance shall provide coverage for the individuals who were
officers and directors of the Company prior to Closing comparable to the
policy or policies maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Closing
for the benefit of such individuals.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Section 7.13 shall survive the consummation of the Closing for six (6)
years.

  

Section 7.14 _Accounts and Notes Receivable_.

  

(a) The Company shall cause all notes and accounts receivable and payable of
the Company owing by or to any Shareholder or any director, officer, employee
or Affiliate of the Company (each, an " _Affiliate Loan_ ") to be paid in
full at or prior to the Closing Date.

  

(b) From and after the Closing, if any Shareholder receives or collects
any Receivables, the Shareholder shall remit any such amounts to the Parent
or the Company within five (5) days of each day on which the
Shareholder receives such sum

  

Section 7.15 _Release_. In consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements
and warranties herein contained, and for other good and
valuable consideration the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, as of
and following the Closing Date, each Party to this Agreement (in such
capacity, a " _Releasor_ ") knowingly, voluntarily and unconditionally
releases, forever discharges, and covenants not to sue any other Party to
this Agreement (in such capacity, a " _Releasee_ ") from or for any and all
claims, causes of action, demands, suits, debts, obligations, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) of every kind
or nature whatsoever, known or unknown, actual or potential, suspected or
unsuspected, fixed or contingent, that such Releasor has or may have, now or
in the future, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from any act or
omission, error, negligence, breach of contract, tort, violation of law,
matter or cause whatsoever from the beginning of time to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the foregoing release shall not apply to: (i) any
claims arising out of this Agreement, Parent Ancillary Documents or the
Seller Ancillary Documents, or (ii) in the case of the officers of the
Company, any claims arising out of their fraud or willful misconduct. For
purposes of clarity, the Shareholders knowingly, voluntarily and
unconditionally release and discharge the Company and Parent for any claim,
cause of action, demand, suit, obligation or liability associated with the
CompanyÂ’s cancellation of indebtedness evidenced by certain promissory notes
dated (A) January 1, 2006 from Mark Pugh and Harold Deas, (B) August 1, 2006,

defense will be borne by the Indemnifying Party. In any audit,
investigation, action or proceeding for which indemnification is being sought
hereunder the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not
assuming the defense of such action, shall have the right to participate
in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such PartyÂ’s own expense. The
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party (as the case may be) shall at all
times use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party (as the case may be) reasonably apprised of the status of
the defense of any matter the defense of which it is maintaining and to
cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any
such matter.  If the Indemnified Party shall be

        

required by judgment or a settlement agreement to pay any amount or perform
any action in respect of any obligation or liability pursuant to which the
Indemnified Party may make a claim against the Escrow Amount, the Indemnified
Party shall make a claim with the Escrow Agent for such amount or the
reasonable and documented cost of performing such action (which shall include
all reasonable legal fees and documented expenses related thereto) to be
withdrawn from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms and provisions
of the Escrow Agreement, subject to this Article XI.

  

(b) In the event of a claim against the Escrow Amount, all such reasonable
fees and expenses in connection with the defense of such claim shall be
advanced from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and
Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall execute any joint written
notice to the Escrow Agent and otherwise to cooperate with the other in
obtaining such advance or advances of funds.

  

(c) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless (i) the Indemnifying
Party fails to assume and maintain the defense of such claim pursuant to
Section 11.5(a) or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party and its officers, directors,
employees and Affiliates from all liability arising out of, or related to,
such claim.  An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors,
employees and Affiliates from all liability arising out of, or related to,
such claim, (y) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any
wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (z) does not
contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any manner affects,
restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of
the Indemnified PartyÂ’s Affiliates.

  

Section 11.6 _Survival Period_. The representations and warranties of
the Parties contained herein shall not be extinguished by the Closing, but
shall survive the Closing for, and all claims for indemnification in
connection therewith shall be asserted not later than, eighteen (18) months
**** following the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that (a) each of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.1 (Organization),
Section 4.2 (Authorization), those provisions of Section 4.15 (Tax Returns;
Taxes) other than Section 4.15(q), solely to the extent that such provisions
of Section 4.15 relate to income Taxes only, Section 4.15(q), Section 5.1
(Authorization), and Section 5.3 (Ownership of Equity) (collectively, the "
_Surviving Representations_ ") shall survive and continue for, and all
indemnification claims with respect thereto shall be made prior to: (i) in
the case of those provisions of Section 4.15 (Tax Returns; Taxes) other than
Section 4.15(q), solely to the extent that such provisions of Section 4.15
relate to income Taxes only, and Section 4.15(q), the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, and (ii) in the case of Section 4.1,
Section 4.2 and Section 5.3, two (2) years following the

        

Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of
business on the last day a claim for indemnification may be asserted
hereunder, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim
for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved
or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall
remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved
or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

Section 11.7 _Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim
against the Shareholders (including the Key Shareholders) or the Company for
indemnification under Sections 11.1(a), 11.1(b) (except in the case
of Section 11.1(b), any covenants, agreements or undertakings set forth
in Sections 7.1(b), 7.1 (d)-(o), 7.1 (q)-(t), 7.2, 7.5, 7.9, 7.10, 7.14,
 7.16 and 7.17) or Section 11.2 for Losses unless and until the aggregate
amount of such Losses with respect to any claim or series of related claims
for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are otherwise entitled to
indemnification exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Parent Deductible_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that the Parent Deductible is intended as a
deductible). If the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Parent
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under the provisions
cited in the first sentence of this Section 11.7 exceeds the Parent
Deductible, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be paid the
excess of the aggregate amount of all such Losses over the Parent Deductible,
subject to the other limitations on recovery set forth in this Article XI.
The total aggregate amount of the liability of the Shareholders and the
Company for Losses with respect to any claims made pursuant to the provisions
cited in the first sentence of this Section 11.7 shall be limited to the
Escrow Amount and the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent shall be to proceed
against the Escrow; provided, however, that: (i) the liability of the
Shareholders for Losses arising out of or related to fraud shall not be
subject to the Parent Deductible or limited to the Escrow Amount, (ii) the
liability of the Shareholders for Losses arising out of or related to a
breach of any of the Surviving Representations shall not be subject to the
Parent Deductible or limited to the Escrow Amount, but shall be capped at the
amount of the Adjusted Merger Payment; provided further, however, Losses
arising out of or related to a breach of Section 4.15(q) shall be capped at
$10,250,000, and (iii) for purposes of calculating the Parent Deductible, any
breaches of any representation or warranty shall be calculated
without reference to any materiality or adverse effect qualifier or exception
set forth in such representation or warranty.

  

Section 11.8 _Investigations_. The respective representations and
warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement or any certificate or
other document delivered by any Party at or prior to the Closing and the
rights to indemnification set forth herein shall not be deemed waived or
otherwise affected by any investigation made, or knowledge acquired, by a
Party.

  

Section 11.9 _Calculation of Losses_. Losses shall be calculated net of any
Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of
the Indemnified Party as a result of the events giving rise to its right
to indemnification under this Article XI.

provided that the Parent shall, without the obligation to obtain the prior
written consent of any other Party, be entitled to assign this Agreement or

Section 12.5 _Captions_. The titles, captions and table of
contents contained herein are inserted herein only as a matter of convenience
and for reference and in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope
of this Agreement or the intent of any provision hereof.

  

Section 12.6 _Controlling Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the State
of Georgia without reference to its choice of law rules. Each Party
irrevocably and unconditionally (a) consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state courts sitting in Fulton County, Georgia and of the

Section 12.7 _Severability_. Any provision hereof that is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability
without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such
prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent

a Party of the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty.
A waiver by any Party of the performance of any act shall not constitute a
waiver of the performance of any

        

other act or an identical act required to be performed at a later time.
 This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented except
by written agreement of the Parties.

  

Section 12.11 _Integration_. This Agreement and the documents
executed pursuant hereto supersede all negotiations, agreements and
understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof

agreement among the Parties with respect thereto.

the appropriate gender. References herein to any Law shall be deemed to
refer to such Law, as amended from time to time, and all rules and regulations

all references in this Agreement to "Sections" and "Exhibits" are intended to
refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits of this Agreement.

3. **DISBURSEMENT OF ESCROWED FUNDS**

the Merger Agreement .

  

(b) From time to time on or before the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the

provided in Section 3(d) of this Escrow Agreement. Until such resolution, the
amount of the Claim shall not be paid by the Escrow Agent to either party.

  

(c) If no Counter Notice is received by Escrow Agent within such thirty (30)

pending Claims made prior to such date, shall be returned to the
Representative to be distributed to the Shareholders.

  

5. **DUTIES OF ESCROW AGENT**

  

(a) This Escrow Agreement expressly sets forth all the duties of Escrow Agent
with respect to any and all matters pertinent hereto. No implied duties
or obligations shall be read into this Escrow Agreement against Escrow Agent.

  

(b) Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty to give the Escrowed Funds held
by it hereunder any greater degree of care than it gives its own similar
property and shall not be required to invest any funds held hereunder except
as directed in this Escrow Agreement.

  

(c) Escrow Agent shall not be liable, except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct and, except with respect to claims based upon such gross
negligence or willful misconduct that are successfully asserted against
Escrow Agent.  Without limiting the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall in no event
be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any cash held
by it hereunder in good faith, in accordance with the terms hereof,

from its gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or
reinvestment of the Escrowed Funds, or any loss of interest incident to any
such delays.

  

(d) Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment,
certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it
hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the
service thereof. Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or
signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the
person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute
any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly
authorized to do so.

  

(e) Any payments of income from the Escrowed Funds shall be subject to
withholding regulations then in force with respect to United States taxes.

Agreement shall survive, notwithstanding any termination of this Escrow
Agreement or the resignation of Escrow Agent.     

(f) Escrow Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) may at any time resign as
such by delivering the Escrowed Funds to any successor Escrow Agent jointly
designated by the other parties hereto in writing, or to any court of
competent jurisdiction, whereupon Escrow Agent shall be discharged of and
from any and all further obligations arising in connection with this Escrow
Agreement. The resignation of Escrow Agent will take effect on the earlier of
(i) the appointment of a successor (including a court of competent
jurisdiction) or (ii) the day which is 30 days after the date of delivery of
its written notice of resignation to the other parties hereto.  If at that
time Escrow Agent has not received a designation of a successor Escrow Agent,
Escrow AgentÂ’s sole responsibility after that time shall be to retain and
safeguard the Escrowed Funds until receipt of a designation of successor
Escrow Agent or a joint written disposition instruction by the other parties
hereto or a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  

(g) In the event of any disagreement between the parties resulting in adverse
claims or demands being made in connection with the Escrowed Funds or in the
event that Escrow Agent is in doubt as to what action it should take, Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to retain the Escrowed Funds until Escrow Agent shall
have received (i) a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction directing delivery of the Escrowed Funds or (ii) a written
agreement executed by Parent and Representative directing delivery of the
Escrowed Funds, in which event Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrowed Funds
in accordance with such order or agreement. Escrow Agent shall act on such
court order without further question.

  

(h) Parent and Representative shall, jointly and severally, pay Escrow Agent
compensation (as payment in full) for the services to be rendered by Escrow
Agent hereunder in an amount set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and
agree to reimburse Escrow Agent for all reasonable expenses, disbursements
and advances incurred or made by Escrow Agent in performance of its duties
hereunder (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of its
counsel). Any such compensation, fee and reimbursement to which Escrow Agent
is entitled shall, as between Parent and Representative, be borne 50% by
Parent and 50% by Representative.

Shareholders agree to report the return of the Escrowed Funds to the
Shareholders pursuant to Section 4 hereof as a payment pursuant to an
installment sale, to be taken into account under the installment method
described in section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and (ii) Parent will be treated as owner of the Escrowed Funds, and Parent
will report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from,
the Escrowed Funds as its income in the taxable year or years in which such
income is properly includible and pay any taxes attributable thereto. Escrow
Agent shall for each appropriate year, prepare tax reports on Form 1099 and
deliver the same to Parent promptly after the calendar year involved.

 **Exhibit 7.18**

  

 **PERFORMANCE PAYMENT**

  

1. _Baseline Payment_. Parent shall make an additional one-time payment to the Shareholder Representative of $5,000,000 (the " _Baseline Payment_ "), in the event that Gross Profits (as defined below) of the Surviving Corporation for calendar year 2007 exceed the Baseline Amount (as defined below).

  

2. _Additional Payment_. In addition, for each $1.00 in Gross Profits above the Baseline Amount that the Surviving Corporation achieves during calendar **** year 2007, Parent shall make an additional payment to the Shareholder Representative of $2.78, up to a maximum of $25,000,000 in additional funds (together with the Baseline Payment, the " _Performance Payment_ ").

  

3. _Definitions_ :

  

" _Baseline Amount_ " means $36,000,000.

  

" _Gross Profits_ " means net sales of Pediatric Products to third parties,
less costs of goods sold, and gross fees in the case of Allegra, as
determined in accordance with ParentÂ’s internal accounting principles and
GAAP. For the avoidance of doubt, sales between Parent and its Affiliates
shall be excluded from the computation of Gross Profits, but Gross Profits
shall include the sale to third parties by any such Affiliates. Any royalties
associated with Lindane sales will be treated as a cost of goods sold for
purposes of the calculation of Gross Profit.

  

" _Earn-out Period_ " means calendar year 2007.

  

" _Pediatric Products_ " means the following products: Lindane, Methylin,
Orapred and Rondec.

  

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the same
meaning ascribed to such terms in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of April 23, 2007, by and among Sciele Pharma, Inc., SP Acquisition Corp.,
Alliant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the " _Company_ "), certain shareholders of
the Company, and John N. Kapoor, Ph.D. as the shareholder representative.

  

4. _Inventory Adjustment_. At December 31, 2007, Parent will obtain inventory reports for each of the Pediatric Products from the three major wholesalers (McKesson, Cardinal Health and Amerisource Bergen) which shall be aggregated (on a per product basis) to determine the total number of weeks worth of inventory of each Pediatric Product in the trade at the wholesale level (based upon the average demand of such wholesalers over the previous six (6) week period). The targeted inventory of each Pediatric Product shall be nine (9) weeks of inventory for such Pediatric Product, and any amount of inventory of a Pediatric Product in excess of such amount shall be " _Surplus Inventory_ " and any deficit of inventory of such Pediatric Product will be deemed " _Deficit Inventory_ ". At the same time, Parent shall determine for the preceding twelve (12) months the Gross Profit attributable to each Pediatric Product on a per commercial unit basis (based on actual net sales) (the " _Per Unit Gross Profit_ "). The Per Unit Gross Profit for each Pediatric Product shall be multiplied by the Deficit Inventory or Surplus Inventory of such Pediatric Product, as the case may be. In the case of Surplus Inventory as to a Pediatric Product, the amount calculated pursuant to the preceding sentence shall reduce the total Gross Profits otherwise calculated for purposes of Sections 1 and 2 above. In the case of Deficit Inventory as to a Pediatric Product, the amount calculated pursuant to the preceding sentence shall increase the total Gross Profits     

otherwise calculated for purposes of Section 1 and 2 above. In the discretion
of the Shareholder Representative the inventory amounts also shall be subject
to adjustment based on the monthly November and December "TRX Data" of
dispensed Pediatric Products (computing a weekly average for such two months
of data), provided by IMS Health, Inc. (" _IMS_ ") or, if such data is
unavailable from IMS, from NDC, Inc.

  

5. _Payments_. Within 90 days after the end of the Earn-out Period, Parent will deliver to the Shareholder Representative (i) a reasonably detailed calculation of Gross Profits and any Performance Payment based on such calculation, (ii) an accompanying certification from the Chief Financial Officer of Parent that such information is accurate and complete and has been prepared in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and consistent with the calculation as set forth on _Exhibit 7.18(a)_ , and (iii) a cash payment by wire transfer to an account designated by the Shareholder Representative of the amount of the Performance Payment specified in such calculation. Parent will, and shall cause its Affiliates to, support the Surviving Corporation in the continued advertising, marketing, promotion and other sponsorship of the Pediatric Products.

  

6. _Adjustments_.

  

(i) The Shareholder Representative shall have forty-five (45) days following
receipt of the calculation of Gross Profits during which to notify the Parent
of any dispute with respect thereto, which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. The Parent and the
Shareholder Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such
dispute as promptly as practicable, and upon such resolution, Gross Profits
shall be calculated in accordance with the agreement of the Parent and the
Shareholder Representative. In the event the Shareholder Representative does
not notify the Parent of any such dispute within such forty-five (45)-day
period or notifies the Parent within such period that it does not dispute any
item contained therein, the calculation of Gross Profits and the Performance
Payment delivered pursuant thereto shall be final and binding upon the
Parties.

  

(j) If the Parties cannot resolve their dispute within 30 days, then the
dispute shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm for final
resolution substantially in accordance with the procedures described in
Section 7.4 (c) hereof.  In the event the Parent and the Shareholder
Representative are unable to resolve any dispute regarding the calculation of
Gross Profits delivered pursuant hereto within thirty (30) days following the
ParentÂ’s receipt of notice of such dispute, such dispute shall be submitted
to, and all issues having a bearing on such dispute shall be resolved by BDO
Siedman, LLP, a nationally recognized accounting firm (the " _Accounting
Referee_ ").

  

(k) Within fifteen (15) Business Days of the selection of the Accounting
Referee, both the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall submit a
calculation of Gross Profits and the Performance Payments and any supporting
documentation to the Accounting Referee. Within twenty (20) Business Days of
the timely receipt of the later of such submissions, the Accounting Referee
shall choose the one of the two submissions that most accurately reflects
what the actual calculation of Gross Profits and the Performance Payments
should be and that submission shall establish the Performance Payment. If
only one of the parties makes a timely submission, then that submission shall
establish the Performance Payment. The Accounting RefereeÂ’s determination of
the calculation of Gross Profits shall be final and binding on the Parties.
The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be shared
equally by the Shareholder Representative and the Parent.
