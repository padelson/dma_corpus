3\. _Conversion of Shares_.

3.1 _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of the Company, Buyer, Merger Sub or
any stockholder of the Company or Buyer:

Stock_ ") that are held by the Company in the CompanyÂ’s treasury or otherwise
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than those to which _Section 3.1(a)_ applies and other
than any shares held by stockholders referred to in _Section 3.1(d)_, shall
be converted into and represent the right to receive an amount in cash (such
amount in cash being referred to herein as the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ ") equal to the quotient of (i) the Equity Value _minus_ the
Transaction Costs divided by (ii) the total number of Fully-Diluted Shares.
All shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares other than
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

The following terms used in the definition of Per Share Merger Consideration

" _Indebtedness_ " means the sum, without duplication, of (i) (A) all
principal and accrued (but unpaid) interest of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for borrowed money, and (B) capital lease obligations required  



 

2  to be disclosed on the face of a balance sheet prepared in accordance with
GAAP (plus, in the case of (A) and (B), all prepayment or other
penalties, make-whole amounts or success fees related thereto and any other
fees or charges associated therewith, in each case, to be incurred in
connection with the repayment thereof), and (ii) all amounts due to any
employee of or consultant to the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of
employment agreements (for the avoidance of doubt, other than compensation or
for services rendered or to be rendered), stay bonuses, severance payments, or
change of control or other similar payments in each case arising from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby which are payable or
accrue on or prior to the Effective Time, but not including any similar
amounts which accrue following the Effective Time, and any severance
payments with respect to the termination of those individuals set forth on
_Schedule 3.1(b)_ and (iii) any Management Fees accrued (but unpaid) through
the Effective Time.

" _Management Fees_ " means any management, consulting or advisory fees or
other amounts payable (other than the reimbursement of reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in connection with any actions taken on behalf of the
Company or its businesses or any services provided to the Company) to any
Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary, including without limitation,
Odyssey Investment Partners.

" _Transaction Costs_ " means, without duplication, the fees, expenses,
charges and other payments incurred or otherwise payable by the Company or
any Subsidiary in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as set forth on the Transaction Cost Statement,
which fees, expenses, charges and other payments shall include, without
limitation, (i) the fees, expenses, charges and other payments incurred or
otherwise payable by the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of the matters
set forth on _Schedule 3.1(b)_ , including any reimbursement of expenses to
Odyssey Investment Partners in connection with services rendered in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) one-half of any transfer Taxes
due in connection with or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby
("Transfer Taxes") (up to a cap of $137,500); and (iii) any fees payable to
the CompanyÂ’s independent accountant, whether or not previously billed by such
accountant, in connection with the 2006 audit to the extent such fees (A)
remain unpaid as of the Closing Date and (B) do not exceed $200,000; provided
that Transaction Costs shall not include Indebtedness, the employee bonuses
referred to in _Section 7.4.9_, the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect of all shares of Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_, or the Option Cancellation Payments.

(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary so that each outstanding
option to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under the Stock Option Plan
of Aviation Technologies, Inc. (the " _Option Plan_ ") or otherwise (each, an
" _Option_ ") to any current or former employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof (each, an " _Option Holder_ "), whether or not then
exercisable, shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, each Option
Holder shall be entitled to a cash payment (the " _Option Cancellation
Payment_ ") in respect of each such canceled Option equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess of (x) the Per
Share Merger Consideration over (y) the per share exercise price under such
Option.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
stockholder who is entitled to exercise and perfect, and has properly
exercised and perfected, appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
but instead shall have such rights as may be available under the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall effectively withdraw or lose his or her right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL, such stockholderÂ’s shares of Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and such shares of Common
Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares. The Company will give Buyer
prompt notice of all written demands received by the Company for appraisal
rights. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands. By virtue of the Merger, all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist and shall thereafter represent the right to receive only
those rights provided under the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a
holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any voting or
other rights of a stockholder of, or receive dividends or other benefits from,
the Surviving Corporation.



 

3 (e) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $.01 par value, of
Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon surrender of any
certificate representing fractional shares of Common Stock, the holder thereof
will be paid the cash value of such fraction, which shall be equal to such
fraction multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

3.2 _Payment_. Each stockholder shall surrender to Buyer at the Closing for
cancellation the certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented the outstanding shares of Common Stock owned by
such stockholder, accompanied by a transmittal letter in the form mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and the Company (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). Each
Option Holder shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing an executed Option
Cancellation Agreement substantially in the form mutually agreed upon by Buyer
and the Company (the " _Option Cancellation Agreement_ "). At the Closing,
each such stockholder and Option Holder shall be entitled to receive upon
surrender of his or her certificates and delivery of his or her Letter of
Transmittal or Option Cancellation Agreement, as applicable, the amount of
cash that such Stockholder or Option Holder is entitled to receive at the
Effective Time pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3_ and Buyer shall
promptly deliver the consideration due pursuant to _Sections 3.1(b)_  and
_(c)_ (less all applicable withholding and employment taxes) in accordance
with the instructions set forth in the Letter of Transmittal and Option
Cancellation Agreements.

If the consideration due pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ and _(c)_ is to be
delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the stock
certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a
condition to the payment of such consideration that the certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate powers
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, that such transfer otherwise be
proper and that the Person requesting such transfer pay to Buyer any transfer
or other taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the
satisfaction of Buyer that such taxes have been paid or are not required to
be paid.

3.3 _Full Satisfaction_. All consideration paid pursuant to _Section 3.2_
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Stock and Options.

3.4 _Closing of the Company Â’s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Common Stock or Options shall be made thereafter. If after the
Effective Time certificates for shares of Common Stock or Options are
presented to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Section 3_.

4\. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company represents
and warrants to Buyer and Merger Sub as follows, except as set forth in the
Schedules delivered by the Company to Buyer on or prior to the date of
execution of this Agreement and made a part hereof. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Schedules_ " shall mean written disclosure schedules
delivered by the Company to Buyer and Merger Sub on or prior to the date
hereof, copies of which are attached hereto, which set forth certain
exceptions to the representations and warranties contained in this _Section
4_ and certain other information called for by this Agreement. The disclosure
of any matter in the Schedules hereto shall be deemed to be a disclosure for
all purposes of this Agreement to which such matter would reasonably be likely
to be pertinent, but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission
by the Company or Buyer, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is
material for the purposes of this Agreement or otherwise. In addition, no
arrangement, agreement or transaction solely among the Company and one or
more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, or solely among one or more of the
CompanyÂ’s wholly-owned Subsidiaries and another wholly-owned Subsidiary, shall
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty included in this
_Section 4_, whether or not disclosed on the Schedules.

4.1 _Corporate Status and Authority_. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and is duly qualified and licensed to do business, and is in
good standing, as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
character of its properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to so
qualify and be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this  



 

4  Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to conduct its business and to own, use
or lease its properties and assets as now conducted, owned, used or leased.

authorized and approved by the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors and, immediately
following the execution of this Agreement, will be duly and validly authorized
and approved by the holders of the required percentage of Common Stock, and no
other corporate or stockholder actions or proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company or the by-laws of the Company, as the same have been amended from time
to time (the " _Certificate_ " and the " _By-laws_ ," respectively), to
authorize or approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Buyer and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect
which affect the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally or (b) general
principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.
The Company has delivered or made available to Buyer true, correct and
complete copies of the Certificate and By-laws. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any material adverse
effect on (a) the business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
each case, taken as a whole, or (b) the right or ability of the Company or any
Subsidiary to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.2 _No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals, etc_. (a) The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance of its obligations

not result in (i) any conflict with the Certificate or By-laws or the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar organizational documents)
of any of the Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to obtaining the consents referred to
in _Section 4.2(b)_, any breach or violation of or default under (A) any law,

are bound or (B) any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which any of them or their respective properties or assets
are bound, or (iii) the creation or imposition of any liens, security
interests, adverse claims, charges or other encumbrances (" _Lien_ "), other
than Liens created by or resulting from the actions of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, except, in the case of subsections (ii) and (iii), for such
breaches, violations or defaults and such Liens which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as set forth in this  _Section 4.2(b)_ and in _Schedule 4.2(b)_ ,
no consent, approval or authorization of, or filing with, or action by or
notification to, any Person or any governmental authority is required on the
part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except (i) filings required with respect to
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "
_HSR Act_ "), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the
DGCL, and (iii) filings, consents, approvals, authorizations, actions and
notifications which, if not made or obtained, would not, individually or in

(b) Each of the Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation, which is set forth on _Schedule 4.4(b)_ , and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business and to own or
lease its properties, as now conducted, owned or leased, and is duly qualified
and licensed to do business, and is in good standing, as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of such SubsidiaryÂ’s
properties owned or held under lease or the nature of such SubsidiaryÂ’s
activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to so
qualify or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
delivered or made available to Buyer true, correct and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or similar organizational documents)
of each Subsidiary, in each case, as amended to date.

4.5 _Financial Statements_. (a) The Company has delivered to Buyer copies

reporting Tri-Star Electronics International, Inc. as a discontinued
operation) and for the period beginning on May 23, 2003 and ended December
31, 2003 (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the unaudited
balance sheet and related statements of income and cash flow of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the eleven months ended
November 30, 2006 (the " _Unaudited Balance Sheet Date_ ") (such unaudited
financial statements, the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ ," and
together with the Audited Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_

4.5_ , the Unaudited Financial Statements) present fairly in all material
respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and
the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the dates and for the periods
indicated. The Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in effect in the United States
of America (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied throughout  



 

6  the periods covered thereby. The Unaudited Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as set forth in _Schedule 4.5_
) consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby, except for the
absence of footnotes and for normal year-end adjustments and
reclassifications, which adjustments or reclassifications would not be
material in amount or effect.

 

(b) The Company and each Subsidiary maintains, in all material respects,
accurate books and records reflecting its assets and liabilities
and maintains proper and adequate internal accounting controls that provide
assurance that, in all material respects, (i) transactions are executed with

obligations (absolute or accrued, contingent or otherwise, and whether due or
to become due and whether the amount thereof is readily ascertainable or not)
other than (i) liabilities or obligations under Contracts (it being understood
that, if required by this Agreement, such Contracts are disclosed in the
Schedules), (ii) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course
of business since the Unaudited Balance Sheet Date or (iii) liabilities or
obligations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is directly or indirectly liable upon or with respect to (by
discount, repurchase agreements or otherwise), or obliged in any other way to
provide funds in respect of, or to guarantee or assume, any debt, obligation
or dividend of any Person other than the Company or any of its wholly-owned

leasehold interests in the Leased Real Property listed on _Schedule 4.7(a)_ ,

or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings if a
reserve or other appropriate provisions, if any, as shall be required by GAAP
shall have been made therefor, (ii) Liens of carriers, warehousemen, mechanics
and materialmen and other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of
business for sums that are not yet due and payable, (iii) easements, rights
of way, title imperfections and restrictions, zoning ordinances and other
similar encumbrances affecting the Real Property, in each case, which do not
interfere with the ordinary conduct of the business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and do not materially detract from the value of the property to
which such Lien relates, (iv) statutory Liens in favor of lessors arising in
connection with any property leased to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which do not interfere with the ordinary conduct of the business of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and do not materially detract from the value of

Financial Statements (" _Permitted Liens_ "). The Real Property is used and
operated (i) in conformity with all applicable leases, and (ii) in conformity
with all applicable contracts, commitments, licenses, Permits and Laws, except

their respective businesses as

Closing Date, other than (a) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or
reflected in the Schedules hereto, or (b) as otherwise consented to by Buyer
in writing, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, conduct their business in
the ordinary course in substantially the same manner in which it previously
has been conducted and the Company shall not, and shall not cause or permit
its Subsidiaries to, take any action that if taken on or before the date
hereof would have caused a breach of _Section 4.14(i)_ through _(xvi)_
(other than  _Section 4.14(x)_). In addition, the Company shall not repay in
excess of $3,000,000 of Indebtedness (including the employee bonuses referred

Closing. 

6.2 _Satisfaction of Closing Conditions_. (a) The parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take all action necessary and appropriate
to bring about the satisfaction as soon as possible of all the conditions
contained in _Section 7_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the parties shall apply for and diligently prosecute all applications for,
and shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts promptly to obtain,
such consents, authorizations and approvals from such Persons and governmental
authorities as shall be necessary to permit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall require any of the parties hereto, or any
of their Affiliates, to make arrangements for, or to otherwise effect, the
cessation, sale or other disposition of, particular assets or categories of
assets or businesses. Subject to the foregoing, each party will refrain from
taking any action which would cause, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take any action necessary to prevent, any of the representations
and warranties made by it in this Agreement not to be true and correct in all
material respects at and as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect
as then made (except with respect to representation and warranties which are
made as of a specific date), subject only to exceptions permitted or expressly
contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto further covenant and agree,
with respect to any threatened or pending judgment, order, injunction, decree
or decision of any governmental authority that will adversely affect the
ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, to use all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry or  



 

20  promulgation thereof and to defend and cooperate with each other party
hereto in the defending of any legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative and whether brought derivatively or on behalf of third parties
challenging the transactions contemplated hereby, it being understood that
such efforts shall not include any requirement of the parties hereto to expend
material sums of money or grant any material financial or other
accommodation.

(b) Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby as soon as possible on the terms set forth in the Debt Financing
Document. The Buyer or Merger Sub shall give prompt written notice to the
Company if Buyer or Merger Sub amends or otherwise modifies any provision of
the Debt Financing Document, agrees to the assignment or novation of any
obligation of any lender party to the Debt Financing Document (other than
pursuant to the terms thereof), agrees to change any financial institution
that has agreed to provide financing pursuant to the Debt Financing Document
or waives the performance of any obligation of any party thereunder. If the
Buyer or Merger Sub amends or otherwise modifies, in any material respect,
any provision of the Debt Financing Document, agrees to the assignment or
novation of any obligation of any party to the Debt Financing Document, agrees
to change any financial institutions that have agreed to provide financing
pursuant to the Debt Financing Document, or waives the performance of any
material obligation of any party thereunder, in each case without the
CompanyÂ’s prior written consent, the Buyer and Merger Sub will not be deemed
to be in breach of this Agreement for purposes of _Section 8.1(a)_, but
rather this Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended to delete in
its entirety the condition to BuyerÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby contained in _Section 7.4.5_
and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Company agrees
to provide, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, agents, employees, financial advisors, counsel, accountants and
other representatives and Affiliates (collectively the foregoing Persons are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Company Representatives_ ") to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested in connection with the arrangement of such
Financing, including without limitation, participation in meetings, due
diligence sessions, road shows, the preparation of offering memoranda, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents, the execution
and delivery of any commitment letters, underwriting or placement agreements,
pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
requested certificates or documents, including a certificate of the chief
financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters and comfort
letters of accountants and such other certificates or documents as Buyer may
reasonably request from time to time.

6.3 _Access and Information_. From and after the date hereof and until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8_ and
the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives to, give Buyer and its representatives (including any
financial institution providing or proposing to provide financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) reasonable access at all
reasonable times and in a manner as to not materially interfere with the
normal business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the properties,
books, records, assets, data, documents, personnel, tax returns, title
reports, insurance policies and surveys and other information of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and to furnish such information and documents in its
possession relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as Buyer (or any
financial institution providing or proposing to provide financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) may reasonably request
from time to time, provided that neither Buyer nor any financial institution
providing or proposing to provide financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be entitled to access any properties of
the Company or any Subsidiary for the purpose of conducting any environmental
audit or assessment without the prior written consent of the Company. The
Company further agrees to furnish, and to cause its Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives to furnish, Buyer and its representatives (including
any financial institution providing or proposing to provide financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) with such financial and
operating data and other information which the Company or any Subsidiary has
reasonably available with respect to the CompanyÂ’s and each SubsidiaryÂ’s
business, properties, assets and financial and legal condition as Buyer or its
representatives (including any financial institution providing or proposing to
provide financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby)
may from time to time reasonably request. All such access, information and
documents obtained by Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) shall
be subject to the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of November
29, 2006 (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and

provide reasonable cooperation to such party and its counsel in the contest or
defense, make its personnel reasonably available, and provide such testimony

cured) or (iv) by either Buyer or the Company, if Buyer, in the case of the
Company terminating this Agreement, or the Company, in the case of Buyer
terminating this Agreement, shall (and the terminating party shall not) have
failed to perform and comply with all agreements and covenants required to

termination, with such exceptions as are not in the aggregate material, and
such failure shall not have been cured within 20 days following receipt of

obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, _provided_ that nothing
in this _Section 8.1_ shall be deemed to release any party hereto from any
liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or to impair the right of the terminating party to compel specific
performance under this Agreement.

8.2 _Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NO PARTY SHALL
BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY (INCLUDING ITS HEIRS, LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES,
SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS, AS THE CASE MAY BE, HEREUNDER) FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
