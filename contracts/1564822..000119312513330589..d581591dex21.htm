anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to transfer or

 



5  assign, directly or indirectly, any asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising under or resulting from such asset if an attempted direct or
indirect assignment thereof, without the consent, approval or authorization

claim or right, or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or
any of the Seller Affiliates or, upon transfer, Purchaser under such asset,
claim or right. If any direct or indirect transfer or assignment by Seller or
any of the Seller Affiliates to Purchaser, or any direct or indirect
acquisition or assumption by Purchaser of, any interest in, or liability,
obligation or commitment under, any asset, claim or right requires the Consent
of a third party, then such transfer or assignment or assumption shall be

Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates shall have any liability whatsoever to
Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
Consent that may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or because of any circumstances resulting therefrom.
Purchaser further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of
Seller herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be
deemed not satisfied, as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such
Consent, (ii) any circumstances resulting therefrom or (iii) any suit, action
or proceeding (a " _Proceeding_ ") or investigation commenced or threatened
by or on behalf of any person arising out of or relating to the failure to
obtain any such Consent or any circumstances resulting therefrom.

 

(b) If any such Consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing

secure such Consent as promptly as practicable after the Closing and Seller
shall provide or cause to be provided all commercially reasonable assistance
to Purchaser (not including the payment of any consideration or concession of
any right) reasonably requested by Purchaser to secure such Consent after the
Closing or cooperate with Purchaser (at Purchasers expense) in any lawful and
commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Purchaser under
which (i) Purchaser shall obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of
such third party or violating any Applicable Law) the economic claims, rights
and benefits (net of the amount of any related Tax costs imposed on Seller,
any of the Seller Affiliates or any of their respective affiliates) under the
asset, claim or right with respect to which the Consent has not been obtained
in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall assume any related
economic burden (including the amount of any related Tax costs imposed on

has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement.

auditors and other representatives any information reasonably requested and
shall provide them reasonable access at all reasonable times to such
personnel, properties and books and records related to the Business for such

(i) Unless Purchaser notifies Seller in writing within 15 days after Sellers
delivery of the Statement of any objection to the computation of Closing
Inventory set forth therein (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), the Statement
shall become final and binding at the end of such 15-day period. During such
15-day period, Purchaser and its representatives shall be permitted to
review the working papers of Seller relating to the Statement. Any Notice of
Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the objections set
forth therein and shall include a special purpose report of Deloitte and Touche
LLP (" _Purchaser s Accountants_") stating that they concur with the matters
set forth in such Notice of Objection and that such Notice of Objection has

15-day period, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 30-day period following
Sellers receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to
resolve Purchasers objections. During such 30-day period, Seller and its
independent auditors and other representatives shall be permitted to review
the working papers of Purchaser and Purchasers Accountants relating to the
Notice of Objection and the basis therefor. If Purchaser and Seller are unable
to resolve all such objections within such 30-day period, the matters
remaining in dispute that were properly included in the Notice of Objection
shall be submitted to KPMG LLP (or, if such firm declines to act, to another
nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Purchaser
and Seller in writing and, if Purchaser and Seller are unable to so agree
within 10 days after the end of such 30-day period, then Purchaser and Seller
shall each select such a firm and such

  



11  firms shall jointly select a third nationally recognized firm to resolve the
disputed matters (such selected firm being the " _Independent Expert_ ")). The
parties shall instruct the Independent Expert to render its reasoned written
decision as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 60 days after
its selection. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert
shall be final and binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert
shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable
and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction over
the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by Purchaser and
Seller. The fees and disbursements of Purchasers independent auditors
incurred in connection with their review of the Statement and certification
of any Notice of Objection shall be borne by Purchaser. After the Statement
shall have become final and binding, Purchaser shall have no further right to
make any claims against Seller in respect of (i) any element of Closing
Inventory that Purchaser raised, or could have raised, in the Notice of
Objection or (ii) any payment made pursuant to Section 2.03(c).

 

(c) _Adjustment Payment_. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount
by which Closing Inventory exceeds $20,000,000 (the " _Target Inventory_ "),
and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which Closing
Inventory is less than the Target Inventory (the Purchase Price as so
increased or decreased being hereinafter called the " _Adjusted Purchase
Price_ "). Within 10 days after the Statement has become final and binding in
accordance with Section 2.03(b), (i) if the Closing Date Payment is less than
the Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
such difference, plus simple interest thereon at a rate of 5% per annum from
the Closing Date to the date payment is made in full, and (ii) if the Closing
Date Payment is greater than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to
Purchaser an amount equal to such difference, plus simple interest thereon at
a rate of 5% per annum from the Closing Date to the date payment is made in
full (the Closing Date Payment as so increased or decreased being hereinafter
called the " _Final Purchase Price_ "). Any such payment hereunder shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be. 

(d) _Post-Closing Books and Records_. Following the Closing through the
resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 2.03, Purchaser shall not take any action with respect to the
accounting books and records of the Business on which the Statement is to be
based that could prevent, obstruct or otherwise affect (i) the results of the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.03, including the value of the Closing
Inventory or any other value set forth on the Statement, or (ii) the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.03, including the preparation of the
Statement or the resolution of any dispute regarding the Statement. During the
period of time from and after the Closing Date through the resolution of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 2.03, Purchaser
shall afford to Seller, and Seller shall afford to Purchaser, and any
accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by Seller or Purchaser, as
the case may be, in connection with any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 2.03 reasonable access during normal business
hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records of the
Business relevant to the adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.03.

being the subject of Section 3.06.

SECTION 3.06  _Intellectual Property_. (a) Seller or a Seller Affiliate is
the owner of the Transferred Intellectual Property and the Transferred
Technology free and clear of all Liens, and no license fees in respect of any
Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred Technology (other than
ordinary course software license fees) are paid or payable to any party
(including affiliated and non-affiliated parties) for the use by Seller or the
applicable Seller Affiliate thereof in those jurisdictions where such
Transferred Intellectual Property and Transferred Technology are being used.
Section 3.06(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the
registered (and applications for the registration of)
Transferred Intellectual Property (the " _Registered Business Intellectual
Property_ "), including the application and registration numbers and the
jurisdictions where such Registered Business Intellectual Property is
registered or where applications have been filed. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that Seller does not make any representations or warranties relating to
the trademark registrations and applications included in the Registered
Business Intellectual Property in jurisdictions other than those set forth in
Section 3.06 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(b) In connection with the Registered Business Intellectual Property, all
registrations are in force and all applications for the same are pending in
good standing and without any adverse post-grant proceedings pending before
the Governmental Entity in which the registrations or applications are issued
or filed. The Registered Business Intellectual Property is valid and
enforceable and none of the Registered Business Intellectual Property has been
declared invalid or unenforceable or has been limited by any court
or arbitration panel.

(c) Neither Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates has granted any license of
any kind relating to any Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred
Technology, except non-exclusive licenses to end-users in the ordinary course
of business. Neither Seller nor any of

 



15  the Seller Affiliates is bound by or a party to any material option, license
or similar Contract relating to any Intellectual Property of any other person
for the use of such Intellectual Property in the conduct of the Business,
except (1) for non-exclusive licenses to end-users in the ordinary course of
business and (2) for so-called "shrink-wrap" and other non-customized license
agreements relating to computer software licensed to Seller or the applicable
Seller Affiliate in the ordinary course of business.

(d) No material claims are pending or threatened in writing (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, material cease-and-desist letters or invitations-to-
license) as of the date of this Agreement against Seller or any of the Seller
Affiliates by any person (i) claiming that the use of any of the Transferred
Intellectual Property or Transferred Technology in the operation or conduct of
the Business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the Intellectual
Property of any such person or (ii) challenging the validity, enforceability,
ownership or use of any Transferred Intellectual Property or any Transferred
Technology (including cease and desist letters or invitations to take a
license). To the knowledge of Seller, the operation of the Business
as currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate
the Intellectual Property of any person. There are no pending proceedings
initiated by Seller or any Seller Affiliate regarding infringement,
misappropriation or other violation by any person of Sellers or any Seller
Affiliates rights to, or in connection with, the Transferred Intellectual
Property or Transferred Technology.

(e) Other than (i) rights in connection with co-packing arrangements and (ii)
cross-promotional rights entered into in the ordinary course of business,
neither Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates is a party to or bound by any
material license, sublicense, option or other agreement relating in whole or
in part to the Transferred Intellectual Property.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in either this Section 3.06 (other
than the second sentence of this Section 3.06(f)) or elsewhere in this
Agreement (other than Section 10.02(c)) shall be construed as a
representation or warranty related to the Additional Trademarks. Seller or one
of the Seller Affiliates is the owner of the registrations and applications
set forth in Section 1.02(a)(iv) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule for the
Additional Trademarks.

(g) None of Seller or Sellers Affiliates owns or controls any patents,
patent applications or patent rights that are used in the manufacture and
sale of the Products as of the date of this Agreement.

(h) The Transferred Intellectual Property, the Additional Trademarks and the
Transferred Technology comprise all Intellectual Property owned by Seller or
any of the Seller Affiliates necessary for the manufacture and sale of the
Products as of the Closing in a manner substantially consistent with the
manner in which the Products have been manufactured and sold by Seller or the
applicable Seller Affiliates prior to the Closing.

 

(i) All Transferred Technology has been maintained by Seller and the Seller
Affiliates subject to secrecy safeguards in a manner substantially consistent
with the manner in which Seller maintains the confidentiality of its
Technology generally. To the knowledge of Seller, no third party that is not
an affiliate of Seller has misappropriated any trade secrets that are
included in the Transferred Technology.

 



16 SECTION 3.07 _Contracts_. (a) Except for Contracts relating to Excluded Assets
or Retained Liabilities, neither Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates is a
party to or bound by any Contract that is used or held for use exclusively in,
or that arises exclusively out of, the operation or conduct of the Business
(other than (x) any Contract that is not material in relation to the
Business, taken as a whole, (y) this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and (z) Contracts entered into after the date of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 5.01) and that is:

(i) a Contract containing a covenant not to compete (other than (A) pursuant

aggregate future liability to any person (other than Seller or any of the
Seller Affiliates) in excess of $150,000 and is not terminable by Seller or
any Seller Affiliate by notice of not more than 90 days for a cost of less
than $150,000;

(iii) a Contract under which Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates has
borrowed any money from, or issued any note, bond, debenture or other

of Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates) in any such case which,
individually, is in excess of $150,000;

which, individually, is in excess of $150,000;

(v) a lease or similar Contract with any person (other than Seller or any of

more than 90 days for a cost of less than $150,000 (other than purchase
orders, sales orders and Contracts with brokers). 

(b) Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate has performed all material
obligations required to be performed by it to date under the Transferred
Contracts and is not in material breach or default thereunder and, to the

All Transferred Contracts are valid and binding, in full force and effect and
enforceable (subject, as to enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and to general equitable principles) in accordance with their terms
by Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate, except to the extent such
failures to be valid, binding, in full force and effect or enforceable would
not be material to the Business. 

SECTION 3.08 _Permits_. (a)(i) All Transferred Permits are validly held by
Seller or a Seller Affiliate, and Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate
has complied in all material respects with the terms and conditions thereof,
(ii) during the twelve months immediately preceding the date of this

Transferred Permits would reasonably be expected to be subject to suspension,

delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Acquisition, except for

Periods have been timely filed or will be timely filed and are true, complete
and correct in all material respects, (ii) all material Taxes (whether or not

been served on Seller or the applicable the Seller Affiliate), which relates
to the Business and pursuant to which a party seeks (a) more than $150,000
from Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate or (b) injunctive relief
prohibiting the consummation of the Acquisition. Neither Seller nor any of the
Seller Affiliates is a party or subject to or in default under any
unsatisfied Judgment applicable to the conduct of the Business, other than for
such Judgments that are not material to the Business. This Section 3.10 does
not relate to intellectual property matters, Tax matters or environmental

taken any action that, if taken after the date hereof, would constitute a
breach of Section 5.01(a)(i) through (xi). Purchaser acknowledges that there
may be disruption to the Business as a result of the announcement by Seller of
its intention to sell the Business (and that there may be further disruption
to the Business as a result of the execution of this Agreement (including as
a result of the identity of Purchaser) and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby), and Purchaser agrees that any such
disruptions do not and shall not constitute a breach of this Section 3.11.

SECTION 3.12 _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. To the knowledge of Seller,
other than in respect of the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities, the
Business is in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws,
including all Applicable Laws relating to protection of the environment ("
_Environmental Laws_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, other than in
respect of the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities, there are no
pending Proceedings against Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates alleging
that the Business is in violation of any Environmental Law and neither Seller
nor any of the Seller Affiliates have received any written notice from a

which are the subject of Section 3.09.

the Transitional Services Agreement and the Manufacturing Agreement and
assuming that Purchaser has the ability to provide to the Business all
division and corporate-level services of the type currently provided to the
Business by Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates or their respective
affiliates, the Transferred Assets are sufficient to permit Purchaser
to manufacture and sell the Products in a manner substantially consistent
with the manner in which the Products have been manufactured and sold by
Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliates prior to the Closing, except for
the Excluded Assets. 

SECTION 3.14 _Transferred Equipment_. The Transferred Equipment is in

each case during the 12-month period ended March 31, 2013. Since December 31,
2012, to the knowledge of Seller, neither Seller nor any Seller Affiliate has
received any written notice of termination or intent to terminate from any
customer or supplier listed on Section 3.17 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Seller, neither Seller
nor any Seller Affiliate has agreed with any existing customer to materially
repurchase, or issue a credit or allow a return in respect of, any Products
following the Closing Date, except to the extent such Products fail to meet
specifications and other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice.

ARTICLE IV

_Representations and Warranties of Purchaser_

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ ") delivered by Purchaser to Seller on or
prior to the date hereof and the documents attached to or incorporated by
reference therein, Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Seller as
follows:

 

SECTION 4.01 _Organization and Standing_. Purchaser is validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and
has full corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to
enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted, other than such franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the Acquisition or otherwise comply with the terms of
this Agreement (a " _Purchaser Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 

SECTION 4.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Purchaser
has full corporate power and authority to execute this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be, a party and to
consummate the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Purchaser has taken all corporate action required by
its organizational documents to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be,
a party and to authorize the consummation of the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



20  Purchaser has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and prior to the
Closing will have duly executed and delivered each Ancillary Agreement to
which it is, or is specified to be, a party, and this Agreement constitutes,
and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, a party
will after the Closing constitute, its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms subject, as to
enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization
or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and to general equitable
principles.

 

SECTION 4.03 _No Conflicts or Violations; No Consents or Approvals Required_.
The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement do not, the
execution and delivery by Purchaser of each Ancillary Agreement to which it
is, or is specified to be, a party will not, and the consummation of the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
will not, conflict with, or result in any breach of or constitute a default
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of Purchaser, or any of its subsidiaries under, any provision of (i)
the organizational documents of Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries, (ii)
any Contract to which Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of its properties or assets is bound or (iii) any Judgment or
Applicable Law applicable to Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or its
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, any such items that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. No Consent of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained
or made by or with respect to Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
or the consummation of the Acquisition other than (A) compliance with and
filings under the HSR Act, (B) the filings and receipt, termination or
expiration, as applicable, of such other approvals or waiting periods as may
be required under any other applicable competition, merger control, antitrust
or similar Applicable Law of any jurisdiction, (C) compliance with and filings
and notifications under applicable Environmental Laws, (D) compliance with and
filings under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, (E) those that may be
required solely by reason of Sellers (as opposed to any third partys)
participation in the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements and (F) those the failure of which to
obtain or make would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.04 _Proceedings_. There are not any (a) outstanding Judgments
against Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries, (b) Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries or (c) investigations by any Governmental Entity that are pending
or threatened against Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries that, in any such
case, would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect.

SECTION 4.05 _Availability of Funds; Solvency_. (a) Purchaser has previously
delivered to Seller a true, correct and complete copy of the Debt Commitment
Letter for the financing of the Purchase Price and the payment of the costs
and expenses of Purchaser in consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter has
been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and is a legal valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser and the other parties thereto in full force and
effect, and Purchaser has paid all fees and expenses required thereby or in
connection therewith to the extent required to be paid on or prior to the date
hereof and in the future shall pay any such fees as they

 



21  become due. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified in any respect, except, in each case, with the prior
written consent of Seller, and the financing commitments thereunder have not
been withdrawn or terminated. No event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Purchaser or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any other parties
thereto, under the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser does not have any reason
to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing (including any
conditions to the Debt Financing that relate to conditions precedent,
representations and warranties, covenants or events of default under any
other debt agreements of Purchaser) will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be available to Purchaser on a timely basis to consummate
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements

(b) As of the Closing and immediately after consummating the Acquisition and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser will not (i)
be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of
its debts is greater than the fair value of its assets or because the present
fair salable value of its assets will be less than the amount required to pay
its probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured), (ii)
have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business,
including the Business, or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur debts beyond
its ability to repay such debts as they become absolute and matured.

ARTICLE V

_Covenants_

 

SECTION 5.01 _Covenants Relating to Conduct of the Business_. (a) Except for
matters (x) set forth in Section 5.01 of the Disclosure Schedule, (y)
expressly agreed to by Purchaser (which agreement shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) or (z) otherwise contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller shall,
and shall cause the Seller Affiliates to, conduct the Business in all material
respects in the ordinary course in a manner substantially consistent with past
practice and, to the extent consistent therewith, use commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve the material business relationships with customers,
suppliers, distributors and others with whom Seller and the Seller Affiliates
deal with in connection with the conduct of the Business in the ordinary
course of business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that relationships with Seller, the Seller Affiliates and certain of
their respective affiliates providing services to the Business will terminate
as of the Closing as contemplated in Section 10.03 and that such termination
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. In addition, except as set
forth in Section 5.01 of the Disclosure Schedule, except with respect to
matters as to which Purchaser shall have no obligations, liabilities and
commitments after the Closing and except as otherwise contemplated by the
terms of this Agreement, Seller shall not, and shall not cause any of the
Seller Affiliates to, do any of the following in connection with the Business
without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed):

(i) incur or assume any liabilities, obligations or indebtedness for borrowed
money exclusively of the Business or guarantee any such liabilities,
obligations or indebtedness, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice;

 



22 (ii) subject any of the Transferred Assets to any Lien (other than
Permitted Liens) of any nature whatsoever;

(iii) cancel, waive, release or assign any material rights or claims
that relate exclusively to the Business, or permit any such right or claim to
lapse;

accelerate the collection of accounts receivable or intercompany receivables
of the Business, or write down the value of any Transferred Asset or write off
as uncollectible any accounts or notes receivable of the Business, in each
case, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice;

(v) make any change in any method of accounting or accounting principles,
practice or policy (or change any annual accounting period) that is
exclusively applicable to the Business other than those required by
International Financial Reporting Standards or required by Applicable Law;

(vi) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any Transferred Asset that
is material to the Business, except (A) Inventory and obsolete or excess
Equipment sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, (B) any Excluded Asset described in Section 1.02(b) and
(C) leases entered into in the ordinary course of business with aggregate
lease payments not in excess of $150,000 per annum;

 

(vii) only to the extent such actions would relate exclusively to the
Transferred Assets, make or rescind any election relating to Taxes or adopt
or change any method of accounting in respect of Taxes, in each case that
would materially increase Purchasers Taxes in a Post-Closing Tax Period;

 

(viii) initiate, settle or compromise any Proceeding relating primarily to the
Business (whether or not commenced prior to the date of this Agreement),
other than settlements or compromises for Proceedings set forth on Section
3.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule on solely monetary terms where the
amount paid in settlement or compromise does not exceed $150,000 in the
aggregate;

(ix) grant or permit allowances or discounts on the Products, other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

(x) other than in the ordinary course of business, with respect to any
Contract described in any of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section
3.07(a), (A) enter into a new agreement or Contract that would have been
required to be listed on Section 3.07 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule if it
had been entered into as of the date of this Agreement, or (B) amend, waive
any rights under, modify or terminate any such agreement or any agreement or
Contract listed on Section 3.07 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; or

(xi) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of the foregoing.

 



23 SECTION 5.02 _Access to Information_. Seller shall, and shall cause the
Seller Affiliates to, afford to Purchaser and its accountants, counsel and
other representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing, to (i) personnel
engaged in the conduct of the Business and (ii) properties, books, Contracts,
commitments and records relating exclusively to the Business (other than the
Excluded Assets), including Product cost sheets, price lists and Product lists
by SKU and location;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case such access
does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Seller or any of the
Seller Affiliates or the Business and does not include any sampling, testing
or other intrusive environmental investigation. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.02 shall obligate Seller, any of the Seller Affiliates or any of
their respective affiliates to breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any
person whether such duty arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise.

SECTION 5.03 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that the information
being provided to it in connection with the Acquisition and the consummation
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between
Purchaser and Seller (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to
information relating solely to the Business (other than the Excluded Assets
and the personnel engaged in the conduct of the Business); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other information
provided to it by Seller or Sellers representatives concerning Seller, the
Seller Affiliates and their respective affiliates shall remain subject to the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing until
the expiration or termination thereof in accordance with its terms.

SECTION 5.04 _Best Efforts_. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its best efforts to
cause the Closing to occur, including taking all actions necessary to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its
affiliates with respect to the Closing. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall
not, and shall not permit any of their respective affiliates to, take any
actions that would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in any of
the conditions set forth in Article VI not being satisfied.

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than five (5) business days following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, (i) file or cause to be filed with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form required for the
transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) make such other filings
as are necessary in other jurisdictions in order to comply with all
Applicable Laws relating to competition and shall promptly provide any
supplemental information requested by applicable Governmental Entities
relating thereto. Any such filing, notification and report form and
supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall furnish to the other such necessary 

 



24  information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall keep
each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and
any other applicable Governmental Entity and shall comply promptly with any
such inquiry or request and shall promptly provide any supplemental
information requested in connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant
to the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Any such supplemental information
shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or
such other Applicable Law. Each party shall use its best efforts to obtain any
clearance required under the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes
of this Section 5.04, the "best efforts" of Purchaser shall include promptly
(i) opposing any motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunction against the Acquisition or any portion thereof and (ii) proposing,
negotiating, offering to commit and effecting by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Purchaser or, effective as of the Closing, such assets of the
Business, or otherwise offering to take or committing to take any action which
Purchaser is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, taking or
committing to take such action that limits Purchasers freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or
assets of Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or any assets of the Business,
in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing
beyond the Outside Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall take any
and all actions necessary to ensure that (x) no requirement of or waiver,
consent or approval of the FTC, the DOJ, any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity, (y) no Judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order
or any other order in any Proceeding and (z) no other matter relating to any
antitrust or competition law or regulation, would preclude consummation of the
Acquisition by the Outside Date.

 

SECTION 5.05 _Non-Competition_. (a) Except as expressly provided herein, in
the Manufacturing Agreement or in the Transitional Services Agreement, for a
period of two years from and after the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_
"), Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, engage in the business of manufacturing, marketing,
distributing or selling salad dressing products for sale in retail channels in
the United States or in Canada (the " _Competing Activities_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , Seller and its affiliates may own or acquire, directly or
indirectly, (i) the securities of any person that engages in any of the
Competing Activities if Seller and its affiliates do not, directly or
indirectly, own more than 20% of the aggregate outstanding equity
securities of such person and (ii) any person that engages in any of the
Competing Activities if such Competing Activities account for less than 20% of
the consolidated annual revenues or assets of such person.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.05(a) to the contrary, none of
Seller and any of its affiliates shall be prevented from (i) engaging in or
having an ownership interest in any business that engages in the business of
manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling salad dressing products,
marinades or dips for sale in foodservice channels, (ii) engaging in or
having an ownership interest in any business which it currently engages in or
has an ownership interest in (including any such business that manufactures,
markets, distribute or sells salad 

 



25  dressing products, marinades or dips), including (x) any reasonable
extension or development of such business and (y) any geographical expansion
of such business, (iii) engaging in or having an ownership interest in any
business that supplies goods or services primarily to Seller or its affiliates
and (iv) treating the provisions of Section 5.05(a) as having terminated at
the time and to the extent none of Purchaser and its subsidiaries continues
to conduct in any material respect any aspect of the Business. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, during the Restricted Period, clause (ii) of this Section
5.05(b) shall not be deemed to permit the manufacturing, marketing,
distribution or selling of salad dressing products, marinades or dips for sale
by Seller or any Seller Affiliate in retail channels in the United States or
Canada; _provided_ , _however_ , the parties hereby acknowledge (A) that de
minimis quantities of salad dressing products, marinades or dips sold by
Seller outside of the United States and Canada may be resold, marketed or
distributed by third parties within either such country and (B) that
Seller shall not have any liability to Purchaser whatsoever in connection
with or as a result of any such third party actions.

 

SECTION 5.06 _Brokers or Finders_. Each of Purchaser and Seller represents, as
to itself and its affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker or
other firm or person is or will be entitled to any brokers, finders fee, fee
for financial advisory services or any other commission or similar fee in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, except, as to Seller and its affiliates, Goldman, Sachs
and Co., whose fees and expenses will be paid by Seller and, as to Purchaser and
its affiliates, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, whose
fees and expenses will be paid by Purchaser.

SECTION 5.07 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser agrees that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of
its other obligations under this Agreement that Purchaser obtain financing
for the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser has furnished Seller with
a true and correct copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter, dated as of
the date hereof, between Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated
and Bank of America, N.A. (together with any other persons added as parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms thereof and this
Agreement, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ") and excerpts of those portions
of each executed fee letter and engagement letter associated therewith that
contain any conditions to funding or "flex" provisions or other provisions
(excluding provisions related solely to fees and economic terms (other
than covenants) agreed to by the parties) regarding the terms and conditions
of the financing to be provided by such commitment letter (such commitment
letter, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto and
each such fee letter and engagement letter, collectively, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter is not subject to any
conditions or other contractual contingencies other than as set forth therein
and is binding and, on the date hereof, in full force and effect. All
commitments and other fees required to be paid under the Debt Commitment
Letter prior to the date hereof have been paid, and as of the date hereof,
Purchaser has no knowledge of any fact or occurrence existing on the date
hereof that makes any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective. Assuming no breach or
default by Seller under this Agreement and based upon facts and events known
by Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser is not aware of the
existence of any fact or event as of the date of this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to cause such conditions to funding (including any
such conditions that relate to conditions precedent, representations and
warranties, covenants or events of default under any other debt agreements of
Purchaser) not to be satisfied.

 



26 (b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law,
and to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such
instruments and documents as may be required, to arrange the Debt Financing
as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms (including the "market
flex" provisions) and subject only to the conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (x) on the terms (including the
"market flex" provisions) and subject only to the conditions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter or (y) on other terms that (1) do not contain any
additional or modified conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the
Debt Financing than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement, (2) are in a form that is otherwise not reasonably
likely to impair or materially delay the funding of the Debt Financing or the
Closing and (3) do not reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, unless
in the case of this clause (3), replaced with an amount of new financing on
conditions no less favorable to Seller than the terms set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter for the Debt Financing as of the date of this
Agreement, (ii) satisfy, and cause its affiliates to satisfy, on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser or its affiliates contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter and (iii) consummate the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing, which
efforts to consummate the Debt Financing may include the taking of enforcement
action to cause the Debt Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing if the
conditions to such Debt Financing are satisfied. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its affiliates to, refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any
action that is reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or in any definitive
agreement related to the Debt Financing. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.07, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the
Debt Financing, the availability of any replacement commitments or receipt of
the proceeds therefrom. 

(c) Purchaser shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Commitment Letter
without Sellers prior written consent, except that Purchaser may amend,
supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment,
supplement or other modification (i) does not contain additional or modified
conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing
relative to those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and (ii) is otherwise not reasonably likely to impair
or materially delay the funding of the Debt Financing or the Closing (it being
understood that, subject to the requirements of this clause (c), such
amendment, supplement or other modification of the Debt Commitment Letter may
provide for the assignment of a portion of the financing commitment to
additional agents or arrangers and grant such persons approval rights with
respect to certain matters as are customarily granted to additional agents or
arrangers).

 



27 (d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
(including the "market flex" provisions) and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller, and Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, replacement commitments on terms that
will enable Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that are not less favorable in the aggregate to Seller than
those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter;  _provided_ that such
replacement commitments shall not (i) be subject to any additional or modified
conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing than
those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of
this Agreement or (ii) otherwise be reasonably likely to impair or materially
delay the funding of the Debt Financing or the Closing. Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller complete and correct copies of all amendments,
supplements, other modifications or agreements pursuant to which any amended,
supplemented, modified or replacement commitments provide Purchaser with any
portion of the Debt Financing; _provided_ that Purchaser may redact from any
such copies the fee amounts payable to the Debt Financing Sources. Purchaser
shall keep Seller informed on a timely basis of the status of the Debt
Financing and any material developments relating to the Debt Financing.

 

SECTION 5.08 _Financial Information Cooperation_. From and after the Closing
Date ( _provided_ that Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to begin
compliance with this covenant as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement) until the date that is 75 calendar days after the Closing Date,
Seller shall cooperate reasonably with Purchaser in the preparation,
review and audit of financial statements and other financial information
regarding the Business that are required to be included in the financial
reports and other public disclosures of Purchaser pursuant to Regulations S-X
and S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
Exchange Act in connection with the Acquisition. Such cooperation shall
include assistance with the preparation of financial statements and all other
financial information necessary for the accounting firm responsible for
reviewing and auditing such financial statements to perform its review and
audit, including the execution and delivery of a reasonable and customary
representation letter to such accounting firm (if and to the extent
reasonably required by such accounting firm). The accounting firm responsible
for the review and audit of such financial statements shall be
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP unless otherwise determined by Purchaser. All costs
and expenses incurred by Seller and its affiliates in connection with this
Section 5.08 shall be paid by Purchaser.

ARTICLE VIII __

SECTION 8.01 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 8.04, from and after the Closing, Seller shall be liable for and
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and each of its affiliates
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
agents and representatives (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against
any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, obligations or expenses
including reasonable third-party legal fees and expenses (collectively, "
_Losses_ "), suffered or incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee (without
duplication for any Loss for which indemnification may be provided under more
than one provision of this Section 8.01) to the extent arising or resulting
from any of the following:

 

(i) any breach as of the Closing Date of any representation or warranty of
Seller contained in this Agreement, without giving effect, solely for
purposes of determining the amount of any Losses associated therewith (and
not, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining if such a breach
has occurred), to any materiality or Business Material Adverse
Effect qualifier contained therein;

 



31 (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in
this Agreement;

(iii) any Retained Liability; and

 

(iv) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Seller or any
Seller Affiliate to any agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or
person retained or employed by it in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 8.02 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.04, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and each of its affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnitee (without duplication
for any Loss for which indemnification may be provided under more than one
provision of this Section 8.02) to the extent arising or resulting from any of
the following:

 

(i) any breach as of the Closing Date of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement, without giving effect, solely for
purposes of determining the amount of any Losses associated therewith (and
not, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining if such a breach
has occurred), to any materiality or Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect qualifier contained therein;

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;

(iii) any Assumed Liability; and

 

(iv) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Purchaser or its
affiliates to any agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person
retained or employed by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.03 _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) _Procedures Relating to
Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. If any party (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") receives written notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of
any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought under Section
8.01 or 8.02 (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and such Indemnified Party intends
to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly provide the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with written
notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount
thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant notices and
documents (including court papers) evidencing such Third Party Claim and the
basis for indemnification sought and otherwise in reasonable detail;
_provided_ that the failure of the

 



32  Indemnified Party to give prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not
affect the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder expect to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of
such failure. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the defense
of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice by written notice of such assumption delivered to the Indemnified
Party within 60 days following the Indemnifying Partys receipt of written
notice of the Third Party Claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof, (ii) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-
counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Indemnifying Party) at its sole
cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it
being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party will not (A) admit to any wrongdoing or (B)
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement provides
for equitable relief, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (such written consent will not be withheld or delayed
unreasonably) and (iv) all the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof, including the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise
or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend
and that by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount
of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, which releases
the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party will not file any papers, admit any liability
with respect to, or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to or otherwise compromise or discharge the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. The
parties will act in good faith to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and
will act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or
otherwise dealing with such claims. The parties will also cooperate in any
such defense and give each other reasonable access to all
information relevant thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, whether or not the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party will not
be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement
entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying
Partys prior written consent.

(b) _Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnified Party will
promptly provide the Indemnifying Party with written notice of its discovery
of any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against
or sought to be collected from the Indemnified Party, giving rise to the
claim of indemnity pursuant hereto, with such written notice stating the
nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies
of the relevant notices and documents (including court papers) evidencing
such matter and the basis for indemnification sought and otherwise in
reasonable detail; _provided_ that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
give prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not affect the Indemnified
Partys right to indemnification hereunder expect to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
Indemnifying Party will have 60 days

 



33  from receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate and
assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for
indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters.
Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable access to
and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters,
furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of
such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

SECTION 8.04 _Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Article VIII, (i) neither party shall be liable,
pursuant to Section 8.01(i) or 8.01(ii) or Section 8.02(i) or 8.02(ii), as
applicable, unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing within the
applicable survival period, failing which such claim shall be waived and
extinguished, (ii) neither party shall be liable, pursuant to Section 8.01(i)
or 8.01(ii) or Section 8.02(i) or 8.02(ii), as applicable (other than in
connection with the breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation by Seller or
the breach of a Purchaser Fundamental Representation by Purchaser, or in the
case of fraud) for (x) any Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party unless the
aggregate of all such Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party exceeds, on a
cumulative basis, an amount equal to $11,600,000, and then only to the extent
of any such excess, or (y) any individual items where the Loss relating
thereto is less than $25,000 and such items shall not be aggregated for
purposes of the immediately preceding clause (x), (iii) the aggregate
liability of a party hereunder, pursuant to Section 8.01(i) or 8.01(ii) or
Section 8.02(i) or 8.02(ii), as applicable, for Losses suffered by an
Indemnified Party (other than in connection with the breach of a Seller
Fundamental Representation by Seller or the breach of a Purchaser Fundamental
Representation by Purchaser, or in the case of fraud) shall in no event exceed
$87,000,000, (iv) the aggregate liability of a party hereunder, pursuant to
Section 8.01(i) or 8.01(ii) or Section 8.02(i) or 8.02(ii), as applicable,
for Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party shall in no event exceed the
Purchase Price, and (v) neither party hereto shall be liable to the other for
indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages claimed by
such other party resulting from such first partys breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder. In no event shall any
party be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party or any other person with
respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was taken into account in
the calculation of the adjustment to the Closing Date Payment, if any,
pursuant to Section 2.03(c). The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement and in any document delivered in
connection herewith shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this
Article VIII as follows: (1) the representations and warranties in Articles
III (other than the Seller Fundamental Representations) and IV (other than
the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) shall survive for eighteen months
following the Closing, (2) the Seller Fundamental Representations and the
Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, (3) the representations and warranties
in Section 3.09 shall survive until the 60th day following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, (4) the covenant in Section 5.02 shall
not survive the Closing and (5) the other covenants set forth herein shall
survive the Closing pursuant to the terms thereof. " _Seller Fundamental
Representations_ " shall mean the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.01 (entitled "Organization and Standing"), 3.02 (entitled
"Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability"), 3.05 (entitled "Good and
Valid Title") and 3.06(a) (entitled "Intellectual Property"). " _Purchaser
Fundamental Representations_ " shall mean the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 4.01 (entitled "Organization and Standing"), 4.02
(entitled "Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability") and 4.05
(entitled "Availability of Funds; Solvency").

 



34 (b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by acting in good faith to
mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. In the event that Purchaser
or Seller shall fail to make such good faith efforts to mitigate or resolve
any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless any person for any claims, losses, damages, liabilities,
obligations or expenses that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided
if Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, (i) other than the representations
and warranties of Seller specifically contained in Article III of this
Agreement, none of Seller, any of its affiliates or any other person has made
any representation or warranty either expressed or implied (A) with respect to
the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements or (B) as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Business, the
Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements furnished or made available to
Purchaser and its representatives, (ii) Purchaser has not relied on any
representation or warranty from Seller, any Seller Affiliate or any other
person in determining to enter into this Agreement, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (iii) Purchaser
shall have no claim or right to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII

arising from, fraud or (iii) claims for injunctive relief or other equitable
relief, solely with respect to Section 5.05 and Section 11.13) Purchaser or

provincial, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation,
common law or otherwise (including with respect to environmental matters
generally and any matters under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act) (except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article VIII).

SECTION 8.05 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_. The amount of any Loss for

affirmative obligation to seek recovery under any insurance policies.

SECTION 8.06 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and Seller agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective
affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price unless a final determination by the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") (which determination shall

applicable Taxing Authority provides otherwise.

 _Tax Matters_

SECTION 9.01 _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. In the case of any Straddle
Period, (a) Property Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to
the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the
Straddle Period that is in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and shall be a
Retained Liability, and (b) Property Taxes for the Post-Closing Tax Period
shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days during the Straddle Period that is in the Post-Closing Tax Period and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period,
and shall be an Assumed Liability. The party that has the primary obligation
to do so under Applicable Law shall file any Tax Return that is required to
be filed in respect of Taxes described in this Section 9.01, and such party
shall pay the Taxes shown on such Tax Return. To the extent any such Taxes
paid by Purchaser (or any refund of Taxes received by Purchaser) is allocable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, or any such Taxes paid by Seller (or any refund
of Taxes received by Seller) is allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period,
Purchaser or Seller (as applicable) shall pay to the other party such
proportionate amount promptly after the payment of such Taxes (or the receipt
of any such refund).

 



36 SECTION 9.02 _Tax Matters_. (a) At least fourteen (14) calendar days prior
to the Closing Date, in consultation with Seller, Purchaser shall provide
Seller with an estimate of the allocation of the total consideration
(including liabilities assumed) among the Transferred Assets on a separate
basis for each of Seller and each of the Seller Affiliates in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law, as applicable. If Seller does not agree with such estimate, Seller and
Purchaser will negotiate in good faith to determine the allocation to be used
for purposes of the Closing.

(b) Without regard to the estimate determined pursuant to Section 9.02(a),
within 60 calendar days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall provide Seller a proposed allocation (the " _Allocation_ ")
prepared on a separate basis and for each of Seller and each of the Seller
Affiliates, and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law, as applicable, of the total
consideration (including liabilities assumed) among the Transferred Assets.
The Allocation shall become final and binding 20 calendar days after
Purchaser provides the Allocation to Seller, unless Seller objects in good
faith. In that case, the parties will attempt in good faith to agree upon the
Allocation. If the parties cannot agree on the Allocation, each party hereto
shall use its own allocation, as each such party shall deem appropriate.

 

(c) Any adjustments to the Final Purchase Price shall be allocated in
accordance with the agreement reached as set forth in Section 9.02(b).

(d) Seller (and its affiliates) and Purchaser (and its affiliates) agree to
file all Tax Returns consistent with the final versions of the allocations,
if any, and forms described in this Section 9.02.

SECTION 9.03  _Transfer Taxes_. (a) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in
timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in
connection with the payment of Transfer Taxes. The party responsible for
paying any Transfer Taxes will cause such Transfer Taxes to be timely paid to
the applicable Taxing Authority. Seller and Purchaser, as appropriate shall
execute and deliver, and Seller shall cause each of the Seller Affiliates, as
appropriate, to execute and deliver, all instruments and certificates
reasonably necessary to enable the other to comply with any filing
requirements relating to any such Transfer Taxes.

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall share equally all Transfer Taxes. Each of the
Seller and Purchaser shall use, and Seller shall cause each of the Seller
Affiliates to use, reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available
exemptions from or refunds of any such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with
the other parties in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemption or refund.

 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.03(b), Purchaser shall pay or pay over to Seller
any Canadian Federal Goods and Services Tax imposed pursuant to Part IX of
the Excise Tax Act (Canada) (" _GST_ "), Harmonized Sales Tax imposed pursuant
to Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) (" _HST_ ") and Quebec Sales Tax
imposed pursuant to the Act respecting the Quebec

 



37  sales tax (Quebec) (" _QST_ ") imposed on the transfer of the Transferred
Assets (GST, HST and QST together, the " _Canadian Taxes_ ") to a Canadian
subsidiary that is an affiliate of Purchaser. In the event that Purchaser
reasonably determines that it cannot recover, as refunds or as a direct offset
to a Tax liability, all or a portion of the Canadian Taxes from the
appropriate Taxing Authority, Seller shall pay to Purchaser 50% of the
Canadian Taxes that Purchaser cannot recover. If, subsequent to Seller paying
to Purchaser an amount pursuant to this Section 9.03(c), Purchaser obtains a
recovery of the Canadian Taxes from the appropriate Taxing Authority,
Purchaser shall repay 50% of the recovered amounts to Seller. The affiliate of
Purchaser that is purchasing the Canadian Transferred Assets hereunder shall
provide, if applicable, its GST/HST and QST registration numbers to Seller on
or prior to the Closing.

(d) Purchaser and Seller agree to provide each other with such information and
assistance as is reasonably necessary, including access to records and
personnel, for the preparation of any Tax Returns or for the defense of any
Tax claim or assessment, whether in connection with an audit or otherwise.

such other party and its affiliates; _provided_ , _however_  that such access

statutorily or otherwise.

and whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise), including
any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof, shall be brought exclusively in a Federal court

located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and hereby
irrevocably accepts and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the aforesaid courts _in personam_ , with respect to any such action, suit
or proceeding. Each of Purchaser and Seller irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, New York County, or (ii) any Federal court sitting in the State of New

in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
disputes relating hereto, including in any action, claim, suit or proceeding
against any Debt Financing Source. Each party (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by,
