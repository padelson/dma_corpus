Net Book Value, the amount by which the Estimated Net Book Value exceeds the
Adjusted September Balance Sheet Net Book Value, which amount shall be added

>>      _

>> 1. Allocation of Purchase Price_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Closing Purchase Price, as adjusted as

Purchase Price paid by each Purchaser for the Assets, other than with respect
to (x) the GmbH Shares, which shall be the GmbH Purchase Price, and (y) the
assets and liabilities of Pioneer Canada, which shall be the Canadian Purchase
Price. Each party hereto agrees (i) that any such allocation shall be
consistent with paragraph (a) above and the requirements of Section 1060 of
the Code and the regulations thereunder, (ii) to complete jointly and to file
separately Form 8594 with its Federal income Tax Return consistent with such
allocation for the tax year in which the Closing Date occurs and (iii) that no
party will take a position on any income, transfer or gains Tax Return, before
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority charged with the collection of any
such Tax or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any manner inconsistent
with the terms of any such allocation without the consent of the other party.

sheet with respect to the Net Book Value (the " _Pre-Closing Balance Sheet_ ")

the Closing Date, (2) contain the same line item categories as those contained
in the form of the balance sheet attached in _Annex A_ hereto and the balance
sheet dated September 30, 2002 (other than the line item "Investments"), which
has been previously provided by Sellers to Purchasers and is attached hereto
as _Section 1.04(c)(i)(A)(i)(2) of the Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _September
Balance Sheet_ "), (3) be prepared from the Business Books and Records and in
accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time, applied on a basis
consistent with the Financial Statements, _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared
in accordance with the valuation principles set forth in _Annex A_ hereto
(together, the " _Accounting Principles_ "), and (4) reflect no write-up of
any individual asset of the Business which was included in the Financial
Statements and is included in the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet to a book value
greater than its book value in the Financial Statements, and (ii) a
certificate of Sellers (the " _Pre-Closing Certificate_ ") setting forth
thereon Sellers\' good faith estimate of the Net Book Value as of the Closing
Date (the " _Estimated Net Book Value_ "), which shall be derived from and
supported by the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet.

the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Purchasers an audited
balance sheet of the Net Book Value as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Date Balance Sheet_ "), together with a certificate of Sellers (the " _Closing
Date Certificate_ "), which shall set forth the Net Book Value as of the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Net Book Value_ ") as derived from and
supported by the Closing Date Balance Sheet. Sellers and Purchasers shall
split equally the expenses incurred by Sellers in the preparation of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet. As part of the preparation of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, Purchasers shall have the right to jointly conduct with Sellers
a complete physical inventory of the Business as of the Closing Date and the
results thereof shall be reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The
Closing Date Balance Sheet shall (i) contain the same line item categories as
those contained in the form of the balance sheet attached in _Annex A_ hereto,
the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the September Balance Sheet and (ii) be
prepared from the Business Books and Records and in accordance with the
Accounting Principles used in the preparation of the Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet. Purchasers and their independent public accountant (" _Purchasers\'
Accountant_ ") may participate and observe the preparation of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet. Sellers and their independent public accountant (" _Sellers\'
Accountant_ ") shall make all of their work papers and other relevant
documents in connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
available to Purchasers and Purchasers\' Accountant, and shall make the
persons in charge of the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
available for reasonable inquiry by Purchasers and Purchasers\' Accountant.

and in no event more than 30 days, following receipt of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Certificate if they do not agree with the
Closing Date Net Book Value set forth thereon, in which case Purchasers and
Purchasers\' Accountant, on the one hand, and Sellers and Sellers\'
Accountant, on the other, will use good faith efforts during the thirty (30)
day period following the date Sellers received such notice from Purchasers to
resolve any differences they may have as to the Closing Date Net Book Value.
Such written notice will identify with reasonable specificity the calculations
with which Purchasers disagree or other bases for such disagreement. If
Sellers and Purchasers cannot reach agreement during such thirty (30) day
period, they shall submit their disagreements within fifteen (15) days after
the expiration of such thirty (30) day period to an independent, nationally-
recognized public accounting firm jointly selected by Sellers\' Accountant and
Purchasers\' Accountant (the " _Independent Accountant_ "), which shall
conduct such additional review as is necessary to resolve the specific
disagreements referred to it and, based thereon, shall determine the Closing
Date Net Book Value. The review of the Independent Accountant will be
restricted as to scope to address only those matters as to which Sellers and
Purchasers have not reached agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence. The
Independent Accountant\'s determination of the Closing Date Net Book Value,
which shall be completed as promptly as practicable but in no event later than
thirty (30) days following its selection, shall be confirmed by the
Independent Accountant in writing to, and shall be final and binding on, each
of Sellers and Purchasers for all purposes.

accordance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this _Section 1.04(c)_, as the
case may be (the " _Final Net Book Value_ ") is less than the Estimated Net
Book Value (such difference being herein referred to as the " _Net Worth
Deficiency_ "), then Sellers shall, within three (3) Business Days following
the date of determination of the Final Net Book Value (the " _Determination
Date_ "), pay to Purchasers, if the amount of the Net Worth Deficiency exceeds
the Holdback Amount, such excess amount and Purchasers shall retain the
Holdback Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the amount of the Net Worth
Deficiency is less than the Holdback Amount, Purchasers shall, within three
(3) Business Days following the Determination Date, pay to Sellers, the amount
equal to the Holdback Amount less the Net Worth Deficiency. In the event that
the Final Net Book Value is greater than the Estimated Net Book Value (such
difference being herein referred to as the " _Net Worth Excess_ "), Purchasers
shall, within three (3) Business Days following the Determination Date, pay to
Sellers the amount equal to the sum of the Net Worth Excess and the Holdback
Amount. If the Final Net Book Value is equal to the Estimated Net Book Value,
Purchasers shall, within three (3) Business Days following the Determination
Date, pay to Sellers the Holdback Amount.

year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable and the
principal amount of the Holdback Amount shall be payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account as Sellers may direct by written
notice delivered to Purchasers.

Accountant is closer to the Closing Date Net Book Value advocated by (i)
Sellers than it is to the Closing Date Net Book Value advocated by Purchasers,

Accountant for services rendered pursuant to this Section or (ii) Purchasers
than it is to the Closing Date Net Book Value advocated by Sellers, Sellers
shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant for

then  at the subsequent closing of the sale of the GmbH Shares and/or the 
Canadian Assets (as the case may be), the parties shall apply the principals 
and adjustment mechanisms set forth in this _Section 1.04_ to the  GmbH

applicable Assumed Liabilities as and to the extent provided in _Section
1.02(a)_ (the Assumption Agreement and such other instruments referred to in
clause (ii) being collectively referred to herein as the " _Assumption
Instruments_ "); and (c) if all of the WPI Necessary Approvals have been
obtained prior to the Closing, Pioneer will deliver to Arrow certificates
representing all of Pioneer\'s right, title and interest in and to the WPI
Shares, each such certificate to be duly and validly endorsed in favor of
Arrow or accompanied by a separate stock power duly and validly executed by
Pioneer with requisite stock transfer stamps, if any, and otherwise sufficient
to vest in the applicable Purchaser good and valid title in and to the WPI
Shares. At the Closing, there shall also be delivered to Sellers and
Purchasers the opinions, certificates and other contracts, documents and
instruments required to be delivered under _Articles VI_ and _VII_.

to, the Governmental or Regulatory Authorities specified in _Section 2.14(a)
of the Disclosure Schedule_, if any, necessary to vest in Arrow good and valid
title to the WPI Shares (" _WPI Necessary Approvals_ "), have not been
obtained prior to the Closing, then Pioneer and Arrow shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain all the WPI Necessary Approvals by such date that is thirty
(30) days after the Closing Date (the " _WPI Drop Dead Date_ "). If Pioneer
and Arrow are able to obtain all of the WPI Necessary Approvals by the WPI

notices  to, (i) the Cartel Office necessary to vest in Arrow Europe good and
valid title  to the GmbH Shares and/or (ii) the Competition Bureau necessary
to vest in Arrow  good and valid title to the Canadian Assets, then (A) the
parties will consummate  the Closing without acquiring the GmbH Shares and/or
(as the case may be) the  Canadian Assets and assuming the Canadian
Liabilities, (B) the Net Book Value  of the GmbH Subsidiary and/or (as the
case may be) of Pioneer Canada will be  excluded from the Pre-Closing Balance

Arrow: (1) Arrow shall pay the GmbH Purchase Price to Pioneer and (2)
Pioneer  shall deliver to Purchasers the executed Share Purchase and Transfer

shall not be obligated to purchase  the GmbH Shares or pay the GmbH Purchase
Price to Pioneer. If Pioneer and Arrow  are able to obtain all of such
approvals from the Competition Bureau by the  Drop Dead Date, then, as

to  Pioneer. If at the Closing Date the necessary approvals of the Cartel
Office  with respect to the GmbH Subsidiary and/or the Competition Office
with respect  to Pioneer Canada have not been obtained, the commencement date

Sellers setting forth the names of such terminated Employees and the amounts
actually paid by the Sellers to or on behalf of such terminated Employees,
reimburse Sellers for any severance payments actually paid by Sellers to or on
behalf of any terminated Employees pursuant to the Severance Policy as a
result of the Sellers\' termination of such Employees (x) on the day of the
Closing or at any time during the two-week period after the Closing Date, (y)
a later date to comply with the WARN ACT, or (z) with respect to any Employees
who are retained by Sellers to provide services under the Transition Services
Agreement, on the day of termination of such Employees by Sellers _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchasers shall not be obligated to reimburse Sellers for
any severance payments made to any Selected Employees who are offered
employment by Purchasers with substantially equivalent compensation and
benefits, in the aggregate, to that currently being provided by Sellers to

location that is not more than fifty (50) miles from such location, and who do
not accept the Purchasers\' offer of employment; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Purchasers shall not be obligated to reimburse Sellers for any additional
severance to any vice-presidents not required by the Severance Policy as

responsible for all employment obligations (other than severance, which shall
be addressed in the manner described in this _Section 1.06_ ) accruing or
arising with respect to such Employees during such time. Purchasers shall not
be obligated to reimburse Sellers for any such severance payments to Employees
terminated by Sellers after the time periods specified in clauses (x) through

that is not substantially equivalent in compensation and benefits, in the
aggregate, to that currently being provided by Sellers to each such Selected
Employee, or which involves a change in work location of fifty (50) or more
miles, and any such Selected Employee declines such employment, Purchasers

setting forth the names of such Selected Employees and the amounts actually
paid by Sellers to or on behalf of such Selected Employees, reimburse Sellers
for any severance payments Sellers actually pay to or on behalf of such
Selected Employees pursuant to the Severance Policy.

>>  

>>

>> (iv) Sellers hereby represent and warrant to Purchasers that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not trigger any "change of
control", as such term is defined in any employment agreement or change of
control agreement with or relating to any Employees. In the event that any
claim or demand is made in respect of which an Employee asserts against or
seeks to be collected from any of Purchasers any payments or other benefits
arising in connection with a "change of control", including, without
limitation, as a result of any court of competent jurisdiction or other
competent Governmental or Regulatory Authority determining that a "change of
control" has occurred that would trigger any payments or other benefits,
Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchasers for all costs and
expenses incurred in defending and/or paying any such claim or demand and any
Losses or Liabilities related thereto.

Employee any right to continued employment by any of Purchasers, nor shall
anything herein interfere with the right of Purchasers to terminate the

applicable law. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Employee, or any beneficiary or dependents thereof.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (vi) Sellers hereby waive, with respect to the solicitation of employment
or employment by Purchasers of any Selected Employee, any claims or rights
Sellers may have against Purchasers or any such Selected Employee under any
non-hire, non-solicitation, non-competition, confidentiality or employment
agreement or any cause of action based on similar rights arising by contract,
at common law or by statute or regulation. Sellers hereby assign, to the
extent legally permissible, to Purchasers all of Sellers\' rights to enforce
the provisions of any non-competition agreement between any of Sellers and any
Transferred Employee and any non-hire, non-solicitation, confidentiality,
assignment of inventions or similar agreement between such Sellers and any
Transferred Employee.

solicit the employment of any Transferred Employees other than through general
advertising not specifically directed at such employees, (B) hire any
Transferred Employees of Purchasers, except as a result of actions permitted
by clause (A) above, or (C) solicit, entice, induce or encourage any
Transferred Employees or any other employee, consultant or independent
contractor of Purchasers to terminate his, her or its relationship with any of
Purchasers in order to become an employee of, or a consultant or independent
contractor to, a person other than Purchasers; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Sellers shall not be restricted from soliciting the employment of or hiring
any Transferred Employees that have previously been terminated by Purchasers
or have terminated their employment with Purchasers other than as a result of
Sellers\' violation of this _Section 1.06(a)(vii)_.

10.02 _Method of Asserting Claims_.

 

All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party under _Section 10.01_
will be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under _Section 10.01_ is asserted against or sought to
be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Sellers or any
Affiliates of Sellers or of Purchasers (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim
Notice with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party\'s ability to defend has been irreparably
prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the Dispute
Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under _Section 10.01_ and whether the Indemnifying Party
desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against
such Third Party Claim.

>  
>

>>   

>>

>> (i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section
10.02(a)_, then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by
the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the
discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld in the case
of any settlement as to which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified in
full). The Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have waived its right to
dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party under _Section 10.01_ with
respect to any Third Party Claim as to which it elects to control the defense.
The Indemnifying Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified
Party, at any time prior to the Indemnifying Party\'s delivery of the notice
referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 10.02(a)(i)_, file any
motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action that is reasonably
necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnified Party\'s interests; and
_provided_ _further_ , that if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in contesting
any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to represent it in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 10.02(a)(i)_, and the
Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
separate counsel except as provided in the preceding sentence and except that
the Indemnifying Party will pay the costs and expenses of such separate
counsel if (x) in the Indemnified Party\'s good faith judgment, it is
advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be
represented by separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (y) the
named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith,
based on advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are
unavailable to the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying
Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its
right to indemnity under _Section 10.01_ with respect to such Third Party
Claim.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third
Party Claim pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_, or if the Indemnifying Party
gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the
Indemnified Party in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the
Indemnified Party (with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Party will have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if requested by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified
Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the
Indemnified Party is contesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_, if the Indemnifying Party has notified the
Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability hereunder to the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying
Party in the manner provided in clause (iii) below, the Indemnifying Party
will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified
Party\'s defense pursuant to this _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_ or of the
Indemnifying Party\'s participation therein at the Indemnified Party\'s
request, and the Indemnified Party will bear all costs and expenses and
reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation. The
Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
10.02(a)(ii)_, and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to such participation.

>>

>>  

>>

>> (iii) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does
not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third
Party Claim under _Section 10.01_ or fails to notify the Indemnified Party
within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
Loss arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party under _Section 10.01_ and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party
on demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within
the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court
of competent jurisdiction.

>
>  

  

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under _Section
10.01_  against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, the  Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with
reasonable promptness  to the Indemnifying Party. Subject to _Section 9.01_,
the failure  by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not
impair such  party\'s rights hereunder except to the extent that an
Indemnifying Party demonstrates  that it has been irreparably prejudiced
thereby. If the Indemnifying Party notifies  the Indemnified Party that it
does not dispute the claim described in such Indemnity  Notice or fails to
notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether  the
Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, 
the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice will be
conclusively  deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under _Section
10.01_  and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the
Indemnified  Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying  Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to
such claim, the Indemnifying  Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution  of such dispute, and if not resolved
through negotiations within the Resolution  Period, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in a court of competent  jurisdiction.

B) Valuation Principles

  

    

 1. Except as set forth herein, the same reserve methodology utilized in the preparation of the September Balance Sheet shall be used in the preparation of the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet, including a general reserve at the same percentage of total assets (approximately 2.6% for Accounts Receivable and approximately 1.5% for Inventory).
 

 2. NCNR or vendor obsolete Inventory without a firm customer order shall be reserved at 100%. The general reserve may be used for this exposure.
 

 3. Non-franchised Inventory without a firm customer order shall be reserved at 100%. The general reserve may be used for this exposure.
 

 4. Purchase order receipt accruals will be used solely to pay vendor trade invoices in the ordinary course of business and shall not be released to income from the September Balance Sheet (i.e. the accrued liability must appear on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet).
 

 5. All vendor net debit balances (i.e., receivables from suppliers) related to suppliers who are not Named Suppliers shall be retained by Seller and shall not be included on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Balance Sheet.
 

 6. All vendor debits over 90 days old shall be reserved at 100%.
 

 7. No Inventory reserves will be identified for the Retained Intel Volume Business (i.e. any Inventory reserves previously identified on the September Balance Sheet shall not be included on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Balance Sheet, but instead treated as general reserves).
 

 8. The Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall include the pro-rata software development costs related to Siebel software (valued at $1.9 million on the September Balance Sheet) based on the number of "seats" licensed by Purchasers to the total number of "seats" licensed by Sellers. No other software development costs shall be included on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

providers, to any  eligible employee, as Sellers and Purchasers shall
mutually agree in writing  and (B) as to Employees of Pioneer Canada,
