<P>  All claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U> will be asserted and resolved as follows:</P>
<P>(a)&#9;In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U> is asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Sellers or any Affiliates of Sellers or of Purchasers (a "<U>Third Party Claim</U>"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party.  If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent that the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend has been irreparably prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified Party.  The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U> and whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.</P><blockquote>
<blockquote>

<P>(i)&#9;If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.02(a)</U>, then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld in the case of any settlement as to which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified in full).  The Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have waived its right to dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U> with respect to any Third Party Claim as to which it elects to control the defense.  The Indemnifying Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, at any time prior to the Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice referred to in the first sentence of this <U>Section&nbsp;10.02(a)(i)</U>, file any motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action that is reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the Indemnified Party's interests; and <U>provided</U> <U>further</U>, that if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest.  The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to represent it in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.02(a)(i)</U>, and the Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such separate counsel except as provided in the preceding sentence and except that the Indemnifying Party will pay the costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (x) in the Indemnified Party's good faith judgment, it is advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to be represented by separate counsel because a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (y) the named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith, based on advice of counsel, that defenses are available to it that are unavailable to the Indemnifying Party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying Party has elected to control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U> with respect to such Third Party Claim.</P>
<P>(ii)&#9;If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;10.02(a)</U>, or if the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party (with the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).  The Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is contesting.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;10.02(a)(ii)</U>, if the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability hereunder to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party in the manner provided in clause&nbsp;(iii) below, the Indemnifying Party will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's defense pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.02(a)(ii)</U> or of the Indemnifying Party's participation therein at the Indemnified Party's request, and the Indemnified Party will bear all costs and expenses and reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation.  The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.02(a)(ii)</U>, and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.</P>
<P>(iii)&#9;If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U> or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, the Loss arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U> and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination thereof.  If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<P>(b)&#9;In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U>
  against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
  Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice with reasonable promptness
  to the Indemnifying Party. Subject to <U>Section&nbsp;9.01</U>, the failure
  by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such
  party's rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates
  that it has been irreparably prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party notifies
  the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim described in such Indemnity
  Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether
  the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice,
  the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice will be conclusively
  deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under <U>Section&nbsp;10.01</U>
  and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified
  Party on demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying
  Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying
  Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution
  of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within the Resolution
  Period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent
  jurisdiction.</P>

<OL>

<LI>Except as set forth herein, the same reserve methodology utilized in the preparation of the September Balance Sheet shall be used in the preparation of the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet, including a general reserve at the same percentage of total assets (approximately 2.6% for Accounts Receivable and approximately 1.5% for Inventory).</LI>
<LI>NCNR or vendor obsolete Inventory without a firm customer order shall be reserved at 100%.  The general reserve may be used for this exposure.</LI>
<LI>Non-franchised Inventory without a firm customer order shall be reserved at 100%.  The general reserve may be used for this exposure.</LI>
<LI>Purchase order receipt accruals will be used solely to pay vendor trade invoices in the ordinary course of business and shall not be released to income from the September Balance Sheet (i.e. the accrued liability must appear on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet).</LI>
<LI>All vendor net debit balances (i.e., receivables from suppliers) related to suppliers who are not Named Suppliers shall be retained by Seller and shall not be included on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Balance Sheet.</LI>
<LI>All vendor debits over 90 days old shall be reserved at 100%.</LI>
<LI>No Inventory reserves will be identified for the Retained Intel Volume Business (i.e. any Inventory reserves previously identified on the September Balance Sheet shall not be included on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Balance Sheet, but instead treated as general reserves).</LI>
<LI>The Pre-Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall include the pro-rata software development costs related to Siebel software (valued at $1.9 million on the September Balance Sheet) based on the number of "seats" licensed by Purchasers to the total number of "seats" licensed by Sellers.  No other software development costs shall be included on the Pre-Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Balance Sheet.</LI></OL>

<B><U><P>Eligibility</P>
</B></U><P>I.&#9;All regular full time and semi-full time employees are eligible, after the first full &#9;90 calendar days of employment.</P>
<P>II.&#9;Part-time and temporary employees are not eligible for severance pay. </P>
<B><U><P>Guidelines</P><blockquote>
<blockquote>

</B></U><P>I.&#9;Eligible employees will be paid one week for every full year of service with the company, with a minimum of two weeks severance pay. </P></blockquote>

<P>II.&#9;Severance pay is based on an employee's regular base rate.</P><blockquote>
<blockquote>

<P>III.&#9;Severance is paid on the regular payroll schedule (i.e., biweekly or monthly) through the length of the severance period.</P>
<P>IV.&#9;The company reserves the right to determine what constitutes "just cause" for termination, which may not necessarily be limited to a breach of any of the standards of conduct listed in the Employee Handbook.</P>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<B>
<P>For purposes of this Annex B, (A) the amount of such severance benefits will
  be increased to cover (i) the actual costs of medical and dental benefits provided
  to any eligible employees during the severance period and (ii) the actual cost
  of such outplacement services, provided by such outplacement providers, to any
  eligible employee, as Sellers and Purchasers shall mutually agree in writing
  and (B) as to Employees of Pioneer Canada, Purchasers shall be obligated to
  reimburse Sellers as to the above amounts and (ii) to the extent Canadian Law
  requires severance payments in excess of the above amounts, Purchasers shall
  be obligated to reimburse Sellers for only 50% of any such excess payments.
