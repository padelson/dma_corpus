iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 5, 2008 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among Cellco Partnership, a Delaware general partnership
doing business as Verizon Wireless (" _Parent_ "), AirTouch Cellular, a
California corporation doing business as Verizon Wireless (" _Buyer_ "),
Abraham Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), Alltel
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Atlantis Holdings
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Seller_ "),

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Merger Sub and the Company has
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Seller will
execute and deliver to the Company and Buyer a stockholder written consent
adopting this Agreement and approving the transactions set forth herein,
including the Merger, which stockholder consent shall constitute the required
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, by the Companys stockholders; and

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, an
Affiliate of Buyer is entering into the Debt Agreements;

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_
"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_
") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New
York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ") following
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the    satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) that is the earlier of ( _a_ )
any Business Day as may be specified by Buyer on no less than three Business
Days prior notice to the Company and ( _b_ ) the final day of the Financing
Period, or such other date or time specified by the parties in writing;
_provided_ that in no event shall the Closing Date be prior to December 12,
2008.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time; Share Issuance_. On the Closing Date (or such
other date as Buyer and the Company may agree in writing), the Company shall
execute and file the certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and other applicable Delaware Law. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later date or
time as may be agreed by Buyer and the Company in writing and specified in
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (such time as the Merger
becomes effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").
Immediately prior to, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Effective
Time, the Company shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from the
Company, for an amount equal to the aggregate consideration to be paid in
respect of Company Securities pursuant to Section 1.8 (the " _Share Purchase
Amount_ ") payable as provided in Section 1.9, one duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Company Common Stock.

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

Section 1.5 _Company Charter and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in the
Merger to read in its entirety to be the same as the certificate
of incorporation of Merger Sub, and, as so amended, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with its terms and the DGCL, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Alltel Corporation."

(b) The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended as
provided therein or in the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be Alltel Corporation.

Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.



 

2 Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 1.8 _Conversion_.

(a)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than ( _x_ ) shares
to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.8(b) and ( _y_ ) shares of Company Common
Stock held by any holder of Company Common Stock that has properly demanded
appraisal of any of its shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and not withdrawn such demand) shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest, an amount (the
" _Full Cash Amount_ ") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing ( _A_ ) (
_1_ ) the Purchase Price, _minus_ ( _2_ ) the Supplemental Retention Amount,
to the extent paid or payable at or prior to Closing, _plus_ ( _3_ ) the
aggregate exercise price of all Company Options in respect of which a payment
is required to be made pursuant to Section 1.8(c), by ( _B_ ) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Options in respect of
which a payment is required to be made pursuant to Section 1.8(c) that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company
Securities held by the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such
amount shall be calculated and payable in accordance with Section 1.11.

(b)  _Cancellation of Company Securities Owned by the Company and Parent_. At
the Effective Time, any Company Securities that are owned by the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.

(c) _Company Options_. Each Company Option issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time shall be canceled and, except in the case of any
Performance Based Option (as defined in the Option Plan), shall be converted
into the right to receive in cash, without interest, an amount equal to the
product of ( _i_ ) the excess, if any, of ( _A_ ) the Full Cash Amount over (
_B_ ) the exercise price payable by the holder of such Company Option for a
share of Company Common Stock (regardless of whether such Company Options were
then exercisable) and ( _ii_ ) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that such amount shall be calculated and payable in accordance with
Section 1.11. For the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence
means that each Company Option with an exercise price at or above the Full
Cash Amount and each Performance Based Option shall be canceled without any
right to receive any consideration therefor. The Company shall take any and
all actions necessary to effectuate this Section 1.8(c), including adopting
any plan amendments and using its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
required consents.



 

3 (d) _Certain Adjustments_. The amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement in
respect of Company Securities shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect
of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Conversion of Merger Sub Interests_. Each of the shares of common stock
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted as of the Effective Time into and shall represent one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.9 _Closing Date Payments_. At the Closing, at the
Companys direction, Buyer shall deliver ( _i_ ) to the Exchange Agent, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Exchange Agent, for payment in accordance with Section 1.11, an amount (the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") equal to the Share Purchase Amount _minus_ the aggregate
amount payable pursuant to Section 1.8(c) in respect of Company Options and (
_ii_ ) to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by the Company, an amount equal to the aggregate amount
payable pursuant to Section 1.8(c) in respect of Company Options.

Section 1.10 _Merger Consideration Schedule_. Seller shall have sole
responsibility for allocation of the payments contemplated by this Article I
among the Company Securityholders and shall deliver to the Exchange Agent
and Buyer at the Closing a complete and correct schedule (the " _Merger
Consideration Schedule_ ") setting forth the name of and payment instructions
for each Company Securityholder and the amount payable to each Company
Securityholder pursuant to Section 1.11. Seller shall have sole
responsibility for any inaccuracies in the Merger Consideration Schedule.

Section 1.11 _Payment for Company Securities_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Securityholder shall be entitled
to receive the amount specified in Section 1.8(a) in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock owned by such holder and the amount specified in Section
1.8(c) in respect of each Company Option owned by such holder. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of Company, the proper amount of cash may
be paid to a transferee if such transferee presents to the Exchange Agent
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and
reasonable evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.



 

4 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later
than the close of business on the Closing Date), ( _i_ ) the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to each holder of Company Common Stock and ( _ii_ ) the Company
shall deliver to each holder of any Company Option, the amount to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.11(a) with respect thereto, in each
case as set forth on the Merger Consideration Schedule.

(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time, and all
certificates or other documents in possession of the Exchange Agent relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby as of the end of that period, shall
be promptly delivered to the Company, and the Exchange Agents duties shall
thereupon terminate. Thereafter, each former holder of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive from the Company, subject to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, the payments required to be made
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the Company Common Stock formerly
held by such holder, without any interest thereon, calculated in accordance
with this Agreement. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Company Common Stock as of a date that is immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Company, free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Company
Securityholder for any cash delivered to a Governmental Authority or public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(d) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to
any Company Securityholder such amounts as the Exchange Agent, Parent, Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of U.S.
federal, state or local tax law or any other non-U.S. tax law or any other
applicable legal requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Exchange Agent, Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with such requirements and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Securityholder
in respect of which such withholding was made.

Section 1.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Securities_. All cash
paid in respect of Company Securities in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Securities, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.



 

5 Section 1.13 _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. At the Closing, Buyer and Seller
shall enter into an exchange agent agreement (the " _Exchange Agreement_ ")
with an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") selected by Seller and
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. The Exchange Agreement shall not contain any
provisions that are not contemplated by this Agreement other than customary
mechanical provisions.

as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the

all requisite corporate action of the Company, other than approval of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders, which shall be obtained immediately
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Company has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Each of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). 

(b) Except as set forth on Section 2.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the

FCC (the " _FCC Rules_ "), ( _iii_ ) such filings or consents as may be
required by local and state Governmental Authorities pursuant to local or
state Laws regulating the telecommunications business, ( _iv_ ) any actions
or filings under Laws the absence of which would not constitute a Material
Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and ( _v_ ) actions or
filings that may arise solely as a result of the Financing or the status or
identity of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

Section 2.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not
and will not ( _i_ ) conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or of any order, judgment or decree applicable to any of them,
( _ii_ ) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 2.2(b),
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any
applicable Law, ( _iii_ ) require any consent of or other action by any
Person under, constitute a default or an event that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or cause or permit
the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit under, any provision of any material
agreement or other instrument (including with respect to any Intellectual
Property) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or any
License affecting the assets or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or ( _iv_ ) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of  



 

7  clauses (iii) and (iv), as would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect
and except as may arise in connection with the Financing or the status
or identity of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

Section 2.4 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 550,000,000 shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), and
50,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 454,000,122.50 shares of Company
Common Stock and no shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding. All
of the issued shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 2.4(a), and except for Company Options
that will be canceled at the Effective Time in accordance with Section 1.8(c),
there are no outstanding ( _i_ ) shares of capital stock of or other voting or
equity interests in the Company, ( _ii_ ) securities of the Company
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of
or other voting or equity interests in the Company, ( _iii_ ) options or other
rights or agreements, commitments or understandings of any kind to acquire

Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell, any capital stock of or other voting
or equity interests in the Company or securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for capital stock of or other voting or equity
interests in the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being
referred to collectively as the " _Company Equity Interests_ "), ( _iv_ )
voting trusts, proxies or other similar agreements or understandings to which

of its Subsidiaries or ( _v_ ) contractual obligations or commitments of any
character restricting the transfer of, or requiring the registration for sale

(a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation and has
all powers (corporate or otherwise) required to carry on its business as now
conducted. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which the nature of its
business or the properties owned, leased or operated by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for any failure to be so
qualified or in good standing that does not constitute a Material Adverse
Effect. The authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of and
other voting or equity interests in all Subsidiaries of the Company, their
respective jurisdictions of  



 

8  formation and the Companys direct or indirect ownership interest in such
Subsidiaries are identified in Section 2.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The Company has made available to Buyer complete copies of
the Organizational Documents of each Subsidiary of the Company as currently in
effect, and no such Subsidiary is in material violation of any provision of
its Organizational Documents.

(b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of and other voting or
equity interests in each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized
and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned beneficially
and of record by the Company or one of its wholly owned Subsidiaries as set
forth in Section 2.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, free and clear of
any Liens. Except as set forth in Section 2.5(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no outstanding ( _i_ ) shares of capital stock of or other
voting or equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company, ( _ii_ )
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of or other voting or
equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or ( _iii_ ) options

acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell, any capital
stock of or voting or equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for capital stock
of or other voting or equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company (the
items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to collectively as the "
_Subsidiary Securities_ "). There are no outstanding obligations of the

9  thereunder. As of the time of filing with the SEC, none of the Company SEC
Documents so filed or that will be filed subsequent to the date of this

of a material fact or omitted or will omit, as the case may be, to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

their cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case

none of which, in the case of any unaudited statements included in Company SEC
Documents filed after December 31, 2007, have been or will be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) and were prepared in
conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("

who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting.

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default (including
any such breach or default with respect to the payment of premiums or the
giving of notice), and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse
of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or permit termination or
modification, under any such policy. There is no claim by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pending under any such policies that ( _a_ ) has been
denied or disputed by the insurer other than denials and disputes in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or ( _b_ ) if not

the Company and its Subsidiaries as such Persons may reasonably request, (
_iii_ ) instruct the employees, counsel and financial advisors of Seller and
the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent in its investigation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and ( _iv_ ) use reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with Parent in establishing network conversion and switching
conversion arrangements and implementing other transitional arrangements and
integration plans as reasonably requested by Parent. Any investigation
pursuant to this Section 4.4(a) shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Seller or the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) After the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall hold, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers,
directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents
to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of law, all confidential
documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, except
to the extent that such information can be shown to have been ( _i_ ) in the
public domain through no fault of Seller or its Affiliates or ( _ii_ ) later
lawfully acquired by Seller on a non-confidential basis from sources other
than those related to Sellers prior ownership of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The obligation of Seller and its  



 

32  Affiliates to hold any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if
they exercise the same care with respect to such information as they would
take to preserve the confidentiality of their own similar information. After
the Closing, Seller shall not, shall cause its Affiliates not to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents
not to, use any confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries for its or their own benefit, other than as contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to the Company any
financial or other records (including accountants work papers) in
the possession of Seller that relate primarily to the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

Section 4.4 _Subsequent Financial Statements and Reports_. From the date
hereof until the Closing, the Company shall ( _i_ ) provide to Buyer a monthly
management report in scope and detail consistent with those management reports
that have been historically prepared by the Company and delivered to Seller;
_provided_ that the Company shall redact any information contained in any such
report if the disclosure of such information to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
would violate applicable Law, and ( _ii_ ) timely prepare, and promptly
deliver to Buyer, monthly financial statements, to be in scope, timing and
detail consistent with the monthly financial statements that have been
historically prepared by the Company and delivered to Seller.

Section 4.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release by each of the
parties with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent. None of the parties (or any of their
respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other parties, except
as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consult in good faith with the other parties, and give the other
parties a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon, before making any such
public announcements.

Section 4.6 _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Buyer shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain the debt financing sufficient to provide the Financing (it being
understood that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to Parents and
Buyers obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby). The
Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives, including legal
and accounting, to provide, at the expense of Buyer, all cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with obtaining debt financing for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company  



 

33  and its Subsidiaries and provided that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into any agreements in connection
therewith that would be binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if
the Closing does not occur), including using its reasonable best efforts to (
_i_ ) as promptly as practical, provide such information, including financial
information, as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection therewith,
( _ii_ ) participate in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions
in connection with such financing, ( _iii_ ) assist in the preparation of (
_A_ ) one or more offering documents or confidential information memoranda for
any aspect of such financing (including the execution and delivery of one or
more customary representation letters in connection therewith) and ( _B_ )
materials for rating agency presentations, ( _iv_ ) reasonably cooperate with
the marketing efforts for any of such financing, including providing
assistance in the preparation for, and participating in, one road show, and
in meetings, due diligence sessions and similar presentations to and with,
among others, actual or prospective arrangers, underwriters, lenders,
investors and rating agencies, ( _v_ ) ( _A_ ) permit the prospective lenders
involved in such financing to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash
management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto
for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and ( _B_ ) establish
bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing, ( _vi_ ) execute and deliver
(or use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from advisors or third
parties), and cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from advisors or third parties), one
or more credit agreements or indentures, customary certificates (including
with respect to solvency matters), representation letters, accounting comfort
letters, consents of accountants, legal opinions, hedging agreements,
appraisals, surveys, engineering reports, title insurance or other documents
and instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other
matters ancillary to such financing (it being understood that the failure to
obtain any of the foregoing from advisors or third parties, after using
reasonable best efforts, shall not be a violation of this Section 4.6),
including the pay-off of existing indebtedness and release of any related
Liens, as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with such
financing and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral and
providing of guarantees and the pay-off of existing indebtedness in
connection with such financing, ( _vii_ ) permit any cash of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to be made available to the Company at the Closing, and (
_viii_ ) incur such expenses as Buyer reasonably requests to implement the
foregoing; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to incur expenses
in connection with the foregoing in excess of $2 million in the aggregate
unless Buyer advances to the Company funds sufficient to reimburse
the Company for such expenses. The Company shall, to the extent it is aware
of any applicable developments, promptly update any information provided by it
for use in an offering document to be used in connection with any such
financing to the extent such information would otherwise contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading. The Company consents, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, to the reasonable use of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with any such financing in a manner
customary for such financing transactions.



 

34 (b) Parent shall and shall cause each of its Affiliates to perform its
respective obligations under each of the Debt Agreements in accordance with
their terms. Without the Companys prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, grant any consents, waive any material
rights (other than any condition) or remedies under any of the Debt Agreements
or modify or amend in any material respect any of the Debt Agreements. Parent
shall take all action reasonably necessary to enforce and to cause its
Affiliates to enforce their respective rights and remedies under the Debt
Agreements. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of
any material breach by any party of the Debt Agreements or any termination of
the Debt Agreements. Parent shall not assign any Debt Agreement to any Person
without the written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except that Parent may, without the Companys
consent, delegate all or any portion of its rights and obligations under any
Debt Agreement to any of its Affiliates so long as Parent is not released
therefrom. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing.

(c) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Company, their
respective Affiliates and the respective directors, officers, partners,
employees and representatives of the foregoing from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used
in connection therewith, except with respect to any information provided by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. In the event this Agreement is terminated, Buyer
shall promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Company in complying with this Section 4.6, to the extent not
previously reimbursed by Buyer (it being understood that reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses shall include any expenses that Buyer requests the Company to
incur pursuant to this Section 4.6).

Section 4.7 _Other Actions; Filings_. From the date hereof until the Closing:

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the parties and their Affiliates shall each use their reasonable
best efforts to as promptly as practicable ( _i_ ) take, or to cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby; ( _ii_ ) obtain from any Governmental
Authorities any actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents,
approvals, permits or orders required to be obtained by the Company, Parent or
any of their respective  



 

35  Affiliates in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; ( _iii_ ) make all necessary registrations and filings,
and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this
Agreement required under ( _A_ ) the HSR Act and any applicable competition,
antitrust or investment Laws of jurisdictions other than the U.S., ( _B_ )
the FCC Rules, including the Communications Act, and ( _C_ ) any other
applicable Law; _provided_ that the parties will cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of
all such filings and attachments to the non-filing party; ( _iv_ ) furnish all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; ( _v_ ) keep the other parties informed in all material respects of
any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, any Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby; ( _vi_ ) permit the other
parties to review any material communication delivered to, and consult with
the other parties in advance of any meeting or conference with, any
Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or in
connection with any proceeding by a private party relating thereto; ( _vii_ )
avoid the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or
judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and ( _viii_ ) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. To the extent practicable under the circumstances, each of the
Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any meeting or discussion
expected to address substantive matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the proposed transactions unless, to the extent
not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, it gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and observe. No party and none of its Affiliates
shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the behest of any
Governmental Authority without the consent of the other parties, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Without limiting
this Section 4.7(a), but subject to Section 4.7(b), Parent and its Affiliates
agree to take, or to cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make any and
all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate, or minimize the impact of,
each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition,
or trade regulation Law or the FCC Rules or any Law of any PUC that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible. Parent and its Affiliates agree not to enter into any
acquisition agreement or take any other action that would reasonably be
expected to prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

36 (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, ( _i_
) Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to take or
refrain from taking any action or to agree to any restriction or condition
with respect to any of their assets or operations, in each case that would
take effect prior to the Closing, or ( _ii_ ) Parent or its Affiliates to
take any actions or to agree to or otherwise become subject to any
restriction, condition or constraint with respect to any of its or their
assets, business or operations, or those of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
if such actions, restrictions, conditions or constraints would ( _x_ )
reasonably be expected (based on whether it would be more reasonable, in the
case of a divestiture of any market, to divest the operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries in such market, on the one hand, or the operations of
Parent or its Subsidiaries in such market, on the other hand) to result in
aggregate divestitures in excess of 2.4 million subscribers of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or ( _y_ ) result in
aggregate Negative Effects that would reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, or in conjunction with the aggregate Negative Effects
resulting from any required divestitures, to have a material adverse effect
on the business of Parent, the Company or the Combined Company (any actions,
restrictions, conditions or constraints or combination thereof satisfying the
standard in clause (x) or (y), a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). " _Negative
Effects_ " means the net economic effects (netting any positive economic
effects, including net after-tax proceeds that would reasonably be expected
from any divestitures, against any negative economic effects) of all actions,
restrictions, conditions or constraints required in connection with obtaining
the requisite approvals from Governmental Authorities on the value of the
assets, business or operations of Parent, the Combined Company or
the Company, as applicable. For purposes of determining whether any action,
restriction, condition or constraint, individually or in the aggregate with
any other such action, restriction, condition or constraint, meets the
standard set forth in clause (y) of the definition of Burdensome Condition, (
_A_ ) any loss of reasonably expected synergies from the transactions
contemplated hereby as a result of any such action, restriction, condition or
constraint shall be taken into account, ( _B_ ) the reasonably expected
synergies from the transactions contemplated hereby shall be taken into
account in measuring the value against which materiality is tested in
determining whether there has been a material adverse effect, ( _C_ ) in
light of the fact that the parties expect that some level of divestitures will
be required in connection with obtaining approvals from Governmental
Authorities, there shall be excluded from the determination of Negative
Effects from any divestitures of subscribers an amount equal to the lesser of
the aggregate Negative Effects from such divestitures and the Negative Effects
Threshold (as defined in Section 4.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter), and
the size and scale of the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of clause
(D) below shall be deemed reduced by one-half of the amount so excluded, and (
_D_ ) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Combined Company,
shall each be deemed to be a consolidated group of entities having the size
and scale of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties understand and agree that actions,
restrictions, conditions or constraints that would not reasonably be expected
(based on whether it would be more reasonable, in the  



 

37  case of a divestiture of any market, to divest the operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries in such market, on the one hand, or the operations of
Parent or its Subsidiaries in such market, on the other hand) to result in
aggregate divestitures in excess of 2.8 million subscribers of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall not, in and of itself, in
any event be deemed to meet the standard set forth in clause (y) of the
definition of Burdensome Condition (it being understood and agreed that
divestitures of fewer than 2.8 million subscribers in conjunction with other
required actions, restrictions, conditions and constraints may or may not
meet the standard set forth in clause (y) of the definition of Burdensome
Condition).

(c) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any
consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Buyer in accordance with the provisions of this Section
4.7.

Section 4.8 _Employee Matters_.

(a) As of the Closing, Buyer shall honor or cause to be honored, in accordance
with their terms, all incentive, bonus, individual benefit, employment,
employment termination, severance and other compensation agreements, plans and
arrangements, including the Companys change-in-control agreements and
policies and general severance and retention plans, in each case existing
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (and as may be
subsequently adopted, entered into or amended in accordance with Section 4.1),
that are between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or
former officer, director or employee thereof or for the benefit of any such
current or former officer, director or employee. From the Closing through the
first anniversary of the Closing (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall
provide to each Employee ( _i_ ) base compensation that is not less than the
base compensation paid to such Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (
_ii_ ) annual bonus opportunities no less favorable than the bonus
opportunities provided to such Employee immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided_ that any annual bonus payment paid to an Employee by Buyer shall be
reduced (but not below zero) by any amount previously paid to such Employee
in respect of such bonus for the period covered (including payments triggered
by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and ( _iii_ ) other
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the benefits provided to such Employee immediately prior to the Closing,
except that, at Buyers discretion, Buyer may instead provide to Employees
compensation or benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
compensation or benefits, as the case may be, provided as of any date of
measure to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(b) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Buyer or its Subsidiaries following the Closing and
in which  



 

38  any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who remains employed
after the Closing (the " _Employees_ ") participate (the " _Buyer Plans_ "),
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit
accrual, service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor
employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be
treated as service with Buyer and/or any applicable Subsidiary of Buyer;
_provided_ that such service shall not be recognized ( _i_ ) to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or ( _ii_ )
for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or for
purposes of any company contribution towards retiree medical. Such service
also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or evidence
of insurability requirements. Each Buyer Plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations for Employees (and their beneficiaries and covered
dependents) participating in such plan to the extent waived or not applicable
under the applicable Company Benefit Plan. The Employees shall be given
credit under the applicable Buyer Plan for amounts paid prior to the Closing
during the Buyer Plan year in which the Closing occurs under a corresponding
Company Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums for such period as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Buyer Plan.

(c) Nothing contained herein, express or implied ( _i_ ) shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, any Buyer Plan, or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, ( _ii_ ) shall alter or
limit the ability of Buyer, the Company, or any Affiliate thereof to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, any Buyer Plan, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing, ( _iii_ )
is intended to confer or shall confer upon any current or former employee any
right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason
of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of
employment, ( _iv_ ) is intended to confer or shall confer upon any individual
or any legal representative of any individual (including employees, retirees,
or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees and including
collective bargaining agents or representatives) any right as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, ( _v_ ) shall be deemed to confer upon any such
individual or legal representative any rights under or with respect to any
plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated by this Agreement,
and each such individual or legal representative shall be entitled to look
only to the express terms of any such plan, program or arrangement for his or
her rights thereunder.

(d) The Company shall cause any Company Benefit Plan providing for
the issuance or grant of any equity interest (or right with respect thereto)
to be eliminated, terminated and of no further force or effect as of the
Effective Time.

(e) To the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, the Company shall cooperate
with Buyer to assist Buyer in establishing and implementing a retention award
plan in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that is
reasonably acceptable to Buyer.



 

39 (f) The Company shall amend the 2008 Operational and Front-Line Management
Long Term Incentive Plan (the " _Operational Plan_ ") to terminate such plan
as of December 31, 2008 and to provide that, in full and complete satisfaction
of their rights thereunder, participants in such plan shall be entitled to
payment of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) one-third of the maximum
dollar amount that could have been payable pursuant to such plan and (ii) the
aggregate amount accrued in accordance with GAAP and the Companys past
practices, in each case, consistently applied, with respect to bonuses
payable under the Operational Plan as of the termination date of the plan,
with such payments to be made as promptly as possible following 2008 (but in
no event later than March 15, 2009) and, except as otherwise provided in this
sentence, in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of such plan
as in effect on the date hereof, provided that, in the event that, after the
Closing Date and prior to the date on which bonuses under the Operational
Plan are paid, an employees employment is terminated by the Company without
Cause or by the employee for Good Reason, the Company shall pay to the
employee (x) the full earned amount determined under the Operational Plan
as modified by this sentence if the employees employment terminates on or
after December 31, 2008, and (y) the product of (A) the full earned amount
determined under the Operational Plan as modified by this sentence and (B)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in 2008 such
employee was employed through the date of termination and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in 2008, if the employees employment
terminates prior to December 31, 2008.

(g) In the event the Closing Date occurs prior to the date on which bonuses
are payable in the ordinary course under any of the Team Bonus Plan, and the
Alltel Management Incentive Compensation Plan, the Executive Stretch Bonus
Plan, the Annual Base Bonus Plan, and the Special Annual Bonus Plan (each, a "
_Company Bonus Plan_ "), the Company shall pay the earned amounts under such
Company Bonus Plan in accordance with its terms, except that, in the event an
employees employment is terminated by the Company without Cause, or by the
employee for Good Reason, in either case, after the Closing Date and prior to
the date on which bonuses under a Company Bonus Plan are paid, the Company
shall pay to the employee pursuant to (i) or (ii) below, whichever is
applicable: (i) the full earned amount, if the employees employment
terminates on or after the end of the applicable performance period under such
Company Bonus Plan and (ii) the greater of (x) an amount equal to the product
of (1) the full earned amount and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the applicable performance period such employee was
employed through the date of termination and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in the applicable performance period and (y) the full
earned amount assuming, for purposes of measuring performance, that the
performance period ended on the Closing Date, if the employees employment
terminates prior to the end of the applicable performance period. The  



 

40  payments under Section 4.8(f) shall be made to the employee on the date on
which bonus payments are ordinarily paid under such Company Bonus Plan
to active employees of the Company, provided, that, if the Closing Date
occurs in 2008, in no event shall any bonus due to a terminated employee be
paid later than 30 days following the date of such employees termination,
unless the bonus payable cannot be determined on or before such date, in
which case an estimate of the bonus payment shall be paid as of such date,
with a true up payment made as soon as practicable after such determination
can be made. To the extent that, under any contractual arrangement in effect
on the date hereof and otherwise identified on the Disclosure Schedule, any
participant has a contractual to right to a payment under any such Company
Bonus Plan or the Operational Plan, such participant shall receive, without
duplication, the treatment under such contractual arrangement or Section
4.8(f) or Section 4.8(g), as applicable, whichever is more favorable to such
participant. In no event shall the aggregate amount determined to be earned
under any such Company Bonus Plan or the Operational Plan for the performance
period under such Company Bonus Plan or Operational Plan which includes the
Closing Date be less than the amount accrued through the Closing Date and
recorded on the Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP and
the Companys past practices, in each case, consistently applied. Solely for
purposes of determining whether any payment is to be made from a Company Bonus
Plan or the Operational Plan under Section 4.8(f) or Section 4.8(g), the term
"Cause" shall be defined in the same manner as such term is defined in section
2(c) of the Companys 2007 Stock Option Plan, as in effect on the date
hereof, and the term "Good Reason" shall be defined in the same manner as
such term is defined in section 2(p) of the Companys 2007 Stock Option Plan,
as in effect on the date hereof, except that subclause (i) thereof shall be
treated as deleted from such definition. Nothing in Section 4.8(f) or Section
4.8(g) shall be construed to provide any employee any right to any
compensation under a Company Bonus Plan or any other incentive compensation
arrangement that is duplicative of any other incentive compensation payment
for services related to the same period of time.

Section 4.9 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that ( _i_ ) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Buyer,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys
operations prior to the Closing, and ( _ii_ ) prior to the Closing, the
Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.

Section 4.10 _Compliance with FCC Rules_. The Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, operate its business in compliance in all
material respects with all FCC Rules, including all FCC Rules relating to the
sunset of the Cellular Radiotelephone Service Analog Service Requirement and
related requirements, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
in full force and effect and, to the extent applicable, renew, the FCC
Licenses. The Company shall, promptly after the execution of this Agreement,
provide Buyer with copies of any Deployment Requests it has  



 

41  received on or prior to the date of this Agreement, and promptly upon
receipt provide Buyer with copies of any Deployment Requests and any
notifications received by it or any of its Affiliates from the FCC informing
such Person that any of the certifications described in Section 2.8(g) is
unacceptable or results in a change to the Cellular Geographic Service Area of
the applicable FCC License that are received by the Company or any of its
Affiliates after the date hereof. If the Company receives any such
notification, it shall promptly use its reasonable best efforts to take all
necessary actions to preserve such Cellular Geographic Service Area.

Section 4.11 _No Solicitation_. Each of Seller and the Company shall cause any
pending discussions or negotiations with any Third Party regarding any
Acquisition Proposal to be terminated forthwith, and shall notify Buyer
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) and in writing if any proposal
regarding any Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry or contact with any person
with respect thereto) is received by it or any of its Affiliates, and shall
advise Buyer in reasonable detail of the contents thereof (including the terms
thereof and the identity of the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry), and, if in written form, provide Buyer with copies thereof. From
the date hereof until the Closing, none of Seller, the Company or any of their
Affiliates shall, or shall authorize or permit any of its or their respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants or other agents or advisors to, directly or indirectly, ( _a_ )
take any action to solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, ( _b_ ) engage in any discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, assets, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort
by, any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal or a modification of a previously received Acquisition Proposal or (
_c_ ) enter into any agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

Section 4.12  _Potential Sale of Assets_. Between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Buyers expense, cooperate with
Buyer to facilitate the disposition immediately prior to, at or after the
Closing of any assets or ownership interests held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (such assets or interests being a " _Potential Sale Asset_ ");
_provided_ that the actions contemplated thereby do not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to ( _a_ )
permit advisors designated by Buyer and Persons whom Buyer identifies to the
Company as potential purchasers of a Potential Sale Asset to conduct (and
cooperate with such Persons) reasonable investigations with respect to such
Potential Sale Asset (provided that any such Person executes and delivers to
the Company a confidentiality agreement containing customary terms) and ( _b_
) deliver such notices, make such filings and execute such  



 

42  agreements relating to the disposition of Potential Sale Assets as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any such agreement under
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be required to dispose of any
Potential Sale Asset other than immediately prior to, at or after the Closing,
or to agree to restrictions on their businesses or operations prior to the
Closing. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall incur such expenses as Buyer
reasonably requests in connection with any potential disposition of a
Potential Sale Asset; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to
incur expenses in connection with the foregoing in excess of $2 million in the
aggregate unless Buyer advances to the Company funds sufficient to reimburse
the Company for such expenses. Buyer shall be permitted to identify potential
purchasers of Potential Sale Assets and negotiate any agreements with respect
to dispositions of Potential Sale Assets. In the event this Agreement is
terminated, Buyer shall promptly reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in complying with
this Section 4.12, to the extent not previously reimbursed by Buyer (it being
understood that reasonable out-of-pocket expenses shall include any expenses
that Buyer requests the Company to incur pursuant to this Section 4.12).

Section 4.13 _Treatment of Certain Notes_.

(a) Subject to Section 4.13(c), the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use its respective reasonable best efforts to commence, at
Buyers expense, promptly after the receipt of a written request from Buyer to
do so and the receipt of the Offer Documents from Buyer, tender offers to
purchase, and any related consent solicitations with respect to,
any Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the terms and
conditions specified by Buyer in compliance with all applicable covenants in
the existing indentures (collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "), and Buyer shall
assist the Company in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the closing of the Debt Offers shall be conditioned on the Closing and
otherwise in compliance with applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations.
The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, provide cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the Debt Offers. With respect
to any series of Indebtedness, if requested by Buyer in writing, in lieu of
commencing a Debt Offer for such series (or in addition thereto), the Company
shall, to the extent permitted by the indenture and officers certificates or
supplemental indenture governing such series of Indebtedness ( _i_ ) issue a
notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding principal amount of
Indebtedness of such series pursuant to the requisite provisions of the
indenture and officers certificate governing such series of Indebtedness or
( _ii_ ) take actions reasonably requested by Buyer that are reasonably
necessary for the satisfaction and/or discharge and/or defeasance of such
series pursuant to the applicable provisions of the indenture and officers
certificate or supplemental indenture governing such series of Indebtedness,
and shall redeem or satisfy and/or discharge and/or defease, as applicable,
such series in accordance with the  



 

43  terms of the indenture and officers certificate or supplemental indenture
governing such series of Indebtedness at the Closing; provided that to
the extent that any action described in clause (i) or (ii) can be conditioned
on the occurrence of the Effective Time, it will be so conditioned, and, prior
to the Company being required to take any of the actions described in
clause (i) or (ii) above that cannot be conditioned on the occurrence of the
Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit with the trustee under the relevant
indenture governing such Indebtedness sufficient funds to effect such
redemption, satisfaction, discharge or defeasance. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any of the conditions to the Debt
Offers (other than that the Closing shall have occurred and that there shall
be no Law prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offers) as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer in compliance with all applicable covenants in the existing
indentures and shall not, without the written consent of Buyer, waive any
condition to the Debt Offers or make any changes to the Debt Offers other
than as reasonably agreed between Buyer and the Company.

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the
consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are
received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary
shall (and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable
trustee to) execute supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each
series of Indebtedness for which the requisite consent has been received,
which supplemental indentures shall implement the amendments described in the
offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, and other related documents
(collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and shall become operative only
concurrently with the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offers). Concurrent with the
Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to accept for payment and thereafter
promptly pay for any Indebtedness that has been properly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offers and in accordance with the
Debt Offers using funds provided by or at the direction of Buyer.

(c) Buyer shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Debt Offers, including the Offer Documents. The parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate
with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents. The Offer
Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the
holders of Indebtedness in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject to
the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and its legal counsel. If at
any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers any information in the
Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company or any of its Affiliates,
on the one hand, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other, which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that
the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such  



 

44  information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement prepared by Buyer describing such information shall
be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the
holders of the applicable Indebtedness (which supplement or amendment and
dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Buyer, take the form of a
filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 4.13(c), the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the 1934 Act
and any other applicable Law to the extent such laws are applicable in
connection with the Debt Offers and such compliance will not be deemed a
breach hereof.

(d) In connection with the Debt Offers, Buyer may select one or more dealer
managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in
connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, enter into customary agreements (including legal opinions in the customary
form of the Companys outside legal counsel and indemnities) with such parties
so selected.

(e) The Company shall not be required to incur expenses in connection with the
foregoing in excess of $2 million in the aggregate unless Buyer advances to
the Company funds sufficient to reimburse the Company for such expenses. In
the event this Agreement is terminated, Buyer shall promptly reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in
complying with this Section 4.13 to the extent not previously reimbursed by
Buyer (it being understood that reasonable out-of-pocket expenses shall
include any expenses that Buyer requests the Company to incur pursuant to this
Section 4.13), and shall assume any indemnities and other obligations under
any agreements entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries in compliance
with this Section 4.13.

Section 4.14 _Third Party Rights_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply
with its obligations under any notice, consent, right of first refusal or
similar provision to which it is subject in any Organizational Document of any
of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that is triggered by the execution
and delivery or performance of this Agreement (the " _Third Party Rights_ ").
As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Buyer and the Company shall
cooperate to execute a joint certificate that reflects the mutually agreed
upon value (in light of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) of
any equity interest that is subject to a right of first refusal.

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to settle or otherwise
resolve and terminate all Third Party Rights so that the control of the
Companys interests in its Subsidiaries may be conveyed to Buyer as
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall provide Buyer advance
notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment with respect to, all
notices and material correspondence related to the Company  



 

45  carrying out its obligations under this provision, including ( _i_ ) all
communications regarding settlement options with any Person holding
Third Party Rights (the " _Right Holder_ "), ( _ii_ ) all settlement offers
or proposals made or received by the Company to or from a Right Holder and (
_iii_ ) all negotiations and discussions with any Right Holder with respect
to obtaining consents or waivers. Without the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Company shall not make
or enter into any agreement, commitment or undertaking with respect to any
settlement with or purchase of the ownership interest of any Right Holder.

(c) Buyer shall have the right to negotiate and enter into
agreements directly with Persons owning any equity interest in any Subsidiary
of the Company (and the Company shall provide Buyer reasonable cooperation in
connection therewith), which agreement may include the purchase by Buyer of
such equity interest in order to resolve, settle or obtain a waiver of any
claims or rights that arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(d) Without Buyers prior written consent, the Company shall not provide any
consideration to any Third Party in connection with obtaining any consent,
waiver or approval required from any Third Party in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood and agreed that the
failure to provide any such consideration shall not be deemed to breach any
other provision of this Agreement).

(e) At Buyers request, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to amend each Contract specified in Section 4.14 of the Company
Disclosure Letter in the manner set forth therein.

(f) At Buyers reasonable request with respect to any particular Contract to
be entered into (or renewed) after the date hereof, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide in such Contract a right on behalf
of the Company to terminate such Contract within a reasonable period of time
after the Closing Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall
notify Buyer prior to entering into any new Contract that would, if entered
into as of the date hereof, be a Company Material Contract.

Section 4.15 _PIK Toggle Debt_. Without Buyers prior written consent, the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, exercise any
right to pay in kind any interest payments under any PIK Toggle Debt
Obligations, and shall pay all such interest when due in cash.

Section 4.16 _Drag-Along Rights_. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to ( _i_ ) cause to be exercised promptly following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement any rights it or its Affiliates have to require any holder
of Company Common Stock to vote in favor of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the rights under Section 4(a) of
each of the Stockholders Agreements, and ( _ii_ ) 



 

46  cause to be delivered to the Company and Buyer within 30 days of the date
hereof written stockholder consents (or proxies) of all holders of Company
Common Stock approving (or authorizing the proxy to approve) this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.17  _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and representatives to, execute and deliver such
additional instruments, documents, conveyances or assurances and take such
other actions as shall be necessary, or otherwise reasonably be requested by
Buyer or the Company to confirm and assure the rights and obligations provided
for in this Agreement and render effective the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby, or otherwise to carry out the intent and purposes of
this Agreement.

Section 4.18 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent, Buyer, and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
by-laws or other Organizational Documents or in any agreement as in effect on
the date hereof and which has previously been or will be made available to
Parent or Buyer shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect to the extent provided in the following sentence. Parent and Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect any and all
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and by-
laws or similar Organizational Documents or in any indemnification agreements
of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees, in each case in effect as of the
date hereof and which has previously been provided to Parent or Buyer, and
shall not, for a period of six years from the date hereof, amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and all rights to indemnification thereunder in respect of
any Litigation pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Litigation or resolution of such claim.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless
(and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and
former director, officer or employee of Seller, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of  



 

47  any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by Law upon the receipt of any customary
undertaking required by the Surviving Corporation), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened Litigation, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred
whether before or at the Effective Time in connection with such persons
serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of Seller, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any entity if such service was at
the request or for the benefit of Seller or the Company.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and Buyer shall
either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
Seller and the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided
substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to
purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than
such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time
and from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings. The Company may,
and shall upon the request of Buyer (and at Buyers expense), in lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-
year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope)
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by Seller or the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to, and
the Company shall not, incur costs with respect to such policies of directors
and officers liability insurance in excess of the amount specified on
Section 4.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter in the case of an annual payment
or in excess of the amount specified on Section 4.18 of the Company Disclosure
Letter in the case of a tail policy; provided that Parent, Buyer, and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain policies with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the Organizational Documents of Seller, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification
agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The agreements and covenants
contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and  



 

48  employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 4.18 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies. The provisions of this Section 4.18
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) In the event Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns ( _i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or ( _ii_ ) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, Buyer, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 4.18.

Section 4.19 _Swaps_. Upon the request of Buyer, the Company shall, and shall
cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Company (a " _Swap Agreement_ ") in
order to effect the termination of the Companys or its Subsidiaries existing
interest rate swaps immediately prior to and conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the Company or any
Subsidiary be required to enter into any Swap Agreement that would require a
payment by the Company or any such Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time,
unless the Buyer advances to the Company funds sufficient on an after-tax
basis to reimburse the Company for such payment.

52 ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

(a) by the written agreement of Buyer and the Company;

(b) by either Buyer or the Company by notice to the other party, if:

(i) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before August 31, 2009
(the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ that ( _x_ ) the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure
of the Closing to be consummated by such time, or available to Parent or
Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred as a result of the failure of
Parent or Buyer to obtain the Financing, ( _y_ ) if the condition set forth in
Section 6.2(d) shall not have been satisfied solely by reason of the failure
of any Required Governmental Consent that has been obtained to have become a
Final Order, neither party may terminate this Agreement prior to the 60th day
after the date on which such Required Governmental Consent was obtained and (
_z_ ) if the Financing Period shall have commenced on or before the End Date,
but not ended on or before the End Date, the End Date shall be automatically
extended to the date that is five Business Days after the end of the
Financing Period; or

(ii) ( _x_ ) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Closing
illegal or otherwise prohibited or ( _y_ ) any judgment, injunction, order or
decree of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction enjoining
Parent, Buyer or the Company from consummating the Closing is entered and such
judgment, injunction, order or decree shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ that ( _x_ ) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose
breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the imposition of such
judgment, injunction, order or decree;

(c) by Buyer by notice to the Company, if a breach of any representation or
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be satisfied, and such breach is
incapable of being cured by the End Date; or

(d) by the Company by notice to Buyer, if a breach of any representation or
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the  



 

53  part of Parent or Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that
would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) not to be
satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the End Date.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any of
its directors, officers, employees, stockholders, Affiliates, agents,
representatives or advisors) to the other party hereto except as set forth in
Section 4.6(c), the last sentence of Section 4.12, Section 4.13(e), and
Section 7.2(b); _provided_ that no such termination shall relieve either party
of liability for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or intentional
conduct constituting or resulting in a breach of this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 7.2 and of Section 4.6(c), the last sentence of
Section 4.12, Section 4.13(e), Sections 8.1 and 8.2, and Article IX, shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 7.1. 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, and the proximate
cause of such termination is the failure to satisfy any condition set forth
in Section 6.1(a), 6.1(b), 6.2(d), 6.2(e) or 6.3(b) as a result of Parents or
Buyers decision not to agree to any action, restriction, condition or
constraint or combination thereof that would meet the standard set forth in
clause (x), and not clause (y), of the definition of Burdensome Condition but
would not result in aggregate divestitures in excess of 2.8 million
subscribers of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
then Buyer shall pay to the Company contemporaneously with such termination an
amount equal to $500 million in cash.
