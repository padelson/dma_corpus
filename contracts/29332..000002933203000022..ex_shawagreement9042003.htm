 1. _Purchase and Sale of Acquired Assets; Assumption of Assumed Liabilities.

   _

 1. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Seller, and the Seller agrees to sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to the Purchaser, all of the Acquired Assets at the Closing for the consideration specified in Section 2.2 below, free and clear of any Security Interest. Seller agrees that all liens and other Security Interests will be terminated on or before the Closing.

 

 2. On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees to assume and become responsible for the Assumed Liabilities at the Closing for the consideration specified in Section 2.2 below. The Purchaser will not assume or have any responsibility, however, with respect to any Liability or obligation of the Seller which is not included among the Assumed Liabilities or which is an Excluded Liability.

 

 3. In the event of any claim against the Purchaser with respect to any of the Assumed Liabilities, without limiting Purchaser\'s remedies or defenses, the Seller hereby assigns to the Purchaser, any defense, counterclaim, or right of setoff which would have been available to the Seller if such claim had been asserted against the Seller.

 

 4. The assumption by the Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities, and the transfer thereof by the Seller, shall in no way expand the rights or remedies of any third party against the Purchaser, or its officers, directors, employees, stockholders, and advisors as compared to the rights and remedies which such third party would have had against the Seller had the Purchaser not assumed the Assumed Liabilities. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the assumption by the Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities shall not create any third-party beneficiary rights. The Seller shall pay and discharge when due, or contest in good faith, all of those Liabilities of the Seller which the Purchaser has not specifically agreed to assume pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

  

 2. _Asset Purchase Consideration.

   _

 1. At Closing, in consideration for the sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment, and delivery of the Acquired Assets by the Seller to the Purchaser, and the assumption by the Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities from the Seller, the Seller shall be entitled to receive, in the manner described in Section 2.4 below and subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 2.2(b), Section 2.3 and Section 2.7 below, Two Hundred Five Million Dollars ($205,000,000.00) (as adjusted, the " _Asset Purchase Consideration_ ").

 

 2. No later than five (5) business days prior to Closing, the Parties shall jointly and in good faith estimate and agree in writing with respect to the value of the Closing Receivables, the Closing Inventory, and the Net Asset Value (such written estimate, the " _Estimated Purchase Price Schedule_ "). At Closing, the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be adjusted as follows:

   

 1. In the event that the Closing Receivables set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule are less than Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00), the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be reduced by such deficit, and if the Closing Receivables set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule are greater than Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00), the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be increased by such excess;

 

 2. In the event that the Closing Inventory set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule is less than Forty Five Million Dollars ($45,000,000.00), the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be reduced by such deficit, and if the Closing Inventory set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule is greater than Forty Five Million Dollars ($45,000,000.00), the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be increased by such excess; and

 

 3. In the event that the Net Asset Value set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule is less than Seventy Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000.00), the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be reduced by such deficit.

   

In the event that the Parties are unable to agree upon the contents of the
Estimated Purchase Price Schedule at or prior to Closing (it being
acknowledged that such agreement shall not be a condition to the Closing of
the Contemplated Transactions), and the Closing occurs, the Parties hereby
covenant and agree that, for the purposes of this Section 2.2(b) and for the
purposes of completing the transactions and making the calculations
contemplated by Section 2.7 below, an Estimated Purchase Price Schedule which
states that (i) the Closing Receivables are Twenty Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000.00), (ii) the Closing Inventory is Forty Five Million Dollars
($45,000,000.00), and (iii) the Net Asset Value is Seventy Five Million
Dollars ($75,000,000.00), shall be used in lieu thereof.

title, and interest in and to the Business to the Purchaser, at Closing, the
following adjustments shall be made to the Asset Purchase Consideration, as
further calculated and in accordance with the Funds Flow and Settlement

 1. The Seller agrees that it shall pay the real estate transfer Tax applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent that the Seller is not a deemed resident of the State of Georgia or the State of Indiana, the Purchaser shall withhold that portion of the Asset Purchase Consideration as is required pursuant to Georgia and Indiana Legal Requirements, and the Purchaser shall further pay such withholding to the appropriate Georgia and Indiana Governmental Body in accordance with such Georgia and Indiana Legal Requirements.

 

 2. The Purchaser agrees that it shall pay (i) the cost of recording all documents to be recorded (except for those title clearance documents which shall be paid by Seller), (ii) the cost of any title examination fees, any premium of title insurance, survey fees, engineering fees, to the extent ordered by Purchaser or its agents or representatives. 

 

 3. Real and personal property ad valorem Taxes, or payments in lieu of Taxes, assessed against the Business and its properties for the year in which Closing occurs shall be prorated as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date. As of Closing, the Seller shall provide Purchaser copies of all Tax bills, or bills relating to payments in lieu of Tax, for the Real Property and the Assumed Real Property Lease for the year of Closing. In the event actual Tax figures, or figures relating to payments in lieu of Tax, are not available as of Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser agree, that prorations shall be based upon the most recent available figures relating to Taxes, or payments in lieu of Taxes, and upon request of either Party, to promptly adjust such prorations upon the availability of such figures relating to Taxes, or payments in lieu of Taxes, as of the Closing. The obligations of Seller and Purchaser set forth in this Section 2.3(c) shall survive the Closing.

 

 4. The Purchaser shall pay all sales tax imposed on the transfer of personal property assets pursuant to this Agreement.

The Parties agree to make such post-Closing prorations as soon as reasonably practicable subsequent to the Closing. The agreements in this Section 2.3(f) shall survive Closing.

  

 4. _Payment of Asset Purchase Consideration.

 _

At Closing, the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be paid as follows, as
further calculated and in accordance with the Funds Flow and Settlement
Statement:

   

 1. that amount, if any, of the Asset Purchase Consideration necessary to be paid to applicable lenders and other creditors of the Seller to release all Security Interests with respect to the Business, or otherwise obtain clear title to the Acquired Assets, shall be paid to such lenders and other creditors in accordance with the payoff letters or other documentation provided by such creditors;

 4. the balance of the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller by wire transfer or other immediately available funds to a bank or other account designated by Seller, which bank or other account was designated by Seller in writing to the Purchaser at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date.

  

 5. _Time and Place of Closing.

 _

The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer and

(the " _Closing Date_ "). Subject to the provisions of Section 8, failure to
consummate the purchase and sale provided for in this Agreement on the date
and time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 2.5 will not
result in the termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of
any obligation under this Agreement.

 

 6. _Deliveries at the Closing.

certificates, instruments, and documents referred to in Section 6 below; the
Purchaser will deliver to the Seller the various certificates, instruments,

 1. _The Asset Purchase Consideration shall be reduced or increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis in accordance with this Section 2.7. Any decrease or increase in the Asset Purchase Consideration shall be referred to as a " _Purchase Price Adjustment_ ".

 

 2. No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare, with the participation and cooperation of the Purchaser, and deliver to the Purchaser (A) a statement (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") setting forth (i) the accounts receivable of the Seller included in the Acquired Assets as of close of business on the Closing Date, as determined in accordance with GAAP, except (x) that any accounts receivable which are not collected in full by the Purchaser within thirty (30) days following the due date of that account receivable having the latest payment due date shall be valued at the amount collected, and (y) any receivable described in subsection (x) immediately above shall be assigned to the Seller for collection and excluded from the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Receivables_ "), (ii) the net inventories calculated on a first-in, first-out basis of the Seller included in the Acquired Assets as the close of business on the Closing Date, as determined in accordance with GAAP (the " _Closing Inventory_ "), and (iii) the net book value of the fixed assets of the Seller with respect to the Business as of June 30, 2003, as determined in accordance with GAAP, but adjusted for any additions or deletions (other than depreciation) with respect to the period between June 30, 2003, and the Closing Date (the " _Net Asset Value_ "), and (B) a separate statement showing any calculations with respect to any necessary Purchase Price Adjustment (the " _Final Adjustment Schedule_ "). At Closing, and periodically thereafter until the completion of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Adjustment Schedule, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser a list of those accounts receivable of the Business which may contain Excluded Assets. For the purpose of preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet and Final Adjustment Schedule, and valuing the Closing Receivables thereunder, (i) to the extent that it is not clear from the face of an account receivable whether it constitutes a Closing Receivable, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to identify those accounts receivable which relate to the Business and constitute Acquired Assets, and those accounts receivable which constitute Excluded Assets, and (ii) the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Closing Receivables.

 

 3. The Purchaser shall, within thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Adjustment Schedule, accept or reject the Purchase Price Adjustment submitted by Parent. If the Purchaser disagrees with such calculation, it shall give written notice to Parent of such disagreement and any reason therefor within such thirty (30) day period. Should the Purchaser fail to notify Parent of a disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, the Purchaser shall be deemed to agree with Parent\'s calculation. Any disagreement with respect to the determination of any Purchase Price Adjustment shall be referred to the DeCosimo CPA Firm (the " _Arbitrator_ "). The Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator and shall issue its report as to the contents of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment reflected in the Final Adjustment Schedule within sixty (60) days after such dispute is referred to the Arbitrator. The Parent on the one hand, and the Purchaser on the other hand, shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with such arbitration, except that the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator hereunder shall be borne by the Parent and the Purchaser in such proportion as the Arbitrator shall determine based on the relative merit of the position of the Parties. This provision for arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the Parties and the decision of the Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be final and binding with respect to the matters so arbitrated and there shall be no right of appeal therefrom.

 

 4. If, based on the Final Adjustment Schedule as finally determined:

   

 1. the Closing Receivables are less than the Closing Receivables set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule, the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser such deficit, and if the Closing Receivables are greater than the Closing Receivables set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule, the Purchaser shall pay to the Parent such excess;

 

 2. the Closing Inventory is less than the Closing Inventory set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule, the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser such deficit, and if the Closing Inventory is greater than the Closing Inventory set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule, the Purchaser shall pay to Parent such excess; and

 

 3. the Net Asset Value is less than the Net Asset Value set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Schedule, the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser such deficit.

  

In the event that the Final Adjustment Schedule shall reflect amounts due to
both Parent and the Purchaser, such amounts shall be netted to reflect one
payment which shall be due and payable to either Parent or the Purchaser, as
the case may be. Final amounts due hereunder shall be paid no later than five
(5) business days following the Purchaser\'s agreement with the Parent\'s
calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment, or in the event of a
disagreement, following the resolution of such disagreement by written
agreement of the Purchaser and the Parent, or the determination of the
Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.7(c) above.

 

 5. In addition to the payments due under the Final Adjustment Schedule:

   

 1. Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for the amount of any Closing Receivables reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Adjustment Schedule which are not collected by the Purchaser within the earlier of sixty (60) days after their due date or one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the Final Adjustment Schedule. The Purchaser shall reassign to Seller all rights to Closing Receivables for which reimbursement has been paid.

 

 2. To the extent that the Final Adjustment Schedule as finally determined herein shall either (x) identify an account receivable as a Closing Receivable which is later discovered to be an Excluded Asset, or (y) omit to include a Closing Receivable which is an Acquired Asset and collected or collectible, the Party identifying such discrepancy shall notify the other Parties of the same, and propose any required amendment to the Final Adjustment Schedule and amounts due hereunder in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.7(c) above. Any dispute with the Final Adjustment Schedule so amended shall be resolved as contemplated by Section 2.7(c) above.

   

 8. _Allocation of Asset Purchase Consideration.

  _

The Asset Purchase Consideration will be allocated among the Acquired Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities, and the Real Property, for all purposes (including
Tax purposes) in accordance with the methodology, which shall be agreed to
among the Parties within ninety (90) days following the Closing (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Each of the Parties hereto will not take a
position on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Body charged with the

timely filing consistent with such allocation on applicable forms with the

Other than obtaining the requisite approvals under the HSR Act, the Purchaser is not required to obtain any Consent from any Person in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions. 

  

 3. _Certain Proceedings.

 _

There is no pending Proceeding that has been commenced against the Purchaser
and that challenges, or may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making
illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of the Contemplated Transactions.
To the Knowledge of the Purchaser, no such Proceeding has been threatened.

 

 4. _Brokers or Finders.

 _

The Purchaser and its directors, officers and agents have not incurred any
obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders\'
fees or agents\' commissions or other similar payment in connection with this
Agreement.

 

 5. _Disclosure.

  _

The representations and warranties contained in this Section 4 do not, and as
of the Closing Date will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statement

 4. COVENANTS

   

 1. _Access and Investigation.

 _

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Seller will, and
will cause its Representatives to, (a) afford the Purchaser and its
Representatives (collectively, " _Purchaser\'s Advisors_ ") full and free
access to the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Business, the
payroll information (but only at such times reasonably agreeable to the
Parties), properties (including for purposes of subsurface and other
environmental testing), contracts, books and records, and other documents and
data of the Business, (b) furnish Purchaser\'s Advisors with copies of all
such contracts, books and records, and other existing documents and data as
Purchaser\'s Advisors may reasonably request, and (c) furnish Purchaser\'s
Advisors with such additional financial, payroll, operating, and other data
and information as Purchaser\'s Advisors may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may refuse to provide information that
relates to pricing of products or identity of customers to the extent it shall
reasonably determine such information to be inappropriate to disclose. In case
at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the Parties will take such further action
(including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as any other Party reasonably may request, at the sole cost and
expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor hereunder). The Seller acknowledges and agrees that
from and after the Closing the Purchaser will have the right to possession of
all documents, books, records (including non-income Tax records), agreements,
and financial data of any sort relating to the Acquired Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, and the Business (other than Excluded Assets, and materials
constituting attorney-client privilege materials or materials subject to
privacy obligations not waivable by the Seller); _provided, however_ , that
the Seller shall have the right to obtain access to such documents, books,
records (including Tax records), agreements, and financial data to the extent
related to the period prior to the Closing and make photocopies thereof for a
proper purpose, such as in connection with the preparation of their Tax
Returns.

 

 2. _Operation of the Business.

 _

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Seller will: (a)
operate the Business (or otherwise conduct the Business) only in the Ordinary
Course of Business; (b) use its Best Efforts to preserve intact the current
business organization, keep available the services of the current employees
and agents, and maintain the relations and good will with suppliers,
landlords, creditors, employees, agents, and others having business
relationships with the Business; (c) confer with the Purchaser concerning
operational matters of the Business of a material nature; and (d) otherwise
report periodically to the Purchaser concerning the status of the Business,
the Acquired Assets, and the Assumed Liabilities.

 

 3. _Negative Covenant.

 _

Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Seller will not, without the prior
consent of the Purchaser, take any affirmative action, or fail to take any
reasonable action within its control, as a result of which any of the changes
or events listed in Section 3.11 could occur. The Purchaser shall have the
right to examine title to Real Property and other Acquired Assets in respect
to the facilities of the Business at any time up to Closing for the purpose of
ascertaining whether Seller has further voluntarily encumbered the Real
Property.

 

 4. _Required Approvals.

 _

As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each Party will
use its respective Best Efforts to receive all necessary Consents of each
Governmental Body from which Consent may be required to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions, including but not limited to the HSR Act. As
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Seller will use
its Best Efforts to receive all necessary Consents (i) of all lenders,
lessors, development authorities, joint venturers, and other Persons whose
consent to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions may be required,
or who may have a Security Interest on any of the Acquired Assets, and further
to obtain termination and transfer agreements from each lessor (including but
not limited to the requisite UCC-3 termination statements), and (ii) with
respect to each matter, and from each Person, specifically identified in
_Exhibit A_ (collectively, the " _Required Approvals_ "). Between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date, each Party will cooperate with each other
Party with respect to all filings that each such Party elects to make or is
required by Legal Requirements to make in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, including but not limited to under the HSR Act.

 

 5. _Release of Security Interests.

 _

The Seller will cause the release of all Security Interests on the Acquired
Assets prior to or simultaneous with the Closing.

 

 6. _No Negotiation.

 _

Until such time, if any, as this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8, Seller agrees not to solicit or consider other proposals concerning the
sale of the Business, the Acquired Assets, or the Assumed Liabilities to other
entities expressing interest in acquiring, leasing or managing the Acquired
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the Business whether for themselves or
others, or to divulge or otherwise disclose any information to such entities
regarding any aspects of the Contemplated Transactions, including but not
limited to, purchase price, terms, or status of negotiations and discussions
between Seller, the Purchaser, or their authorized representatives, except to
the extent necessary to comply with the applicable disclosure requirements of
the NASDAQ stock exchange, or applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Parent and its board of directors may consider other bona
fide and unsolicited proposals by third parties with respect to the
acquisition of all of the Business, the Acquired Assets, and the Assumed
Liabilities (each such bona fide and unsolicited proposal, an " _Alternative
Proposal_ "), provided Parent\'s board of directors concludes, based on an
opinion of counsel, that it must consider such to avoid a breach of its
fiduciary duties arising under applicable Legal Requirements. In the event
that the board of directors of the Parent concludes in good faith that such
Alternative Proposal shall provide consideration to the Seller of materially
greater value than the Asset Purchase Consideration hereunder and is otherwise
in the best interests of the Parent\'s shareholders, then the Parent may
accept such Alternative Proposal and terminate this Agreement after affording
the Purchaser not less than five (5) business days in which to meet the terms
and purchase price of such Alternative Proposal. In the event of such
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.6, the Parent shall
promptly on demand therefor, pay to the Purchaser the sum of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000.00), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.

 

 7. _Best Efforts.

 _

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, each of the Parties
will use their respective Best Efforts to cause the conditions in Sections 6
and 7 to be satisfied and to preserve intact the Business and the Acquired
Assets.

 

 8. _Litigation Support.

 _

Following the Closing, in the event and for so long as any Party actively is
contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand in connection with (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving any Party, each of the other Parties will reasonably cooperate
with the contesting or defending Party and his or its counsel in the contest
or defense, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and
access to its books and records as shall be necessary in connection with the
contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Section 9 below).

 

 9. _Transition.

 _

Each Party will use its respective Best Efforts not to take any action that is
designed or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor,
supplier, employee or other business associate of the Seller with respect to
the Business from maintaining the same business relationships with the
Purchaser after the Closing as it maintained with the Seller prior to the
Closing.

 

 10. _Assignment of Interests in Acquired Assets.

 _

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute or require an
assignment or an attempt to assign any of the Acquired Assets if the attempted
assignment without the consent of a third party would adversely affect in any
way the rights of the Purchaser. If any such consent shall not have been
obtained at or prior to the Closing, or the attempted transfer or assignment
of any of the Acquired Assets, would have an adverse effect on the Purchaser,
then, at the Purchaser\'s option, the Seller will cooperate with the Purchaser
in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide for the Purchaser the rights
and benefits of such Acquired Assets, including, enforcing for the benefit of
the Purchaser any or all rights of the Seller against any other party arising
out of the breach or cancellation by such other party, while permitting the
Purchaser the possession and use of such Acquired Assets for Purchaser\'s
account as if such Acquired Assets had been so transferred, assigned and
delivered, or otherwise. Following the Closing, pending the obtaining of such
consents, approvals or novations, the Purchaser will continue performance of
any remaining unfulfilled obligations of the Seller under any of the
agreements in the same manner as though the same were subcontracted to the
Purchaser on the same terms and conditions as contained in the agreements.

 

 11. _Tax Matters.

   _

 1. With respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties will provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them may reasonably require of the other in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, including Tax Returns relating to the application of the successor employer rules for payroll Tax purposes contained in IRC Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1), the determination of a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund for Taxes, or the preparation for litigation or investigation of any claim for Taxes or a right to a refund for Taxes, or the preparation for cooperation and information shall include all relevant Tax Returns, and other documents and records, or portions thereof relating to or necessary in connection with the preparation of records, or portions thereof relating to or necessary in connection with the preparation of such Tax Returns or other determination of Tax Liability. Each Party shall retain all Tax Returns (other than income tax returns), schedules, workpapers, and all other materials, records or documents with respect to the Business and the Acquired Assets until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the taxable years to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate. Any information obtained under this provision shall be kept confidential by the Parties, except as may be necessary in connection with the filing of such Tax Returns.

 

 2. To the extent otherwise applicable, the Seller and the Purchaser agree to waive compliance with applicable bulk sales notification statutes and regulations, in connection with the sale of the Acquired Assets to the Purchaser.

  

 12. _Notice of Developments.

 _

The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser promptly after the Seller becomes
aware of any change affecting the content of, or information with respect to,
the Disclosure Schedule, but in any event no later than two (2) days prior to
the Closing Date, revised Disclosure Schedules to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3, to reflect any matters which have occurred
from and after the date of this Agreement, which, if existing on the date of
this Agreement, would have resulted in a disclosure or exception with regard
to any such representation and warranty; provided, however, that Seller shall
have no obligation to revise or update any Disclosure Schedule or any part of
the Disclosure Schedules to reflect changes in fact or circumstance that are
the result of conduct of the Business in the Ordinary Course of Business,
unless Seller has Knowledge that such update would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Business. If in the Purchaser\'s
reasonable determination any such modifications or amendments would, if true
at Closing, constitute or result in a material adverse change to the Acquired
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or to the Business (to the extent such
Business is being transferred to the Purchaser hereunder), the Purchaser shall
have until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) five (5) days after
receipt of such notice to notify Seller of its intent to terminate this
Agreement or to propose an adjustment to the Asset Purchase Consideration,
provided that, prior to any termination of this Agreement, the Seller shall be
afforded a reasonable opportunity to cure any such defect, which cure shall,
in any event, be completed no less than five (5) days after Purchaser\'s
notice to Seller of its election to terminate. If the Seller does not cure
such defect or, at its election does not agree to any proposed adjustment to
the Asset Purchase Consideration, the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement.
Unless the Purchaser exercises such right of termination within such five (5)
day period, the written notice delivered to the Purchaser will be deemed to
have amended the Disclosure Schedule and to have cured any misrepresentation
or breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder.

 

 13. _Restrictive Covenants.

   _

 1. From the date of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, the Seller will not, directly or indirectly, for itself or for any other Person (other than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates), (i) solicit, attempt to employ or enter into any contractual employment arrangement with any employee or independent contractor of the Seller or the Business or any former employee or independent contractor of the Business hired by the Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than employees terminated by Purchaser), until twelve (12) months after such former employee\'s employment with the Purchaser has ended, as the case may be, (ii) call on or solicit any of the customers of the Business engaged in factory-built and modular housing, and exposition/trade show industries for the purpose of competing with the Purchaser, (iii) except for products substantially similar to those manufactured by Fabrica and Masland, call on or solicit any of the customers of the Business engaged in the recreational vehicle industry for the purpose of competing with the Purchaser, or (iv) engage in the manufacture, sale or distribution of needlebond goods and tufted grass goods. Nothing herein shall limit Seller\'s activities in the manufacture, sale or distribution of carpet products to other channels of distribution, including without limitation the dealer, home center or independent retailer chain of distribution (except with respect to the foregoing needlebond products).

 

 2. From and after the Closing, the Seller will treat and hold as confidential all of the Confidential Information of the Business, and the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in respect to the Contemplated Transactions, refrain from using any of the Confidential Information of the Business and deliver promptly to the Purchaser or destroy, at the request and option of the Purchaser, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential Information of the Business which are in its possession. In the event that the Seller is requested or required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information of the Business, or the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in respect to the Contemplated Transactions, such Seller will notify the Purchaser promptly of the request or requirement so that the Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.13(b). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information of the Business or the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in respect to the Contemplated Transactions, to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, the Seller may disclose the Confidential Information of the Business or the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in respect to the Contemplated Transactions, as the case may be, to the tribunal; _provided, however,_ that the Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of the Purchaser and at the sole expense of the Purchaser, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information of the Business or the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in respect to the Contemplated Transactions, as the case may be, required to be disclosed as the Purchaser shall designate.

 

 3. If any covenant in this Section 5.13 is held to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy, such covenant will be considered to be divisible with respect to scope, time, and geographic area, and such lesser scope, time or geographic area, or all of them, as a court of competent jurisdiction may determine to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and not against public policy, will be effective, binding, and enforceable against the Parties.

 

 4. The Seller agrees and acknowledges that money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Section 5.13 and that the Purchaser may in their sole discretion apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this Section 5.13.

  

 14. _Business Employees.

 _

Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties, on the Closing Date, the Purchaser
will cause the Purchaser or its Affiliate to offer at-will employment to all
hourly and salaried employees of the Seller with respect to the Business that
are either plant level employees or are described and identified on _Schedule
3.16(a)_ , but only who immediately prior to the Closing were actively
employed by the Seller, or on approved leave of absence from the Seller
(including, without limitation, maternity, disability, medical and non-medical
leave) (collectively, the " _Business Employees_ "), which offer of employment
shall be subject to the Purchaser\'s standard employment policies. As to those
three employees of the Business separately identified in _Schedule 5.14_ to
whom Purchaser will not offer employment, Purchaser will nevertheless offer
severance pay in accordance with Seller\'s severance pay plan set forth on
_Schedule 2.1(e)_ hereto, so long as such employees are terminated by the
Seller on or before the Closing Date and not subsequently rehired for a period
of six (6) months. The Purchaser shall offer to Business Employees past
service credit under the Purchaser\'s benefit plans for service rendered to
Seller. In no event shall "Business Employee" include any employee who
provides any services to the Seller which do not relate to the Business.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Purchaser is not assuming any
Liability with respect to (i) any employment, deferred compensation, or
similar Contract with any Business Employee, (ii) any severance obligation to
any Business Employee, or any other employee of the Seller, or (iii) any
Company Plan. Further, the Parties agree that Seller, at its sole cost and
expense, shall be solely responsible for any continuation coverage required
under COBRA (including continuation coverage resulting from any transactions
prior to or contemplated by this Agreement).

 

 15. _Transition Services Agreement.

 _

Following execution of this Agreement and prior to Closing, the Parties will
evaluate and negotiate in good faith a transition services agreement (the "
_Transition Services Agreement_ ") which shall have a term of ninety (90) to
one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing and provide for (i) Seller
providing services to the Purchaser with respect to transition matters such as
billing, invoicing, order entry and related accounting, human resources,
headquarters and other administrative matters until such time as the Purchaser
can reasonably migrate those functions to its systems, (ii) the Purchaser
providing services to Seller with respect to the continued production and
distribution of Seller\'s products not included within the assets which are in
process or otherwise appropriate to be manufactured at the Business Facilities
to be sold hereunder, and (iii) the Parties providing each other with the
right to use certain assets, trademarks, and properties on a temporary basis,
in each case with such reasonable reimbursement of costs and expenses as the
Parties shall agree in good faith with respect to the individual service
provided.

 

 16. _C andA Materials Agreement.

 _

From and after the Closing, the Parties agree that the Purchaser shall
purchase from CAF Extrusion approximately Two Hundred Fifty Thousand (250,000)
pounds per week of 1050\'s Natural Nylon at a price established by the same
terms and conditions as those set forth in the Seller\'s existing Contract
with CAF Extrusion (represented to be a CAF Extrusion cost _plus_ $0.10 per
pound, which is, as of the date hereof, $1.21 per pound), adjusted for changes
in CAF\'s actual per pound cost of the raw materials used in manufacturing the
nylon, taking into account all discounts and rebates received by CAF for such
materials and including all charges and other expenses paid by CAF for such
materials, including without limitation, inbound freight, taxes and other
similar charges; provided, however, that Purchaser\'s obligations under this
Section 5.16 shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the purchase, in the
aggregate, by the Purchaser from the Seller of Ten Million (10,000,000) pounds
of such raw materials sold to Seller pursuant to the CAF Extrusion Contract,
or (ii) the termination of expiration, for any reason whatsoever, of the CAF
Extrusion Contract.

 6. by the Parent on one hand, or the Purchaser on the other hand, in the event that either the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice, under the HSR Act, shall, as a condition to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or otherwise, place any material restriction with regard to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, require the modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or otherwise require any Party to cause the divestiture or transfer any of its respective assets or properties;

 

 7. by the Purchaser on the one hand, or the Parent on the other hand, if the Closing has not occurred (other than through the failure of any Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before December 30, 2003, or such later date as the Parties may agree upon.

  

 2. _Effect of Termination.

  _

Each Party\'s right of termination under Section 8.1 is in addition to any
other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise
of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, all further obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations
in Section 5.13(b) and Section 10 will survive; provided, however, that if
this Agreement is terminated by a Party because of the breach of the Agreement
by the other Party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating
Party\'s obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the
other Party\'s failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement,
the terminating Party\'s right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired.

 

 8. INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES

   

 1. _Survival.

 _

All representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations in this Agreement,
the Disclosure Schedule, the certificates delivered pursuant to Section
6.1(c)(iv) and Section 7.2(b), and any other certificate or document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing. The right to
indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations will not be affected
by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.

 

 2. _Indemnification and Payment of Damages by the Seller.

 _

Each Seller, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser and its Representatives, shareholders, controlling persons, and
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for, and will pay to
the Indemnified Persons the amount of, any loss, Liability, claim, damage
(including incidental and consequential damages), expense (including costs of
investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys\' fees) or diminution of
value, whether or not involving a third-party claim (collectively, " _Damages_
"), arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with:

   

 1. any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Seller in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule, or any other certificate or document delivered by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

 

 2. any breach by the Seller of any covenant or obligation of the Seller in this Agreement;

 

 3. any Liability of the Seller which is either not included among the Assumed Liabilities or is an Excluded Liability (including without limitation any claim or Proceeding set forth on _Schedule 3.9_ [Legal Proceedings; Orders] hereof).

  

 3. _Indemnification and Payment of Damages by the Purchaser.

 _

The Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, and will pay to
them the amount of any Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in
connection with (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Purchaser in this Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any breach by the Purchaser of any
covenant or obligation of the Purchaser in this Agreement, (c) any of the
Acquired Assets, or (d) any of the Assumed Liabilities.

 

 4. _Time Limitations.

 _

If the Closing occurs, the Seller will not have any liability (for
indemnification or otherwise) with respect to (i) the Operational
Representations and (ii) any Excess Product Warranty Claims, unless on or
before the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchaser
notifies the Seller of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in
reasonable detail to the extent then known by the Purchaser; a claim with
respect to any Fundamental Representation, or a claim for indemnification or
reimbursement based upon any other provision of this Agreement, or any
covenant or obligation to be performed and complied by the Seller, may be made
at any time.

 

 5. _Limitations on Amount -- the Seller.

 _

The Seller\'s maximum liability for Damages with respect to a claim for
indemnification or reimbursement based upon a breach of (i) the Operational
Representations, and (ii) Excess Product Warranty Claims, shall be limited to
and shall not exceed the Escrow Amount. The Seller\'s maximum liability for
Damages with respect to a claim for indemnification or reimbursement based
upon a breach of the Fundamental Representations, or a claim for
indemnification or reimbursement based upon any other provision of this
Agreement, or any covenant or obligation to be performed and complied by the
Seller, shall be limited to and shall not exceed the Asset Purchase
Consideration.

 

 6. _Limitations on Amount -- the Purchaser.

 _

The Purchaser\'s maximum liability for Damages with respect to a claim for
indemnification or reimbursement based on a breach of this Agreement shall be
limited to and shall not exceed the Asset Purchase Consideration.

 

 7. _Escrow Agreement.

 _

As security for the indemnification obligations of the Seller under this
Agreement, the Parties and the Escrow Agent shall enter into the Escrow
Agreement as of the Closing Date, which shall be funded with Eight Million
Dollars ($8,000,000.00) of the Asset Purchase Consideration otherwise payable
to the Seller (the " _Escrow Amount_ "). The amounts held in the Escrow
Agreement shall be held for a period of one (1) year. Amounts held under the
Escrow Agreement shall be (i) an exclusive source of indemnification for any
of (A) the Operational Representations, and (B) the Excess Product Warranty
Claims, and (ii) nonexclusive source of indemnification for any Fundamental
Representations, and any other representations, warranties, or covenants under
this Agreement, and shall not otherwise limit the liability of the Seller with
respect to indemnification under this Agreement.

 

 8. _Procedure for Indemnification -- Third Party Claims.

   

 1. _Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying party\'s failure to give such notice.

 

 2. If any Proceeding referred to in Section 9.8(a) is brought against an indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 9 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified party\'s consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within ten days after the indemnified party\'s notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party.

 

 3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

 

 4. The Parties hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding is brought against any indemnified party for purposes of any claim that an indemnified party may have under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and agree that process may be served on such Persons with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.

  

 9. _Procedure for Indemnification -- Other Claims.

  _

A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim
may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

 

 9. GENERAL PROVISIONS

preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement and the Contemplated

of such Party arising from a breach of this Agreement by another Party.

 6. _Waiver.

 _

The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not alternative.
Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power,
or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no

preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or
the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent

 7. _Entire Agreement and Modification.

 _

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the Parties with

of the agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. This
Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by each of
the Parties.

 

 8. _Disclosure Schedule.

   _

 1. The disclosures in the Disclosure Schedule must relate only to the representations and warranties in the Section of the Agreement to which they expressly relate and not to any other representation or warranty in this Agreement.

 

 2. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Schedule (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedule with respect to a specifically identified representation or warranty), the statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

 

 3. No due diligence conducted by the Purchaser shall limit or be used as a defense by the Seller with respect to any claim of breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by the Seller under this Agreement.

  

 9. _Joint and Several; Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights.

 _

The obligations and liabilities of each of (i) the Seller and (ii) the
Purchaser under the Transaction Documents shall be joint and several. No Party
may assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement without the
prior consent of the other Parties, except that the Purchaser may assign any
of its rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Purchaser without
the consent of the Seller. This Agreement will apply to, be binding in all
respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted
assigns of the Parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement

any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its provisions and
conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Parties and their

With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, time is of the essence.

 

 13. _Governing Law.
