Section 2.01 . The Merger.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP,
425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as possible, but in

forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied
or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of such conditions; provided, however, that if the Marketing Period
has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article 9 (excluding conditions that by their nature, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the date following the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of (a)
a date during the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent on no less than
two Business Days' notice to the Company, (b) the final day of the Marketing
Period and (c) the End Date (or the Closing may be consummated at such other
place and on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree)
(the date on which Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

  

  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger

time as Parent and the Company may agree and is specified in the certificate
of merger).

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(c), Section 2.02(d) or
Section 2.04, each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a unit consisting
of (i) $16.50 in cash, without interest (the "Company Share Cash
Consideration") and (ii) 0.03702 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Company
Share Stock Consideration" and, together with the Company Share Cash
Consideration the "Company Shares Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective
Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Company Shares Merger
Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(c), Section 2.02(d) or
Section 2.04, each Series A Preferred Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (which excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, any Series A
Preferred Shares converted into Company Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to a Contingent Conversion Notice (as defined in the
Voting Agreement)) shall be converted into the right to receive a unit
consisting of (i) the product of 148.80952 multiplied by the Company Share
Cash Consideration (the "Preferred Share Cash Consideration") and (ii) the
product of 148.80952 multiplied by the Company Share Stock Consideration (the
"Preferred Share Stock Consideration" and, together with the Preferred Share
Cash Consideration the "Series A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration"). As
of the Effective Time, all such Series A Preferred Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Series A
Preferred Shares Merger Consideration.

  

  

(c) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than Company
Shares in an Employee Plan of the Company) or owned by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

  

(d) Each Share, if any, held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of either the
Company or Parent (other than the Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares or fractional
shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned
in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except for
any such shares resulting from the conversion of Shares pursuant to Section
2.02(d)).

  

  

Section 2.03 . Surrender and Payment.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of: (i)
exchanging the Company Shares Merger Consideration for the certificates
representing Company Shares (the "Company Share Certificates") or the
uncertificated Company Shares (the "Uncertificated Company Shares") and (ii)
exchanging the Series A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration for the
certificates representing Series A Preferred Shares (the "Series A Preferred
Share Certificates"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent (A) the Company Shares Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Company Share Certificates and the Uncertificated
Company Shares and (B) the Series A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Series A Preferred Share Certificates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Company Shares at the Effective Time
a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Company Share Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Company Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.
Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Company Shares Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive,
upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Share Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of
an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Company Shares, the Company Shares Merger
Consideration payable for each Company Share represented by a Company Share
Certificate or for each Uncertificated Company Share. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Company Share Certificate or
Uncertificated Company Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive the Company Shares Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.09. If
any portion of the Company Shares Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company Share
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Company Share is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (A) either such Company Share
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Company Share shall be properly
transferred and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Share
Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share or establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Series A Preferred Shares at the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Series A Preferred Share Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. Each holder of Series A Preferred
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Series A
Preferred Shares Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Series A Preferred Share Certificate,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the Series A
Preferred Shares Merger Consideration payable for each Series A Preferred
Share represented by a Series A Preferred Share Certificate. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

  

  

case may be, each such Series A Preferred Share Certificate shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Series
A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares payable pursuant to Section 2.09. If any portion of the Series A
Preferred Shares Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Series A Preferred Share Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Series A
Preferred Share Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of
such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Series A
Preferred Share Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

  

  

(d) All Company Shares Merger Consideration and Series A Preferred Shares
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Company Share Certificates or
Uncertificated Company Shares and Series A Preferred Share Certificates,
respectively, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such certificates or
Uncertificated Company Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Share Certificates, Uncertificated Company Shares or Series A
Preferred Share Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Company Shares Merger Consideration or
the Series A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration, as applicable, provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. The
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting part of the Company Shares Merger
Consideration and the Series A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration, at
Parent's option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is otherwise required under Applicable Law. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the Company Shares Merger Consideration or the Series A
Preferred Shares Merger Consideration.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Company Shares Merger Consideration or Series A
Preferred Shares Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon,
which shall inure solely to the benefit of Parent) that remains unclaimed by
the holders of Company Shares or Series A Preferred Shares six months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged such Company Shares or Series A Preferred Shares
for the Company Shares Merger Consideration or Series A Preferred Shares
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Company Shares Merger
Consideration or Series A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration in respect of
such Company Shares or Series A Preferred Shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
Company Shares or Series A Preferred Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Share with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Share until such
holder shall surrender such Share in accordance with this Article 2. After the
surrender of any such Share in accordance with this Article 2, such holder
thereof entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, with a record date after the Effective Time and which theretofore had
become payable with respect to whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
such holder in respect of such Share.

  

  

Section 2.04 . Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, Company Shares
and Series A Preferred Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has neither voted in favor of this Agreement nor
consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such
Company Shares or Series A Preferred Shares in accordance with Delaware Law
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Company Shares Merger
Consideration or Series A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration, as
applicable, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Company Shares or
Series A Preferred Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Company Shares Merger
Consideration or Series A Preferred Shares Merger Consideration, as
applicable. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Company Shares or Series A Preferred
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

  

  

Section 2.05 . Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each option (the "Company Stock Options") and
each Restricted Stock Unit (the "Company RSUs" and, together with the Company
Stock Options, the "Company Compensatory Awards") outstanding under any
employee or director stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the
Company (a "Company Stock Incentive Plan"), whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall be canceled as described below.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option
shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of any such Company
Stock Option at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such Company
Stock Option an amount of cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock derived
from the Company Shares Merger Consideration determined by multiplying (x) the
excess, if any, (the "Excess") of the Company Shares Merger Consideration over
the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option (which Excess shall
be determined by first reducing the Company Share Cash Consideration by the
exercise price of such Company Stock Option and, if the exercise price of such
Company Stock Option exceeds the Company Share Cash Consideration (the amount
of such excess, the "Exercise Excess"), by then reducing the Company Share
Stock Consideration by the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (or
fraction thereof) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Exercise
Excess by the Market Price per share of Parent Common Stock) by (y) the number
of Company Shares such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of
Company Stock Options) had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in
full immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that, if the exercise
price of any such option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Amount,
such option shall be canceled without any payment being made in respect
thereof; provided, further, that in the case of the Selected Company
Performance Stock Options, the amount of any Excess that would have been paid
in cash pursuant to the foregoing shall instead be paid in that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (I) the amount of any such Excess that would have been paid in cash
by (II) the Market Price per share of Parent Common Stock (unless, as a result
of this second proviso and/or the proviso to Section 2.05(c), Parent would be
issuing an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Article 2 that would require a vote of Parent's stockholders under the rules
of the NASDAQ (as determined by Parent in good faith), in which case Parent
shall reduce the amount of shares of Parent Common Stock that would be payable
pursuant to this second proviso and the proviso to Section 2.05(c) so as to no
longer be subject to such requirement). Amounts payable pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be reduced by such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent is required to deduct and withhold pursuant to
Section 2.07. At the direction of Parent, payment of any cash amounts to be
paid pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) may be made through the Company's (or
the Surviving Corporation's) payroll.

  

  

(c) Company RSUs will be canceled at or immediately prior to the Effective
Time and, in lieu thereof, the holders of such Company RSUs shall be entitled
to receive payment of cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock derived from
the Company Shares Merger Consideration promptly following the Effective Time
of an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of Company Shares subject to such Company RSUs

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

  

  

by (y) the Company Shares Merger Consideration; provided that, in the case of
the Selected Company Performance RSUs, the portion of the foregoing
consideration that would be paid in cash (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
consists of the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of
Company Shares subject to such Selected Company Performance RSUs by (B) the
Company Share Cash Consideration) shall instead be paid in that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (I) the amount of the aggregate Company Share Cash Consideration that
would be paid pursuant to the foregoing by (II) the Market Price per share of
Parent Common Stock (unless, as a result of this proviso and/or the second
proviso to Section 2.05(b), Parent would be issuing an aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2 that would require a
vote of Parent's stockholders under the rules of the NASDAQ (as determined by
Parent in good faith), in which case Parent shall reduce the amount of shares
of Parent Common Stock that would be payable pursuant to this proviso and the
second proviso to Section 2.05(b) so as to no longer be subject to such
requirement). Amounts payable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
reduced by such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent is required to deduct and withhold pursuant to Section 2.07. At the
direction of Parent, payment of any cash amounts to be paid pursuant to this
Section 2.05(c) may be made through the Company's (or the Surviving
Corporation's) payroll.

 

  

  

(d) The parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a
Company Compensatory Award or any participant in any Company Stock Incentive
Plan, or Employee Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company under
any employment agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity
interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation. The amounts to
be paid to holders of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Selected Company
Performance Stock Options and Selected Company Performance RSUs pursuant to
Section 2.05 shall be subject to Section 2.09.

  

  

Section 2.06 . Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period, but excluding any change that results from any
exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock units outstanding as of
the date hereof granted under the Company's stock option or compensation plans
or arrangements), the Company Shares Merger Consideration, the Series A
Preferred Shares Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment, or stock dividend or other similar
change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made to the Company Share Stock Consideration and/or Preferred Share Stock
Consideration to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.02, as applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.07 . Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of Merger Subsidiary, the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Tax law. If Merger Subsidiary, the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which Merger
Subsidiary, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

  

Section 2.08 . Lost Certificates. If any Company Share Certificate or Series A
Preferred Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company
Share Certificate or Series A Preferred Share Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Company Share Certificate or Series A Preferred Share
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Share Certificate or Series A Preferred Share
Certificate, the Company Shares Merger Consideration or Series A Preferred
Shares Merger Consideration, as applicable, to be paid in respect of the
Company Shares or Series A Preferred Shares represented by such Company Share
Certificate or Series A Preferred Share Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article 2.

  

  

Section 2.09 . No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger or pursuant to Section 2.05(b) or
Section 2.05(c). Each holder of Company Shares or Series A Preferred Shares
who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Shares and/or Series A
Preferred Shares owned by such holder at the Effective Time to be converted
into Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2) shall be entitled to
receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.09, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares representing
such holder's proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by
the Exchange Agent (the "Proceeds") in one or more transactions of Parent
Common Stock equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

  

  

Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section
2.02(a) and Section 2.02(b) (such excess being the "Excess Shares"). The
parties acknowledge that payment of the cash Proceeds in lieu of issuing
certificates or scrip for fractional shares was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that otherwise would be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall sell the Excess Shares at then-
prevailing prices on the NASDAQ in the manner provided in this Section 2.09.
Until the Proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders
of Shares, or until the Company Shares Merger Consideration or Series A
Preferred Shares Merger Consideration is returned to Parent pursuant to
Section 2.03(e), the Exchange Agent shall hold such Proceeds in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the Proceeds to which each holder of Shares shall be entitled, if
any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate Proceeds by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which
is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of
Shares would otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
share.

Representations and Warranties of the Company

  

  

Subject to Section 11.05, except (i) as disclosed in the Company 10-K and in
any Company SEC Document filed since January 1, 2011, in each case, as filed
before the date of this Agreement (other than any information that is
contained under the captions "Risk Factors," "Statement Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements," "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk" of such Company SEC Document and any other forward-looking statements,
or other statements that are similarity predicative, cautionary or forward-
looking in nature, contained in such Company SEC Documents); provided that the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.10(ii),
4.20, 4.21 and 4.22 shall not be qualified by any information disclosed in any
such Company SEC Documents or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent that:

  

  

Section 4.01 . Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted. The Company has all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The certificate of
incorporation (including the Series A Certificate of Designation) and bylaws
of the Company incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Company 10-K as
filed prior to the date of this Agreement are true, correct and complete
copies of such documents as in full force and effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.02 . Corporate Authorization.

  

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
are within the Company's corporate powers and, except for the adoption of this
Agreement by the Company's stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of
the outstanding Shares, voting together as a single class (it being understood
that each holder of Series A Preferred Shares shall be entitled to cast a
number of votes per Series A Preferred Share as is equal to the number of
votes that such holder would be entitled to cast had such holder converted its
Series A Preferred Shares into Company Shares on the record date for such
vote, pursuant to the terms of the Series A Certificate

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

  

  

of Designation), to adopt this Agreement is the only vote of the holders of
any of the Company's capital stock necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). For the avoidance of doubt, by
reason of the waiver and consent set forth in Section 1.04 of the Voting
Agreement, no separate class vote of Series A Preferred Shares is required in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof
by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general application affecting or
relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and equitable
principles of general applicability, whether considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity.

 

  

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors has (i) unanimously determined that this
Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved and declared advisable
this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the Company's stockholders for their adoption and (iv)
unanimously resolved, subject to Section 6.04(b), to recommend that the
Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement (such recommendation, the "Company
Board Recommendation"), which determinations, approvals and resolutions have
not subsequently been rescinded or modified in any way.

  

  

Section 4.03 . Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act (iii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other applicable
state or federal securities laws (including, without limitation, the filing
with the SEC of the Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the filing and
declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4 in which the Company Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be included), (iv) compliance with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ and (v)
any other actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually, or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 4.04 . Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organization documents) of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred
to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a material
violation or material breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, require any
consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default under (or an
event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default),
or result in a modification, violation or breach of, increased liability under
or conflict with any provisions of, or give rise to a right of purchase
(including pursuant to any right of first refusal or the like), or cause or
permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any
right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement,
understanding, contract, note, bond, deed, mortgage, lease, sublease, license,
sublicense, undertaking or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such
exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (iii) and (iv), as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

  

Section 4.05. Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 125,000,000
Company Shares and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value,
including 50,000 authorized Series A Preferred Shares. As of the date of this
Agreement, there were outstanding 32,519,233 Company Shares, 50,000 Series A
Preferred Shares, Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of 9,487,744
Company Shares (with a weighted average exercise price of $9.96) and 1,458,125

Agreement, 7,440,476 Company Shares were reserved for issuance upon the
conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares, 3,752,305 Company Shares were
reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Incentive Plans (including upon
exercise of the Company Stock Options or the vesting of Company RSUs) and
7,682,962 Company Shares were held by the Company in its treasury. All
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been, and all shares
that may be issued pursuant to any employee stock option or other compensation
plan or arrangement, or upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares will
be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly
authorized and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable, and free of
preemptive or similar rights under its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
any agreement to which the Company is party or by which the Company is
otherwise bound. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes following the
date of this Agreement resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options or
the vesting and settlement of Company RSUs outstanding on the date of this
Agreement, there are no issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (i)
shares of capital stock of or other voting securities of or ownership
interests in the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or
ownership interests in the Company, (iii) subscriptions, warrants, calls,
options or other rights to acquire from the Company, or other obligation of
the Company to issue, any capital stock or other voting securities or
ownership interests in or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for
capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in the Company
or (iv) restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units,
contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights that
are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly,

Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to collectively
as the "Company Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of the Company Securities. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any
Company Securities. Schedule 4.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list as of the date of this Agreement of (i) the
name of or other identifying information with respect to each holder of a
Company Compensatory Award, including, for each such holder and award (as
applicable) (i) the number of Company Shares covered by such award (vested and
unvested), (ii) the date of grant, (iii) the expiration date, and (iv) the
exercise price. Each Company Stock Option (1) was granted in compliance with
all Applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Company Stock
Incentive Plans pursuant to which it was issued, (2) has an exercise price per
Company Share equal to or greater than the fair market value of a Company
Share on the date of such grant, and (3) qualifies for the Tax and accounting
treatment afforded to such Company Stock Option in the Company's Tax Returns
and the Company SEC Documents, respectively.

  

  

(c) None of (i) the Shares or (ii) Company Securities are owned by any
Subsidiary of the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Company has not, during the period from December 31, 2010 to the date
of this Agreement, issued any Company Securities. By reason of the waiver and
consent set forth in Section 1.04 of the Voting Agreement, Section 4(c) of the
Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Shares is not
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4.06 . Subsidiaries.

  

  

(a) Each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized, is validly
existing and (where applicable) in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, has all organizational powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each such Subsidiary is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Schedule 4.06(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists, as of the date hereof, each direct and indirect Subsidiary of
the Company. Except for the Subsidiaries of the Company listed on Schedule
4.06(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the equity interests in the
Persons listed on Schedule 4.06(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company owns any capital stock
or other equity interests in any other Person.

  

  

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any limitations
on voting rights. As of the date of this Agreement, there were no issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of, or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary
of the Company, (ii) subscriptions, warrants, calls, options or other rights
to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligations
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or other
voting securities of, or ownership interests in, or any securities convertible
into, or exchangeable for, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) restricted
shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights,
"phantom" stock or similar securities or rights that are derivative of, or
provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price
of, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or ownership interests
in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii)
being referred to collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities"). There
are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary
Securities. There are no agreements requiring the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company to make contributions to the capital of, or lend or advance funds
to, any Subsidiary of the Company.

the date hereof, the "Company SEC Documents").

  

  

(b) As of its filing date (and as of the date of any amendment), each Company

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) The Company and each of its officers are in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Each

required to be filed or submitted by the Company's chief executive officer and

compliance with Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act, (i) designed and maintained
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the management of the Company by others within those entities, and
(ii) disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer prior to the date hereof, to the Company's
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors (A) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting ("Internal Controls") which would adversely affect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for the Company's auditors any material weaknesses in Internal
Controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's Internal
Controls and the Company has provided to Parent copies of any written
materials relating to the matters in each of the foregoing clauses (A) and
(B). Since December 31, 2009, no material complaints from any source regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns
from Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters,
have been received by the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a
summary of all material complaints since December 31, 2009, through the
Company's whistleblower hot line or equivalent system for receipt of employee
concerns regarding possible violations of law. None of Ernst and Young LLP and
all other independent public accountants of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company has resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountant of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as a result of or in connection
with any disagreement with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure. No attorney representing the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, whether or not employed by the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries of the Company, has reported evidence of a violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company
or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the
Company. There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of the Company.

  

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is subject to any
"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the 1933 Act).

at the time of the filing of such document or any supplement or amendment

the case of the Form S-4, at the time of the stockholder vote to adopt this
Agreement), will not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

  

  

(c) The representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.05 will not

Form S-4 based upon information supplied by the Company or any of its
representatives or advisors specifically for use or incorporation by reference

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.07 . Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of fully
executed commitment letter (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), dated as of April
27, 2011, by and between Parent and each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., confirming the commitments of the lender party
thereto to provide Parent with debt financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Debt Financing").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a valid and

have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect, other
than pursuant to the "Fee Letter" referred to therein (a true, correct and
complete copy of which has been made available to the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement, subject to the redaction of certain fee and market
flex provisions of such Fee Letter). As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
under the Debt Commitment Letter. Except for the payment of customary fees,
there are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the
Debt Financing other than the conditions precedent set forth in or
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, and as of the date hereof Parent
has no reason to believe that it will not be able to satisfy any term or
condition of closing of the Debt Financing that is required to be satisfied as
a condition of the Debt Financing, or that the Debt Financing will not be made
available to Parent prior to the consummation of the Merger. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, the aggregate proceeds of
the Debt Financing, if funded, together with available cash of the Parent, is

Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 6.04. No Solicitation; Other Offers.

  

  

(a) General Prohibitions. Neither the Company (or the Board of Directors) nor
any of the Company's Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other
agents or advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, induce, explore or knowingly take any action to facilitate
or encourage the submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiries, proposals or offers that may reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal (including through the furnishing of any information),
(ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
assist or facilitate any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent (or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent) the Company Board Recommendation (or approve, recommend, or
declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal) (any of the foregoing in this
clause (iii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (iv) approve, recommend,
declare advisable or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent,
term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal or requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), at any time prior to
obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, so long as none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their Representatives have breached or taken any action
inconsistent with the Company's obligations under Section 6.04(a):

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) subject to the required fiduciary determinations provided below, the
Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party and its Representatives or financing sources that has made after the
date of this agreement a bona fide written unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor would reasonably be expected
to constitute or result in a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to such Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (A)
or its Representatives or its financing sources non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for informational
purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party with terms no less favorable to
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (prior to
giving effect to Section 7.01); provided that all such information (to the
extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such Third Party) and (C) take any nonappealable, final
action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take;

  

  

(ii) subject to the required fiduciary determinations and compliance with the
Notice Period and other related provisions provided below, the Board of
Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (A) in connection with a
bona fide written unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (that did not arise out of
a breach of this Section 6.04) that the Board of Directors concludes in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) in connection with an Intervening
Event; and

  

  

(iii) subject to the required fiduciary determinations and compliance with the
Notice Period and other related provisions provided below, the Company may
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
a bona fide written unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (that did not arise out
of a breach of this Section 6.04) that the Board of Directors concludes in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (a "Superior Proposal
Termination"); provided that concurrently with such Superior Proposal
Termination the Company pays the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to
Section 11.04 and enters into such definitive agreement and, provided further
that any purported termination pursuant to this clause (iii) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company
pays the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 11.04 and
otherwise complies with the provisions of this Section 6.04;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) ONLY IF
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and, further, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii), ONLY IF, prior to effecting any Adverse Recommendation Change
or Superior Proposal Termination (1) the Company notifies Parent in writing,
at least five Business Days prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation
Change or Superior Proposal Termination (the "Notice Period"), of its
intention to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal
Termination (which notice shall, if in connection with (ii)(A) or (iii),
include the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, the identity of
the Third Party, and a copy of the most recent draft of any written agreement
relating thereto (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment
to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice Period of at
least two Business Days), or, if in connection with an Intervening Event,
shall include reasonable detail regarding the Intervening Event), (2) during
the applicable Notice Period the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Superior Proposal ceases
to be a Superior Proposal or the Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
the Intervening Event is no longer necessary, as applicable and (3) at the end
of the Notice Period, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that such
Superior Proposal continues to meet the definition of "Superior Proposal" or
the Intervening Event continues to necessitate an Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable.

  

  

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so
comply is consistent with this Section 6.04; provided that any such action
taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection
with such action or (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934
Act.

  

  

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions
referred to in Section 6.04 unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent
a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action. In
addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal, including of the material terms and conditions thereof,
and shall, at Parent's request, keep Parent informed on a reasonably current
basis as to the status (including changes to the material terms) of such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

  

  

promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company of
any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may
be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal.

 

  

  

(d) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for at
least a majority of the outstanding Company Shares on an as-converted basis or
all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a
majority vote, after considering the advice of outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, is (A) at least as favorable,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Shares as the
Company Shares Merger Consideration (disregarding the aspects and risks set
forth in the parenthetical in the following clause (B)) and (B) on more
favorable terms to the holders of Company Shares than the Merger taking into
account all financial, legal, financing (including availability thereof),
regulatory and other aspects and risks (including required conditions
(including any requirement of a stockholder vote of the party making the
Acquisition Proposal) and likelihood and timing of consummation).

  

  

(e) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions; Other. The
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees, except in the
case that that Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that such action is required for the Board of
Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, to not
release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the
waiver of, any "standstill" provision in any agreement to which the Company is
a party.

  

  

(f) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with,
Section 10.01, (i) the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and to hold a vote of the
Company's stockholders on the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the
Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or by an Adverse Recommendation
Change, and (ii) in any case in which the Company makes an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.04, (A) the Company shall
nevertheless submit this Agreement and the Merger to a vote of its
stockholders and (B) the Company Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any and all
accompanying materials may include appropriate disclosure with respect to such
Adverse Recommendation Change.

ARTICLE 7

  

  

  

Covenants of Parent

  

  

Parent agrees that:

  

  

Section 7.01 . Confidentiality. Parent acknowledges that the Confidentiality
Agreement remains in full force and effect from and after the date hereof;
provided that, from and after the date hereof, the obligations of Parent with
respect to the Standstill Period (as such term is defined therein) shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect. The Company acknowledges that
the Form S-4 will require the disclosure of certain information that may be
confidential under the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Company
hereby waives the restrictions under the Confidentiality Agreement in respect
of such disclosure.

  

  

Section 7.02 . Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement to consummate the Merger on (and subject to) the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.03 . Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all Company Shares
beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of
this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  

  

Section 7.04 . Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

  

  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or agreement of any Indemnified Person
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the
date hereof; provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law. Subject to
Applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur
in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
7.04. The Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement of any
matter for which the Surviving Company may have an obligation to indemnify an
Indemnified Person that is effected by an Indemnified Person

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

  

  

without the Surviving Company's written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). Subject to Applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay on an as-incurred basis the fees and expenses of such Indemnified
Person (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in advance of
the final disposition of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that is
the subject of the right to indemnification, provided that such Person shall
undertake to reimburse the Surviving Corporation for all amounts so advanced
if a court of competent jurisdiction determines, by a final, nonappealable
order, that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

  

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the noncancellable extension of
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby), provided that, the Company shall not, without the prior consent of
Parent, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not be obligated to, expend an
amount for such extension in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the
Company paid for its DandO Insurance in the last full fiscal year, which amount
is set forth on Schedule 7.04(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If the
Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with the Company's current

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

  

  

insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase from the Company's current insurance carrier or
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than as
provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof; provided
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in
excess of 200% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full
fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Schedule 7.04(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and provided further that if the aggregate premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 

  

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.04.

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

  

  

Section 7.05. Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) From the Effective Time until a period of one year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide to all employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continue employment with the Company
or any of its Affiliates after the Effective Time or the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Affiliates after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
with (i) base salary or base wages that are no less than the base salary or
base wages provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) annual cash bonus opportunity and other compensation
and benefits (other than equity incentive arrangements) that are in the
aggregate substantially comparable to such annual cash bonus opportunity and
other compensation and benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Except as would result in the duplication of benefits, with respect to any
compensation and/or benefit program, policy or arrangement maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in
which any Continuing Employee becomes a participant, such Continuing Employee
shall receive full credit (for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, and, except for any defined benefit plan, benefit level and accrual,
where applicable under the compensation and/or benefit programs, policies or
arrangements of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), for service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the
Company provides such past service credit).

  

  

(c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
in which the Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) are eligible
to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that
such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under
the comparable plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Employee participated. If a Continuing Employee commences
participation in any health benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
after the commencement of a calendar year, to the extent commercially
practicable, Parent shall cause such plan to recognize the dollar amount of
all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during such calendar year for
purposes of satisfying such calendar year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing
Employee (and dependents) commences participation.

  

  

(d) From the Effective Time and for a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
applicable employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who suffers a
termination of employment under the circumstances described on Schedule
7.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule severance benefits no less
favorable than as set forth in Schedule 7.05(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (taking into account such Company Employee's service as required
pursuant to Section 7.05(b) above).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.05 shall obligate Parent to employ any person
for any period of time, and this Section 7.05 shall not be construed to limit
the ability of Parent to alter the terms and conditions of, or terminate, the
employment of any person. Nothing in this Section 7.05 shall be construed as
giving any Person (including any Continuing Employee or dependent or
beneficiary thereof) any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Section 7.05.

  

  

Section 7.06 . Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall, to the extent required by
NASDAQ, use its best efforts to list, prior to Closing, the Parent Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger on NASDAQ.

necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 8.02, Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to (i) prepare, as soon as practicable, all filings and other
presentations in connection with seeking any regulatory approval, exemption or
other authorization from any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) prosecute such filings and other
presentations with diligence; and (iii) oppose any objections to, appeals from
or petitions to reconsider or reopen any such approval by Persons not party to
this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
furnish all information in connection with the approvals of or filings with
any Governmental Authority and shall promptly cooperate with and furnish
information in connection with any such requirements imposed upon Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to Section 8.02, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, and to remove any impediment imposed by any Governmental
Authority to allow the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent and the Company shall each advise the other party promptly of any
material communication received by such party or any of its Affiliates from
the Federal trade commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), any state attorney general or any other
governmental authority regarding any of the transactions

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

  

  

contemplated hereby, and of any understandings, undertakings or agreements
(oral or written) such party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the
DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Company shall
each consult with the other in advance of any material meetings with the FTC,
the DOJ, any state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority and to
the extent permitted by the FTC or DOJ or any other Governmental Authority,
give the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Parent will
determine strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate all activities with
respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any
Governmental Authority as contemplated hereby, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries will take such actions as reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with obtaining such approval, exemption or other authorization.

 

  

  

Section 8.02 . HSR Clearance.

  

  

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of Section 8.01, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and thereafter make any other required submissions
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act and
shall use reasonable best efforts to take all other appropriate actions
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly use reasonable best
efforts to take, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
all actions necessary to (i) secure the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and (ii) resolve any objections
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement by
the FTC or DOJ or any other Governmental Authority, to prevent the entry of
any court order and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including (A) executing settlements, undertakings, consent decrees,
stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, (but
only in the latter case in order to vacate, lift, reverse, overturn, settle or
otherwise resolve any decree, judgment, injunction or other order that
prevents, prohibits, restricts or delays the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby that may be issued by any court or other Governmental
Authority in favor of that Person), (B) selling, divesting or otherwise
conveying or holding separate particular assets or categories of assets or
businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (C) agreeing to sell, divest or
otherwise convey or hold separate any particular assets or categories of
assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously
with or subsequent to the Effective

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

  

  

Time, (D) permitting the Company to sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold
separate any of the particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, or (E)
effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or
stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications
with the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and, in the case of actions
by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their
businesses or assets, by consenting to such action by the Company (each a
"Divestiture Action"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything otherwise
contained in this Agreement that may be to the contrary, (1) neither Parent
nor the Company shall be required to take any Divestiture Action that is not
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger, (2) the Company shall not agree
to take any Divestiture Action without the consent of Parent, (3) none of
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be required to take or accept (or commit
to take or accept) any action, condition, restriction, obligation or
requirement (collectively, for purposes of this Section, "actions") in order
to obtain any approval, exemption or other authorization of a Governmental
Authority involving any business or asset of Parent or its Affiliates that
would otherwise be required by Section 8.01 or this Section 8.02 unless there
is no action (including a Divestiture Action) that would permit such approval,
exemption or other authorization of a Governmental Authority to be obtained
that involves solely businesses or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and to which Parent is required by Section 8.01 or this Section 8.02, or is
otherwise willing in Parent's sole discretion, to agree, and (4) Parent shall
not be required to take (pursuant to Section 8.01, this Section 8.02(b) or any
other provision of this Agreement) any action (including a Divestiture Action)
to the extent such action (including a Divestiture Action), individually or in
the aggregate with all other actions (including Divestiture Actions), would
reasonably be expected to result in a Substantial Detriment. "Substantial
Detriment" means (i) any material limitation, restriction or prohibition on
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries effectively to acquire, hold
or exercise full rights of ownership (including with respect to voting) of the
Shares or shares of the Surviving Corporation to be acquired or owned pursuant
to the Merger or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) a loss

Section 11.05 . Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References.

  

  

(a) The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Schedule of
either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) (x) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding
Section of this Agreement and (y) any other representations and warranties of
such party that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of
that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable
person who has read that reference and such representations and warranties,
without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the
matter(s) so disclosed; provided that disclosure in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall only be an exception to, or disclosure for the purposes of,
Section 4.10(ii) of this Agreement to the extent specifically referenced on
Schedule 4.10(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The mere inclusion of an
item in either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty (i) shall not be
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material
fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, as
applicable and (ii) shall not be construed as an admission by the disclosing
party of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party rights
(including but not limited to any intellectual property rights) or any law,
regulation, order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority, such
disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of creating exceptions to
the representations made herein or of disclosing any information required to
be disclosed under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of any
Company SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) the Company's representations and warranties if
the relevance of that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent
to a person who has read that information concurrently with such
representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part
of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as
provided in Section 7.04, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.04,

of Section 11.08, and each such Person shall be entitled to enforce its rights
under such provision.

obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time; provided that such

obligations under this Agreement or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of
any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

  

  

Section 11.08 . Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Chancery Court") or, if such
court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source, or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction
located within the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York,
whether a state or federal court, and that the provisions of Section 11.09
relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

HEREBY.

  

  

Section 11.10 . Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

  

  

Section 11.11 . Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with

Section 11.12 . Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction,
any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.
