EFFECT OF THE MERGER

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holder of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by
the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned Company Subsidiary or by
Parent or by any Parent Subsidiary shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 3.2_) shall automatically
be converted into the right to receive 2.129 common shares of Parent (the "
_Parent Common Shares_ ") (such number of Parent Common Shares, the "
_Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 3.2_ (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). All shares of Company Common Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") or book-entry share registered in the transfer books of the
Company (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with _Section 3.3_, including
the right, if any, to receive, pursuant to _Section 3.8_, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Shares into which such shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this _Section 3.1(b)_,
together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_.

 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Securities_. All issued and outstanding shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Common Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one fully-paid and nonassesable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Entity.

 

(d) _Parent Common Shares_. Each share of Parent Common Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following
the Effective Time.

Section 3.2 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement and subject to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ and _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the Company should split, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Company Common Stock, or make a distribution in Company Common Stock, or
otherwise change the Company Common Stock into any other securities (including
any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Parent
Common Shares), or engage in a reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or exchange or other like change, then (without limiting any
other rights of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder), the Exchange Ratio shall be
ratably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any such change and any
Phantom Share Payment to be received in the form of Parent Common Shares (each
such payment, a " _Stock Award Payment_ ") shall be ratably adjusted to
reflect any such change. Without limiting the other provisions of this 

 



17  Agreement and subject to _Section 6.2(b)(i)_ and _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, Parent should split, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Parent Common Shares, or make a distribution in Parent Common Shares, or
otherwise change the Parent Common Shares into other securities (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common
Shares), or engage in a reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or
exchange or other like change, then the Exchange Ratio and all Stock Award
Payments shall be ratably adjusted to reflect any such change. In addition,
the Exchange Ratio and all Stock Award Payments shall be subject to adjustment
as provided in _Schedule 3.2_.

 

Section 3.3 _Exchange Fund; Exchange Agent_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration,
the Stock Award Payments and the Fractional Share Consideration, as provided
in _Section 3.1(b)_, _Section 3.3_ and  _Section 3.8_. On or before the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent (i) the shares of Parent Common Shares sufficient to pay the
Merger Consideration and the Stock Award Payments, and (ii) cash in
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the Fractional
Share Consideration (such shares of Parent Common Shares and cash amounts, the
" _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ," and such Aggregate Merger Consideration
as deposited with the Exchange Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case,
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, In-The-Money
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and shares of Company
Restricted Stock, and Company Phantom Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.8_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency
in the amount required to make such payments, without interest. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, payments
of the Merger Consideration, amounts in respect of In-The-Money Company
Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, shares of Company Restricted Stock
and Company Phantom Shares and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or
distributions on shares of Parent Common Shares in accordance with _Section
3.3(d)_ or otherwise payable pursuant to _Section 3.8_ out of the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest
earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to Parent.

(b) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, persons who held shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Entity for any reason shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock, formerly
represented thereby.

 



18 (c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent or the Surviving Entity
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection
by hand) (A) to each holder of record of a Certificate evidencing Company
Common Stock, (x) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "),
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent,
and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as the Surviving Entity may reasonably specify, and (y)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any amounts payable
in respect of dividends or distributions on shares of Parent Common Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ (which instructions shall provide that, at
the election of the surrendering holder, (1) Certificates may be surrendered
by hand delivery or otherwise or (2) the Merger Consideration in exchange
therefor, together with any amounts payable in respect of dividends or
distributions on shares of Parent Common Shares in accordance with _Section
3.3(d)_, may be collected by hand by the surrendering holder or by check or
wire transfer to the surrendering holder), (B) to each holder of an In-The-
Money Company Option, written evidence representing an option to acquire
shares of Parent Common Shares in an amount due and payable to such holder
pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ in respect of such Company Option, (C) to each
holder of a share of Company Restricted Stock, shares of Parent Common Shares
in an amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to  _Section 3.4(b)_ in
respect of such share of Company Restricted Stock, and (D) to each holder of a
Company Phantom Share, shares of Parent Common Shares in an amount due and
payable to such holder pursuant to  _Section 3.4(b)_ in respect of such
Company Phantom Share.

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Exchange Agent or Parent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article III_ plus any cash such holder
is entitled to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Shares
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 3.1(b)_ and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive
in respect of dividends or distributions on shares of Parent Common Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_, to be mailed, made available for collection
by hand or delivered by wire transfer, within two (2) Business Days following
the later to occur of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the Exchange Agents
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss 

 



19  in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.3_, each Certificate shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time,
to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_. No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates.

(iii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent or the Surviving
Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent (A) to issue to each holder of Book-
Entry Shares that number of uncertificated whole shares of Parent Common
Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_
in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, and (B) to issue and deliver to each
holder of Book-Entry Shares a check or wire transfer for any amounts payable
in respect of dividends or distributions on shares of Parent Common Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ and any other amount such holder is entitled
to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Shares that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section
3.1(b)_, in each case, without such holder being required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and
such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Book-Entry Shares.

 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate surrendered in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 3.3(c)_ shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, or any Book-Entry Share shall
be properly transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer Taxes and other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(v) All shares of Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger will be
issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates.

(d) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Shares issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by
Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Following surrender of any
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid
to the holder thereof in addition to the other amounts payable hereunder

 



20  (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Shares to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Shares.

(e)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration to which they are
entitled under this  _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Entity for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or
Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such
investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the
payments required by this _Article III_ and, to the extent that there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments
or other events, without interest, so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is,
at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments, (ii) no
such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in
short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments,
shall be property of, and paid to, Parent.

Section 3.4 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units; Restricted Stock; Phantom
Shares_. All of the provisions of this _Section 3.4_ shall be effectuated
without any action on the part of the holder of any Company Option, Company
Restricted Stock and/or Company Phantom Shares.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each In-The-Money
Company Option which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether

 



21  or not then vested or exercisable) shall become vested and exercisable and
shall thereafter be assumed by Parent and shall otherwise continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were applicable
immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth in the applicable Company
Plan (including any applicable award agreement, other agreement or other
document evidencing such Company Option) immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that, from and after the Effective Time, (i) each such In-The-
Money Company Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole number) of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such In-The-Money Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (y) the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such assumed In-The-
Money Company Option will be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) determined by dividing (x) the exercise price of each share of
Company Common Stock at which such assumed In-The-Money Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio.
Any Company Option outstanding as of the Effective Time that has an exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the
per share dollar value of the Merger Consideration immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and forfeited for no
consideration without any further action on the part of the holder of such
Company Option, and all rights with respect to such Company Option shall
terminate as of the Effective Time.

(b)  _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time,
each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and shall otherwise continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions, including vesting
terms, as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth
in the applicable Company Plan (including any applicable award agreement,
other agreement or other document evidencing such Company Restricted Stock
Unit) immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, from and after the
Effective Time, each such Company Restricted Stock Unit will be converted into
a number of restricted stock units covering that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Unit as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

(c) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share
of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and shall otherwise continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions, including applicable
restrictions and vesting terms, as were applicable immediately prior to the
Effective Time as set forth in the applicable Company Plan (including any
applicable award agreement, other agreement or other document evidencing such
awards of Company Restricted Stock) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that, from and after the Effective Time, each such share of Company
Restricted Stock will be converted into a number of restricted shares of
Parent Common Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Restricted Stock as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

 



22 (d) _Treatment of Company Phantom Shares_. Each Company Phantom Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
and all restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and each such Company Phantom Share shall be converted into an
amount, payable in cash, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Phantom Share and (ii) the
difference between (x) the per share dollar value of the Merger Consideration
and (y) the applicable "exercise price" for such Company Phantom Share (the "
_Phantom Share Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, each holder of Company
Phantom Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Phantom Share Payment. Any Company Phantom Share
outstanding as of the Effective Time that has an exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the per share dollar
value of the Merger Consideration shall automatically be cancelled and
forfeited for no consideration without any further action on the part of the
holder of such Company Phantom Share, and all rights with respect to such
Company Phantom Share shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

(e) _Company Assumed Awards_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following
the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of an In-The-Money
Company Option, Company Restricted Stock Unit and share of Company Restricted
Stock an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant to
such In-The-Money Company Option, Company Restricted Stock Unit or share of
Company Restricted Stock, as applicable. Unless the shares of Parent Common
Shares issuable upon exercise or settlement of the In-The-Money Company
Option or upon vesting of the Company Restricted Stock Unit or share of
Company Restricted Stock are otherwise covered by an existing registration
statement on Form S-8 immediately upon the Effective Time, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC such a registration statement with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Shares no later than the Effective Time and
Parent shall exercise reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement for so long as such In-The-Money Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock Units and shares of Company Restricted Stock remain
outstanding (subject to blackout periods and similar restrictions in
accordance with Parents policies). The Company and its counsel shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of any such
registration statement.

 

(f) _Manner of Effecting_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
agree that the Company shall, and shall be permitted under this Agreement to
take all corporate action necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 3.4_. From and after the Effective Time, unless the compensation
committee of the Parent Board determines otherwise, all references to
the Company in the Company Plans and in each award or other agreement
evidencing or relating to any In-The-Money Company Options, Company Restricted
Stock Units, Company Restricted Stock or Company Phantom Shares or any other
Company equity-based award, shall be deemed (i) for all purposes relating to
employment, consultancy or directorship (or words of similar meaning) to refer
to Parent and its Subsidiaries and (ii) for all other purposes, to refer to
Parent.

 

Section 3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock Units, shares of Company 

 



23  Restricted Stock and Company Phantom Shares, such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

Section 3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article III_.

Section 3.7 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, so long as the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL are
applicable to the transaction.

 

Section 3.8 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or with respect to Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Shares shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part
of a share of Parent Common Shares multiplied by the VWAP of Parent Common
Shares.

therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, no Company Subsidiary is separately subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

its consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited

Company and the principal financial officer of the Company has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Filings.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The records, systems, controls, data and information
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of

ownership and direct control of the Company or the Company

 



31  Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1)
transactions are executed only in accordance with managements authorization;
(2) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the

Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with

timely basis. The Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any known
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls, and the
Company has made available to Parent copies of any material written materials
relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company required to be included in
reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in the Companys periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any
director or executive officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 

(d) None of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly contemplated
by or under this Agreement, including without limitation _Section 6.1_
hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

(c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of CWI that are owned
directly or indirectly by Parent, and all of the outstanding shares of

limited liability

 



45  company are duly authorized and validly issued. All shares of capital stock
of (or other ownership interests in) each of the Parent Subsidiaries (other

exchange rights are duly authorized and, upon issuance will be validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable.

 

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3_, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights,
commitments, agreements, rights of first refusal, arrangements or undertakings
of any kind to which Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them is bound, obligating Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Parent Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell or create, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold or created, additional shares of Parent Stock or

contractual rights the value of which is determined in whole or in part by
the value of any equity security of Parent, Merger Sub or any of the other
Parent Subsidiaries or obligating Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent
Subsidiary to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option,
warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, right of first refusal,

Parent Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
Parent Stock, or other equity securities or interests of Parent, Merger Sub or
any other Parent Subsidiary (other than in satisfaction of withholding Tax
obligations pursuant to certain awards outstanding under the Parent Benefit
Plans). Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Parent Subsidiary is a party
to or bound by any agreements or understandings concerning the voting
(including voting trusts and proxies) of any Merger Sub Common Shares or
capital stock of Parent, or equity interests in any of the other Parent
Subsidiaries.

Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the

of termination, acceleration or cancellation (with or without notice or the
lapse of time or both) of, or give rise to any right of purchase, first offer

Lease, license, permit or other legally binding obligation to which Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary is a party, except, as to clauses

effectiveness of the Form F-4, and (B) such reports under, and other

failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full force
and effect of, any of the Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate,

49 Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Canadian Filings; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to,
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to
be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after January 1, 2013 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each
Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its
date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did
not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of registration
statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most
recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
of this Agreement, neither Merger Sub nor any other Parent Subsidiary is
separately subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act.

(b) Each of Parents consolidated financial statements contained or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented
or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was
prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the provisions of the Exchange Act and Securities
Act relating thereto which under the terms of such provisions (including the
dates by which such compliance is required) have become applicable to Parent.
Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal
financial officer of Parent has made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder with respect to the Parent SEC Filings. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any
non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with
managements authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to 

 



50  permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of the Parent Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any known
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls, and Parent has made
available to the Company copies of any material written materials relating to
the foregoing. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent
required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parents periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited
loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

 

(d) None of Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, including without limitation _Section
6.2_ hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Parent SEC
Filings made through and including the date of this Agreement, (iii) described
in any section of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) To the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject
of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any comments from the SEC
with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings since January 1, 2013 which
remains unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information request
from the SEC as to any matters affecting Parent which has not been adequately
addressed. Parent has made available to the Company true and complete copies
of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since
January 1, 2013 through the date of this Agreement relating to the Parent SEC
Filings and all written responses of Parent thereto through the date of this
Agreement. None of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject of any confidential
treatment request by Parent.

(f) Parent has timely filed all reports, registrations, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents, together with any amendments required to be
made with respect

 



51  thereto, including all reports, schedules, registration statements or other
documents that it was required to file since January 1, 2013 with the TSX, the
Canadian provincial securities commissions (collectively, the " _Canadian
Securities Commissions_ "), or with other Governmental Authorities or pursuant
to applicable federal, state or provincial securities Laws (the " _Parent
Canadian Filings_ "), and has paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except in each case where the failure to file such
report, registration, schedule, form, statement or other document, or to pay
such fees and assessments, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No publicly
available final registration statement, prospectus, report, form, schedule,
release or proxy material (including any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein) filed since January 1, 2013 and
prior to the close of business on the date hereof by Parent with the Canadian
Securities Commissions or pursuant to the applicable securities Laws of the
provinces of Canada and the respective regulations and rules made thereunder,
including the regulations and rules of the TSX, together with all applicable
published policy statements, notices, blanket orders and rulings and all
discretionary orders or rulings, if any, of the Canadian Securities
Commissions and the TSX (collectively, " _Canadian Securities Laws_ ")
(collectively, the " _Parent Securities Documents_ "), as of their respective
dates or, if amended or superseded prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of such amendment or applicable subsequent filing, contained a
misrepresentation (as defined under Canadian Securities Laws). As of their
respective filing dates, or if amended or superseded prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment or applicable
subsequent filing, all Parent Securities Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of Canadian Securities
Laws. Parent and its Subsidiaries are engaged in all material respects only in
the business described in the Parent SEC Filings and the Parent Canadian
Filings contain a complete and accurate description in all material respects
of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Parent has
not filed any confidential material change report with any Canadian Securities
Commissions which as of the date hereof remains confidential.

 

Section 5.8 _Disclosure Documents_.

 

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form F-4 will, at the time such
document is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended or
supplemented or at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, (ii) the Circular will, at the time such document is filed
with the applicable Canadian Securities Commissions, at any time such

the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) the Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, at the time

effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. All documents that
Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein, to 

 



52  the extent relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other information
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for inclusion
therein, will comply as to form, in all material respects, with the
provisions of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, as applicable and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder and each such document required to be
filed with any Governmental Authority (other than the SEC) will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of any applicable Law as to the
information required to be contained therein.

(b) The representations and warranties contained in this _Section 5.8_ will
not apply to statements or omissions included in the Form F-4 or the Proxy
Statement to the extent based upon information supplied to Parent by or on
behalf of the Company.

Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since June 30, 2015,
except as contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in _Section 5.9_ of
the Parent Disclosure Letter, (a) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has
conducted its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice,
(b), neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has taken any action that
it would not be permitted to take after the date of this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the Company pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)(i)_,
_Section 6.2(b)(ii)_, or _ Section 6.2(b)(vii)_, or agreed to do any of the
foregoing, and (c) there has not been any Parent Material Adverse Effect or
any effect, event, development or circumstance that, individually or in the
aggregate with all other effects, events, developments and changes, would
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.10  _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Section 5.10(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each material Parent Benefit Plan. Each Parent Benefit Plan
has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms
and applicable Laws.

 

(b) Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code has either received, or may rely upon, a favorable determination
or opinion letter from the IRS as to its qualified status and, to Parents
Knowledge, no event has occurred that could be reasonably expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Parent Benefit Plan. To
Parents Knowledge, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that
could result in material liability to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. No material suit, administrative proceeding, action or other
litigation has been brought, or to the Knowledge of Parent, is threatened
against or with respect to any such Parent Benefit Plan (other than routine
benefits claims) and no such Parent Benefit Plan is under audit or
investigation by any Governmental Authority.

 

(c) None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates,
has or could reasonably be expected to have material liability in connection
with: (i) an employee pension benefit plan subject to Title IV or Section 302
of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), a "multiple employer
plan" (as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code) or a Multiemployer Plan,
(iii) any plan or arrangement which provides post-employment retiree medical
or welfare benefits, except as required by applicable Law.

 



53 (d) Except as set forth in _Section 5.10(d)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in conjunction with another
event, will: (A) accelerate the time of payment, vesting or funding or result
in any payment of compensation or benefits to any current or former employee,
officer, director or other service provider of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary; (B) give rise to any payment or benefit that, individually or in
combination with any other such payment or benefit, will or may be made by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to any of their current or former employees or
other service providers that could reasonably be expected to be characterized
as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code; (C) result in payments or benefits which would not be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code; or (D) result in any severance or other payment
becoming due, or increase the amount of any compensation or benefits due, to
any current or former employee, officer, director, consultant or other service
provider of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. No Person is entitled to receive
any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment) from
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary as a result of the imposition of the excise
taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code or any taxes required by Section
409A of the Code.

 

Section 5.11 _Labor and Other Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to a
collective bargaining agreement or similar agreement (other than national
labor contracts). As of the date of this Agreement and except as would not
reasonable be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, with respect
to employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) there is no labor-
related strike, walkout or lockout pending or, to Parents Knowledge,
threatened in writing, and (ii) there is no pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened union organizing campaign and no labor union has made a
pending written demand for recognition or certification.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i)
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Laws relating to
the hiring of employees and the employment of labor, including all such Laws
relating to fair employment practices, employment discrimination, terms and
conditions of employment, workers compensation, occupational safety and
health, overtime, wages and hours, plant closures and layoffs, worker
classification and immigration, and (ii) there is no charge, complaint,
lawsuit or other proceeding pending, or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries before any Governmental
Authority brought by or on behalf of any current or former employee or any
class of the foregoing, alleging breach of any express or implied contract of
employment, any applicable Law governing employment or the termination thereof
or other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection with the
employment relationship. 

Section 5.12 _Material Contracts_. All Parent Material Contracts have been
filed as exhibits to the Parent SEC Filings or included in the Parent
Canadian Filings, as the case may be, made through and including the date of
this Agreement. Each Parent Material Contract is in full force and effect and
is valid, binding and enforceable against Parent and/or any Parent Subsidiary
party thereto, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto in
accordance with its terms, except for such failures to be in such full force
and effect or to be valid, binding and enforceable as are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent

 



54  Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, nor, to
the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, is in material breach or
violation of, or default under, any Parent Material Contract, and no event
has occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a

be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and (ii) the Company and Parent
shall prepare, and Parent shall cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form F-4,
which will include the Proxy Statement as a prospectus. Each of the Company

filing and keep the Form F-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete
the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall

 



66  furnish all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of
its capital stock to the other and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form F-4, Proxy Statement and the Circular. The Form F-4,
Proxy Statement and the Circular shall include all information reasonably
requested by such other party to be included therein. Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from

from the SEC or the Canadian Securities Commissions, as applicable, for
amendments or supplements to the Form F-4, the Circular or Proxy Statement,
and shall provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and

materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 under the
Exchange Act or are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as
those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or mailing the Circular or any other materials used in
connection with the Parent Shareholder Meeting that constitute an "information
circular", "proxy-related materials" or are otherwise used for the
"solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are used under applicable Canadian
securities Law or "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials" as those terms
are used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 under the Exchange Act or are otherwise
used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are defined in Rule
14a-1 under the Exchange Act (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC or the Canadian Securities Commissions,
as applicable, with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent (i) shall
provide the other an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response)
and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably
proposed by the other. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form F-4, the
issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Shares issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent will advise the Company promptly
after it receives notice of the issuance by any Canadian Securities
Commission, any other securities regulatory authority, the TSX or by any other
Governmental Authority of any order to cease or suspend trading of any
securities of Parent or the institution or threat of institution of any
proceeding for that purpose. Parent shall also take any other action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now
so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Shares in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of its capital stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

 



67 (b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to,
any of the Form F-4, the Circular or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC and
the Canadian Securities Commissions, as applicable, of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Circular or the Form
F-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in making or otherwise disseminating
the information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of
the Company or Shareholders of Parent, as applicable. Nothing in this
_Section 6.3(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section
6.3(_ _a)_. For purposes of _Section_ _ 4.8_,  _Section_ _ 5.8_ and this
_Section_ _ 6.3_, any information concerning or related to the Company, its
Affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been
provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent
or its Affiliates or the Parent Shareholder Meeting will be deemed to have
been provided by Parent.

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. Without the
prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company and related matters shall be the only proposals to
be submitted to, or voted on by, the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company
and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Form F-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its
stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that
the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by _Section 6.5(_ _d)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), other than (i) to solicit additional
proxies for the purpose of obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) in the
absence of a quorum, and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the
Company Board has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the stockholders of the Company
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent
Articles and Parent Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Circular to be mailed to the
shareholders of Parent and to hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting as soon as

 



68  reasonably practicable after the Form F-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Parent shall, through the Parent Board, recommend to its
shareholders that they give the Parent Shareholder Approval and the Parent
Name Change Approval, include such recommendations in the Circular and solicit
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval
and Parent Name Change Approval, except to the extent that the Parent Board
shall have made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
_Section 6.5(e)_.

Section 6.4  _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
Contracts, and subject to the reasonable restrictions imposed from time to
time upon advice of counsel, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries,
respectively, to, afford to the other party and to the Representatives of
such other party reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices,
books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period,
each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to, furnish reasonably
promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) all
other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business, properties
and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. Without limiting
the foregoing, from the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall maintain,
or cause to be maintained, and provide Parent and its Representatives
continued access to, the Data Site, and shall not remove any documents or
information loaded onto the Data Site prior to, on or after the date hereof.
The Company shall not remove any of the documents or items provided in the
Data Site through and including the Closing Date.

(b) This _Section 6.4_ shall not require either the Company or Parent to
permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable,
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel) of such party (i) would
reasonably be expected to result in any violation of any Contract or Law
to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause any
privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such party or any of its
Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such
information and such undermining of such privilege could in such partys good
faith judgment (after consultation with counsel) adversely affect in any
material respect such partys position in any pending or, what such party
believes in good faith (after consultation with counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) is reasonably pertinent to any litigation, if any, in which
such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other party or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties; _provided_ ,
that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by entering
into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (A) would
not (in the good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the
information (after consultation with counsel)) reasonably be likely to result
in the violation of any such Contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (B) could
reasonably (in the good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose
the information (after consultation with counsel)) be managed through the use
of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to

 



69  which non-employee Representatives of the other party shall be provided
access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the party being
requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify the other party that
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any such Contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other party in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject
matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance
with the first proviso in this  _Section 6.4(b)_) and (z) in the case where
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any Contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable Third Party to any such Contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such Contract).

 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information,
including any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, in
confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will
otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.5_, during the Interim
Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries, and its and their officers and directors, managers or equivalent
not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any other
Representatives of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage
or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition
Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ "), (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Third Party any non-public information in
connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
facilitate in any way any effort by, any Third Party in connection with, any
Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, (iii) approve or recommend a Company
Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar definitive agreement (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 6.5(b)_) providing for or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5_, at any
time prior to obtaining the requisite Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company may, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party made after the date of this Agreement
(that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_) (i) furnish non-
public information to such Third Party (and such Third Partys
Representatives) making a Company Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company receives from the Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, and (B) any non-public information concerning the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries that is provided to such Third Party shall, to the extent
not previously provided to Parent or Merger Sub, be provided to Parent or
Merger Sub prior to or simultaneously with

 



70  providing it to such Third Party), and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives)
with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii): (x) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary by any Third Party, or any Inquiry from any Person seeking to have
discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a possible Company
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Third
Party making the Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and all of the
material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal or
Inquiries. The Company shall also promptly notify Parent if it enters into
discussions or negotiations concerning any Company Acquisition Proposal or
provides nonpublic information or data to any person in accordance with this 
_Section 6.5(c)_ and keep the other party informed of the status and terms of
any such proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis,
including by providing a copy of all material documentation or
correspondence relating thereto.

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve,
adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend) any
Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement or any Schedule 14D-9, as applicable, (iv) fail to
publicly recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal within five (5)
business days of the request of Parent and reaffirm the Company Recommendation
within five (5) business days (any of the actions described in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this  _Section 6.5(d)_, a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve, adopt, declare advisable or
recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare
advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company to enter into, any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.5_).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
shall be permitted to (x) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement, including an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, with respect to a
Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with _Section 6.5(f)_ and _Section
8.3_, if the Company Board (A) has received a Company Acquisition Proposal
that, in the good faith determination of the Company Board,
after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, after having
complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be
offered by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to, _Section 6.5(f)_, and (B)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (y) effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event if
the Company

 



71  Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(e)_, neither the Parent Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner
adverse to the Company or the Parent Recommendation, or (ii) fail to include
the Parent Recommendation in the Circular or any Schedule 14D-9, as
applicable (any of the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii), a " _Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Shareholder Approval, and subject to compliance with _Section 6.5(g)_ and
_Section 8.3_, the Parent Board shall be permitted to effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change if, after the date of this Agreement a Parent
Intervening Event has occurred or arisen and the Parent Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) The Company Board shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement or
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted under _Section
6.5(d)_ in circumstances involving or relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and Merger Sub that the Company intends to
take such action and describing the material terms and conditions of, and
attaching a complete copy of, the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such
action (it being understood that such material terms need not include the
identity of the Third Party), (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period
following Parents and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and
Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii) following the end of the five (5)
Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, taking into account
any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in
response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the financial terms
or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal, and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that references to the five (5) Business Day period above shall then be deemed
to be references to a three (3) Business Day period.

 

(g) Other than in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal (which shall
be subject to _Section 6.5(f)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
6.5(g)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
Board from making a Company Adverse Recommendation in response to a Company
Intervening Event to the extent that (i) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(ii) (A) the Company provides Parent five (5) Business Days written notice of
its intention to take such action, which notice

 



72  shall specify the reasons therefor, (B) after providing such notice and
prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent during such five (5) Business Day period
(to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the
terms of this Agreement as would not permit the Company Board to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 6.5(g)_, and
(C) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement offered in writing by Parent, and following such five (5) Business
Day period, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law would continue to require a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Company Intervening Event.

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any disclosure other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any
applicable Company Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Company Recommendation to the Companys stockholders in favor of the Merger
shall be deemed to be an Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(i) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and
its and their officers and directors, managers or equivalent, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause any other Representatives of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries to immediately cease any existing discussions,
negotiations or communications (including discontinuing access to the Data
Site) with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, within ten (10) Business Days of the
date hereof, request that, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
cause, all Third Parties who have been furnished confidential information
regarding the Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions
regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal within the twelve (12) months prior
to the date of this Agreement to promptly return or destroy such information
(to the extent that the Company is entitled to have such information returned
or destroyed).

(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any unsolicited _bona fide_
indication of interest, inquiry, proposal or offer from any Third Party for
(or expression by a Third Party that it is considering or may engage in),
whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) any sale,
lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of equity interests,
share exchange, joint venture, business combination or otherwise, of any
assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary representing twenty percent
(20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-value basis, or to
which twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings
are attributable, (ii) any issue, sale or other disposition of (including by
way of merger, consolidation, joint venture,

 



73  business combination, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into,
such securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting
power of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenue, net income or assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) any tender
offer or exchange offer in which any Person or " _group_ " (as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall seek to
acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any
class of voting securities of the Company, (iv) any
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
type of transaction with respect to the Company in which a Third Party shall
acquire beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net
revenue, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (v) any transaction which is similar in form, substance
or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the term " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall not include the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a _bona fide_ written Company
Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the
references in the definition of " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " to "twenty
percent (20%)" shall be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") on its most
recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified, made by a Third
Party on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial and legal advisors, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the
transaction described in such proposal (including the identity of the Person
making such proposal, any termination or break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions, and conditions to, and timing and likelihood of consummation as
well as post-closing synergies and _pro forma_ economics, to the extent
applicable), as well as any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in response to such proposal or otherwise,
to be more favorable to the Company and the Companys stockholders (solely in
their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Reference to "this Agreement" in this
paragraph shall be deemed to include any proposed alteration of the terms of
this Agreement by Parent.

(k) Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) after receipt of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
by any Third Party, or any Inquiry from any Person seeking to have
discussions or negotiations with Parent relating to a possible Parent
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Third
Party making the Parent Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and the material
terms and conditions of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or Inquiries. Parent
shall also promptly notify the Company if it

 



74  enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Parent Acquisition
Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person in accordance
with this _Section 6.5(k)_ and keep the other party informed of the status
and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a
current basis, including by providing a copy of all material documentation or
correspondence relating thereto.

 

Section 6.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree to make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and to make all other filings
required to be made prior to the Effective Time by applicable foreign
Antitrust Laws (collectively, " _Foreign Antitrust Approvals_ ") with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in
any event prior to the expiration of any applicable legal deadline (
_provided_ , that the submission or filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act will be made within ten (10) Business Days of the date
of this Agreement) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and any other filings required in connection with the Foreign Antitrust

(and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries,
respectively, to) take any and all actions necessary to obtain any consents,
clearances or approvals required under or in connection with any Antitrust
Laws, and to enable all waiting periods under applicable Antitrust Laws to
expire, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under applicable
Antitrust Laws asserted by an Governmental Authority, in each case, to cause

prior to the Outside Date, including but not limited to (x) promptly complying
with or modifying any request for additional information (including any second
request) by any Governmental Authority, (y) if necessary to obtain clearance

businesses of the Company and Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, and
(z) contesting, defending and appealing any lawsuit or other legal proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, threatened or pending preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of any
party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to
commit to any actions that would, individually or in combination, materially
reduce the reasonably anticipated benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section 6.5_ ), and except with regard to the Antitrust Laws
which shall be governed by _Section 6.6(a)_, each of the Company and Parent
shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries,
respectively, to) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be

cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any

(i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause the conditions to Closing
set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from

additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

(c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries or the Company
Subsidiaries, respectively, to give) any notices to Third Parties, and Parent
shall use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best
efforts, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with Parent in its efforts, to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by
_Sections 6.6(a)_ and _6.6(b)_ that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any approval
or consent from any third party pursuant to this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall not be
considered a condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger.

(d) Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with the preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and
will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) informing

Governmental Authority.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger, without the prior written
consent of Parent, none of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any of the Companys or Company Subsidiarys Representatives, shall pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur
any liability or other obligation to such Person. The Company shall cooperate
with Parent and the Merger Sub with respect to accommodations that may be
requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.

 



76 Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, to the extent in each case it obtains Knowledge
thereof, of (i) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, contained herein at any time during the
term hereof, (ii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in _Article VII_ and (iii) any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VII_ ; _provided_ that, in
the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the failure to comply with this
_Section 6.7(b)_ shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of
the conditions to the Closing in _Article VII_ , or give rise to any right to
terminate this Agreement under _Article VIII_ , if the underlying fact,
circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself give rise to such
failure or right. 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving such party or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which relate to this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Parent shall give the Company the opportunity to reasonably
participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation
against Parent and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed
to without the Companys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such settlement
involves only the payment of money and the amount of such settlement shall be
fully covered by insurance proceeds.

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise required by this
Agreement, neither the Company, Parent nor Merger Sub shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement or
disclosure to any third party of the existence or any subject matter relating
to, or terms or conditions of, this Agreement unless mutually approved by

 



77  Parent and the Company, prior to release, announcement or disclosure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party or its Representatives may issue a
public announcement or other public disclosures required by Law or the rules
of any stock exchange upon which such partys equity securities are traded,
_provided_ that such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the other
party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure
and provide reasonable comment regarding same. The Merger and this Agreement
will be publicly announced in a mutually agreed form and at a mutually agreed
time by Parent and Company.

 

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as
provided in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or each of the Company
Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational or governing documents) shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
The Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to)
(i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees
with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at
any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent required by the
Company Charter or Company Bylaws, or the articles or certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents)
of any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, or applicable Law, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to (x) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee
or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (y) this
Agreement and any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys
fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this _Section 6.9(b)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity not to) settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be
sought under this  _Section 6.9(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all

 



78  Indemnitees from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, and does not include an admission of fault or
wrongdoing by any Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent and
(ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent
that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-
appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in
which case the Indemnitee shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving
Entity the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies and with policy
limits no less than the limits on the Companys existing policies as long as
the annual premium does not exceed 300% of the annual premium under the
Companys existing policies. If the Company or the Surviving Entity for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in effect, for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Entity to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO
Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier,
that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company (which may
be provided under Parents DandO Insurance policy) or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated
to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.9_.

 



79 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_
to the contrary, this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger in accordance with its terms and shall be binding, jointly and
severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and
its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their
successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys
all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, commercially reasonable efforts shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 

Section 6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, provide to each employee of
the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries who is employed by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and
continues to be employed by the Surviving Entity or any of the
Company Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (each a "
_Company Employee_ ") (i) a base salary (or wage rate) and target cash
incentive compensation opportunity at least equal to such Company Employees
base salary (or wage rate) and target cash incentive compensation opportunity
in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits (excluding equity arrangements, deferred compensation arrangements,
retiree health and welfare benefits and defined benefit pension plans) that
are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the employee benefits provided
to the Company Employees by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, to
each Company Employee whose employment with the Surviving Entity, Company
Subsidiaries and its Affiliates is involuntarily terminated in a severance-
qualifying manner during the one (1)-year period following the Effective Time,
severance benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the severance benefits, if any, that would have been provided to such Company
Employee pursuant to the terms of the severance pay arrangements maintained by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries upon such an involuntary severance-
qualifying termination of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) For purposes of eligibility and vesting, benefit accrual
and determination of level of benefits under the compensation and benefit
plans, programs agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Parent
Subsidiaries, the Company Subsidiaries, the Surviving Entity and any of its
subsidiaries or any respective Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), including for
purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits
under New Plans, but excluding for purposes of benefit accruals under any
defined benefit plan or for purposes of vesting in any new equity-based
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, each

 



80  Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any
additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan,
except (i) for New Plans as to which employees who are similarly situated to
the Company Employees are not provided such service credit or (ii) where such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any plan that is an
"employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause: (i) each Company Employee
to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage
under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before such replacement; and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents (except to the extent such
restrictions were applicable and not satisfied by the Company Employee as of
the Effective Time under the comparable Company Benefit Plan), and any
eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year
prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(d) Prior to making any material broad-based written or oral communications to
the directors, officers or employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected
by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication.

 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.10_ with respect to employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are included for the sole and exclusive benefit of the respective
parties hereto and shall not create any right, express or implied (i) in any
other person, including employees, former employees, any participant or any
beneficiary thereof in any Company Benefit Plan or (ii) to continued
employment with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 6.10_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit
plans of the Company or Parent.

 

Section 6.11 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each use its reasonable best efforts
(i) to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) to provide such information as
reasonably requested by the Company in

 



81  connection with the Companys request for an IRS private letter ruling
and/or for an opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (" _Skadden_
"), counsel to the Company, as applicable, regarding the application of
Sections 368 and/or 367(a) of the Code to the Merger, including executing and
delivering officers certificates containing representations from the officers
of the Company and Parent in connection with such IRS private letter ruling
and/or opinions, as applicable.

(b) Neither Parent nor the Company shall take or fail to take (and, following
the Merger, Parent will cause the Company not to take or fail to take) any
action which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to (i)
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. With respect to the Merger, if applicable,
Parent will (and following the Merger, Parent will cause the Company to) file
all required information with its Tax Returns and maintain all
records required for Tax purposes, including, if applicable, the reporting
requirements contained in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

 

(c) If the Company obtains a favorable IRS private letter ruling or believes
based on advice from counsel that it is more likely than not that the Merger
is not subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, Parent will make commercially
reasonable arrangements with each five-percent transferee shareholder (as
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) and
each "5-percent shareholder" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.367(a)-3(b)(1)(ii)), if any, to ensure that such shareholder will be
informed of any "triggering event" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8(j)(1) or (2).

(d) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective
Times. Parent shall pay, without deduction from any amount payable to holders
of Company Common Stock and without reimbursement from the other party, any
such Taxes or fees imposed on it by any Governmental Authority (or for which
its shareholders are primarily liable), which becomes payable in connection
with the Merger.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a duly
executed certificate, dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing Date, certifying that (A) the Company is not and in the preceding
five-year period has never been a "United States real property holding
corporation" as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and (B) none of the Company Common Stock
constitutes a "United States real property interest" as defined in Section
897(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, which
certificate shall be in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections
1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) and in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

 

Section 6.12 _Dividends_. In the event that a distribution with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement
(including pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ above) has (i) a record date prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been

 



82  paid as of the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive such distribution from the Company at the time
such shares are exchanged pursuant to  _ARTICLE III_ of this Agreement.

Section 6.13 _Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct
any business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated
by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness.

Section 6.14  _Section 16 Matters_. Assuming that the Company delivers to
Parent, in a timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, all requisite
information necessary for Parent and Merger Sub to take the actions
contemplated by this  _Section 6.14_, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
each shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure
that (a) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities related to such stock) resulting from the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time are exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (b) any acquisitions
of Parent Common Shares (including derivative securities related to such
stock) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who may become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent are
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.15 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent
Common Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on NASDAQ
and the TSX, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective

this Agreement and approval of the Merger. The Company shall vote all shares
of Parent Common Shares beneficially owned by it or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as of the record date for the Parent Shareholder Meeting in favor
of adoption of this Agreement, approval of the Merger, and issuance of shares
of Parent Common Shares in connection therewith.

appointment of the three directors set forth on  _Exhibit C_ attached hereto
or such other individuals as may be mutually agreed between Parent and the
Company (the " _Continuing Company Directors_ ") to fill the vacancies on the
Parent Board resulting from such resignations, and (iv) each committee of the
Parent Board to include such number of Continuing Company Directors as
determined by Parent after taking into account each such Continuing Company
Directors relevant experience and expertise.

 



83 (b) From and after the Closing, the Parent Board shall take all necessary
actions to nominate, and to cause the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee of Parent to recommend that the Parent Board nominate, the
Continuing Company Directors for election to the Parent Board at the 2016
annual meeting of shareholders of Parent, the 2017 annual meeting of
shareholders of Parent and the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders of Parent;
_provided_ , that no Continuing Company Director shall be subject to re-
nomination in accordance with this _Section 6.17(b)_ in the event such
Continuing Company Director fails (i) to comply in all material respects with
the governance guidelines and policies of Parent applicable to Parent
directors during the fiscal year immediately preceding such Continuing
Company Directors re-nomination or (ii) to attend in-person at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the duly called meetings of the Parent Board for

replacement Continuing Company Director to fill the vacancy created by such
death, resignation or removal. The Continuing Company Directors shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.17_. Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Continuing
Company Director in seeking the enforcement of the rights and obligations
provided for in this _Section 6.17_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of Company
Subsidiary shall directly, or indirectly, either on its own account or for
any person, firm or company (except by means of a generally public
solicitation or by retaining an executive recruiting firm that has not been
directed to approach and does not approach employees of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary), solicit, or endeavor to cause, any employee of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to alter in any way, terminate or breach his, her or its
relationship or agreement with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall

to alter in any way, terminate or breach his, her or its relationship or

Section 6.19 _Amendment to Rights Agreement_. The Company Board shall take all
necessary action so that none of the performance by the respective parties
hereto of their obligations hereunder, nor any of the transactions
contemplated hereunder will cause (i) the Rights to become exercisable under

be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Rights Agreement); or (iii)
the "Stock Acquisition Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to occur

available to any party if the failure of such party (and in the case of

obligations under this Agreement has been a principal cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before

 



88  such date; _provided further_ that if the waiting period applicable to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement under the HSR Act shall not have
expired or been terminated or any other mandatory waiting period or required

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance

held Company Stockholder Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement

material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x)

before the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company within
twenty (20) days of receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or

and void and of no further 

 



90  force or effect whatsoever without liability on the part of any party hereto
(or any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent Subsidiaries or any of the
Companys or Parents respective Representatives), and all rights and
obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary (a) no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from or arising out of any willful or intentional breach of this
Agreement; and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 8.2_,
_Section 8.3_, _Section 8.6_, _Article IX_  and the definitions of all

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, then
the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, within two
(2) Business Days of such termination.

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_, then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Company the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by the Company within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

 

(c) In the event that, prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, a Company
Acquisition Proposal is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed and this
Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ as a result of a
willful breach by the Company or _Section 8.1(d)(ii)(A)_, then the Company
shall pay to Parent the Expenses of Parent within two (2) Business Days after
receipt following such termination of documentation supporting such Expenses
of Parent. If, concurrently, or within twelve (12) months after any
such termination described in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or otherwise consummates,
any Company Acquisition Proposal (substituting fifty percent (50%) for the
twenty percent (20%) threshold set forth in the definition of " _Company
Acquisition Proposal_ ") for all purposes under this _Section 8.3(c)_, then
the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee as promptly as possible
(but in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the consummation of
such Company Acquisition Proposal, unless the Termination Fee has already been
paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_. Parents right to receive the
one-time payment of the Termination Fee (if and when due) and the Expenses of
Parent from the Company as provided in this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent against the Company with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event that
this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ as a result of a
willful breach by the Company or _Section 8.1(d)(ii)(A)_.

(d) In the event that, prior to Parent Shareholder Meeting, (i) a
Parent Acquisition Proposal is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed, (ii)
the Third Party making such

 



91  Parent Acquisition Proposal has publicly indicated to the Parent
shareholders to the effect that they should not vote in favor of any of the
matters required by the Parent Shareholder Approval, and (iii) this Agreement
is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ or by
the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ as a result of a willful breach
by Parent, then Parent shall pay to the Company the Expenses of the Company
within two (2) Business Days after receipt following such termination of
documentation supporting such Expenses of the Company. If, concurrently, or
within twelve (12) months after any such termination described in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Parent enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or otherwise consummates, any Parent Acquisition Proposal for
all purposes under this _Section 8.3(d)_, then Parent shall pay to the
Company the Termination Fee as promptly as possible (but in any event within
two (2) Business Days) following the consummation of such Parent Acquisition
Proposal. The Companys right to receive the one-time payment of
the Termination Fee (if and when due) and the Expenses of the Company from
Parent as provided in this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available to the Company against Parent with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event that this Agreement is
terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ or by
the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ as a result of a willful breach
by Parent.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

 

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee earlier than one (1) full Business Day after receipt of
appropriate wire transfer instructions from Parent; and

(ii) under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and
(iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, either the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the
payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, such paying party
shall pay the other party its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of ten percent (10%)
for the period from the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their

 



92  respective boards of directors (or similar governing body or entity) at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (a) any amendment
of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock, or
which by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange
requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company or Parent
without such further approval of such stockholders, or (b) any amendment or
change not permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.

Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and
Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and filing of
the Form F-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement
and the Circular, other than attorneys and accountants fees.

"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other instrument made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a person are also to
its successors and permitted assigns. All references to " _dollars_ " or "
_$_ " refer to currency of the United States of America.

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid
or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole
or in part, by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto
(except to the Surviving Entity).

 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the
parties hereto and their

 



95  respective successors and permitted assigns, except for the provisions of
_Section 6.9_ and _6.17_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in _Section
6.23_ are included for the sole and exclusive benefit of the respective
parties hereto and shall not create any right, express or implied in any other
Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_
without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, persons other than the
parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of

party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (ii)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any United States
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in

any such court and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to

Delaware or any Delaware state court. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the

or in any other manner provided by Law.
