the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten days after

assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person will be entitled to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim.

rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the other party, except that Purchaser may assign any of its rights and delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement to any (i)&nbsp;to any Affiliate of Purchaser, and (ii)&nbsp;in connection
with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Purchaser, provided that no such

the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to
the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing in this Agreement will
be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable
right under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except such

arising between the parties relating to this Agreement shall be determined by arbitration in
Chicago, Illinois by one arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association (the &#147;<U>AAA</U>&#148;) and its Supplementary Procedures for Large,
Complex Disputes, except that (a)&nbsp;every person named on all lists of potential arbitrators shall be
a neutral and impartial lawyer with excellent professional credentials (i)&nbsp;who has practiced law
for at least 15&nbsp;years, specializing in general corporate and commercial matters and (ii)&nbsp;who has
had experience, and is generally available to serve, as an arbitrator, and (b)&nbsp;each party shall be
entitled to strike on a peremptory basis, for any reason or no reason, one of the names of
potential arbitrators on any list submitted to the parties by the AAA as well as any person
selected by the AAA to serve as an arbitrator by administrative appointment. In the event the
parties cannot agree on the selection of the arbitrator from the list submitted by the AAA within
20&nbsp;days after the AAA transmits to the parties its list of potential arbitrators, the selection of
the arbitrator shall be made by the AAA from the remaining nominees. The selection of the
arbitrator shall be made by the AAA from the remaining nominees in accordance with the parties&#146;
mutual order of preference. The arbitrator shall endeavor to base his award on applicable law and
judicial precedent and shall include in such award the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon
which the award is based, and the arbitrator shall not grant any remedy or relief that a court
could not grant under applicable law. The award shall be final and binding on all parties and
shall not be vacated or modified (for errors of law or otherwise) except upon the grounds expressly
provided in the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Each party will
bear its own expenses with respect to arbitration and the parties will share equally the fees and
expenses of the AAA and the arbitrator.
