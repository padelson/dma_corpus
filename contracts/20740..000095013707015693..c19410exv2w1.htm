AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of October 17, 2007, by and among CLARCOR Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), PECO Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser (" _Merger Sub_ "), Perry Equipment Corporation, a Texas corporation (the " _Company_ "), and PECO Management, LLC, as the Shareholder Representative. Capitalized terms used herein are defined in the Sections of this Agreement referenced in _Appendix A_ attached hereto. 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company have each determined that the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders and have approved the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain Shareholders of the Company are entering into a Shareholders Agreement, pursuant to which each such Shareholder has agreed, among other things, to vote (including by execution a written consent) the shares of the Company Common Stock held by such Shareholder in favor of approval of this Agreement, including the Merger; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1. 
 MERGER 

   

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Texas Business Corporation Act (the " _TBCA_ "), and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the Company will cease and Merger Sub will continue as the surviving entity of the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ "). 

  

 Section 1.2 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger will be as provided in the TBCA and DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to Article 5.06 of the TBCA and all applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Surviving Entity. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Entity, until duly amended in accordance with applicable law; 

   ##### 

  

    

provided, however, that Article First of the certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub shall be amended effective as of the Effective Time to read as
follows: "The name of the corporation is Perry Equipment Corporation." The
bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be the bylaws of the Surviving Entity, until duly amended in accordance with
applicable law; provided, however, that such bylaws will be amended to refer
to the name of the Surviving Entity as "Perry Equipment Corporation." 

  

 Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of the Surviving Entity immediately after the Effective Time shall be as set forth on _Appendix B_ hereto, to serve, in both cases, until their successors shall have been elected and qualified or until otherwise provided by law and the certificate of incorporation and/or bylaws of the Surviving Entity. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Closing and Effective Time of Merger_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") will take places at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 5200, Dallas, Texas 75201 at 10:00 a.m., central time, on the later of (a) December 3, 2007 or (b) the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in  _Article 6_ (or on such other date or at such other location as mutually agreed to by Purchaser and the Company) (the " _Closing Date_ "). In addition to the other actions contemplated hereunder, Merger Sub and the Company will cause Articles of Merger satisfying the requirements of the TBCA, in form mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Company (the " _Texas Articles of Merger_ "), and a Certificate of Merger satisfying the requirements of the DGCL, in form mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Company (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ "), to be properly executed, verified and delivered for filing in accordance with the TBCA and DGCL, as applicable, on the Closing Date. The Merger will become effective upon the filing of both the Texas Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas in accordance with the TBCA and the filing of the Delaware Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later time which Purchaser and the Company will have agreed upon and designated in such filing in accordance with applicable law (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.6 _Agreements to be Entered Into Concurrently with Merger Agreement_. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the persons below will execute and deliver the following agreements: (i) Restrictive Covenant Agreements, between CLARCOR and each of PECO Partners I, Ltd., PECO Partners II, Ltd., PECO Partners III, Ltd., Laine Perry, Leigh Perry Payne, Doris Perry McConnell and Mike McConnell, (ii) Consulting Agreements, between Merger Sub and each of Marney Dunman Perry, Jr. and Laine Perry, (iii) a release, between CLARCOR and each of PECO Partners I, Ltd., PECO Partners II, Ltd., PECO Partners III, Ltd., Laine Perry, Leigh Perry Payne, Doris Perry McConnell and Mike McConnell, (iv) a Shareholders Agreement, between CLARCOR and each of PECO Partners I, Ltd., PECO Partners II, Ltd., PECO Partners III, Ltd., Laine Perry and Doris Perry McConnell (the " _Shareholders Agreement_ "), and (v) an acknowledgement letter, between CLARCOR and Merger Sub and Laine Perry. Pursuant to the terms of each of these agreements (other than the Shareholders Agreement), the parties thereto shall not have any rights or obligations pursuant to such agreements prior to Closing, and in the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever and the Closing does not occur, then such agreements shall automatically be terminated for all purposes without any action by the parties thereto and shall be void __ab initio__. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE 2. 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

   

 Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the respective shareholders thereof, each share of the capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Entity. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Conversion of Capital Stock of the Company_. 

  

 (a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the respective shareholders thereof, all shares of the Companys common stock, no par value (" _Company Common Stock_ "), that are owned by the Company as treasury stock shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) _Aggregate Merger Consideration_. Subject to _Section 2.6_, and prior to adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.4_, the aggregate merger consideration payable for the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") shall be $161,050,000 consisting of (i) 2,343,750 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Purchaser (" _Purchaser Common Stock_ "), (the " _Share Consideration_ "), plus (ii) cash in an amount equal to $86,050,000 (the " _Base Cash Consideration_ "), subject to adjustment as provided below, including, without limitation, the withholding of the Escrowed Shares and Escrowed Cash at Closing as contemplated by _Section 2.2(g)_, the adjustments to the Share Consideration at Closing contemplated by _Section 2.3_ based on changes to the Average Closing Price and adjustments to the Base Cash Consideration following the Closing as contemplated by _Section 2.4_ based on changes to the Adjusted Consolidated Net Working Capital. The issuance of the Purchaser Common Stock will not be registered, and the holders of Converted Company Shares receiving shares of Purchaser Common Stock will have registration rights pursuant to, and such holders will not be permitted to transfer such shares except in accordance with, the Registration Rights Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Per Share Merger Consideration_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the respective shareholders thereof, each of the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) (all such shares, excluding the Dissenting Shares, the " _Converted Company Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the following consideration: 

    

 (i) for each Converted Company Share beneficially owned by the PECO Employees Stock Ownership Trust (the " _ESOP_ ") and the estate of E. B. Cooper (the " _Cooper Estate_ "), an amount in cash equal to the quotient of (A) the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration Amount (as defined below), divided by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _ESOP/Cooper Estate Per Share Cash Consideration_ "), or 

   

 (ii) for each Converted Company Share beneficially owned by all Shareholders (other than the ESOP and Cooper Estate) an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the Base Cash Consideration (less the aggregate amount of all cash paid to the ESOP and the 

   ##### 

  

   

Cooper Estate pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(i)_ above) divided by (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, less the number of Converted Company Shares owned by the ESOP
and the Cooper Estate (the " _General Per Share Cash Consideration_ "); plus
an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the Share Consideration (as adjusted
at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof) divided by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, less the number of Converted Company Shares owned by the ESOP
and the Cooper Estate (the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ ") (the General
Per Share Cash Consideration and Per Share Stock Consideration, collectively,
the " _General Per Share Merger Consideration_ "; the General Per Share
Merger Consideration and ESOP/Cooper Estate Per Share Cash Consideration are
collectively referred to herein as the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_
"). 

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration
Amount_ " means (i) the total amount of the Base Cash Consideration, prior to
adjustment following the Closing contemplated by _Section 2.4_ based on
changes to the Adjusted Consolidated Net Working Capital, plus (ii) the
product of (a) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued
at Closing as part of the Merger Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 2.3_, multiplied by (b) the Average Closing Price. 

   

 (d) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the respective shareholders thereof, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to exist, all certificates for such stock shall be canceled and no shares of the Surviving Entity shall be exchanged therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that each holder of Company Common Stock (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares) as of the Effective Time shall be entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ above, upon delivery of a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ and, other than the ESOP and Cooper Estate, a subscription agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ and a registration rights agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ "), to the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder (and it is acknowledged and agreed that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Purchaser will withhold the Per Share Merger Consideration payable to any such holder of Company Common Stock until such holder makes the deliveries set forth above). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall receive an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fraction, and (ii) the Average Closing Price. 

   

 (e) _Intentionally Omitted_. 

   

 (f) _Payment of Merger Consideration_. At the Closing, Purchaser will 

    

 (i) pay the Base Cash Consideration, less the Escrowed Cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Shareholder Representative, for the benefit of the holders of all Converted Company Shares; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) deliver stock certificates evidencing the Share Consideration, less the Escrowed Shares, to the Shareholder Representative, for the benefit of the holders of all Converted Company Shares, other than the ESOP and Cooper Estate. 

  

 (g) _Escrowed Shares and Escrowed Cash_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement, for deposit into an escrow fund on behalf of all the holders of Converted Company Shares (other than the ESOP and Cooper Estate), $6,000,000 of the Base Cash Consideration (the " _Escrowed Cash_ "), plus a portion of the Share Consideration (the " _Escrowed Shares_ ") that has an aggregate value, based on the Average Closing Price, equal to $10,000,000 (rounded to the nearest whole share) of the Merger Consideration (collectively, the " _Escrow Fund_ "). The Escrowed Shares shall be held by the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement as nominee for the holders of Converted Company Shares (other than the ESOP and Cooper Estate). The Escrow Fund will be distributed by such escrow agent to the Shareholder Representative, for the benefit of the holders of Converted Company Shares (other than the ESOP and Cooper Estate), and/or the Purchaser, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Adjustments to Share Consideration_. The Share Consideration payable at Closing shall, if applicable, be adjusted as follows: 

   

 (a) In the event the Average Closing Price is less than $31.25, the number of shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Purchaser Common Stock to be included in the Share Consideration shall be increased by (a) 2,343,750, multiplied by (b) the amount by which $31.25 exceeds the Average Closing Price and then divided by (c) the Average Closing Price. 

   

 (b) In the event the Average Closing Price is greater than $32.75, the number of shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Purchaser Common Stock to be included in the Share Consideration shall be decreased by (a) 2,343,750, multiplied by (b) the amount by which the Average Closing Price exceeds $32.75 and then divided by (c) the Average Closing Price. 

   

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Average Closing Price_ " shall mean the average closing price of the Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten consecutive trading days ending with the fifth complete trading day ending immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 2.4 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) _Closing Date Balance Sheet and Closing Date Net Working Capital Calculation_. Within 60 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholder Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and a calculation of the Adjusted Consolidated Net Working Capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Net Working Capital Calculation_ "). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "), applied on a basis consistent with the Reference Balance Sheet. Immediately following the Closing, Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative will conduct an inventory of the Companys inventory for purposes of identifying the inventory of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and the value of such inventory for purposes of preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net Working Capital Calculation. Purchaser and the Shareholder Representative will each designate one or more representative(s) to conduct such inventory. The Shareholder Representative and its accountants shall be entitled to review the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net

Shareholders and Purchaser will each bear half of the fees and costs of the
Independent Accountants for such determination. 

   

 (e) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Within three Business Days after the Closing Date Net Working Capital Calculation becomes binding and conclusive pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the following payments shall be made:

 (ii) If the amount of the Closing Date Net Working Capital Calculation is more than $16,850,000, then Purchaser shall pay to the Shareholder Representative, for the benefit of the holders of all Converted Company Shares, an amount equal to the difference pursuant to wire transfer instructions provided in writing by the Shareholder Representative.

 (i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Shareholder Representative shall withhold from the Base Cash Consideration otherwise payable by the Shareholder Representative to the Shareholders pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)(i)_ above, an amount at least equal to an amount, if any, estimated in good faith, after consultation with Purchaser, by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company that may be payable by the Shareholders to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)(i)_ until the Closing Date Net Working Capital Calculation has become binding and conclusive pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and, if a payment is actually owed to Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 2.4(e)(i)_, such payment has been made in full to Purchaser. The Shareholder Representative shall promptly provide written notice to Purchaser of the amount, if any, that the Shareholder Representative withheld from the Base Cash Consideration otherwise payable to the Shareholders in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

 (ii) After making any payment that is owed by the Shareholders to Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 2.4(e)(i)_ or after receiving any payment that is owed by Purchaser to the Shareholders pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)(ii)_, the Shareholder Representative, shall distribute to the Shareholders on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of Converted Company Shares held by such Shareholders all amounts then held by the Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders. 

  

 (g) _Treatment for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made under this _Section 2.4_ shall be treated by the Purchaser, the Company and holders of Converted Company Shares as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall 

   ##### 

  

   

include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to such
payment causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration for tax purposes. 

   

 Section 2.5 _Required Withholding_. Purchaser and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax laws or under any other applicable Legal Requirements.

 (b) _Loss of Status as Dissenting Shares_. If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Sections 2.3_ and _2.4_ , without interest thereon, upon surrender of the stock certificate formerly representing such shares. 

   

 (c) _Cooperation_. If Purchaser has waived the condition precedent set forth in  _Section 6.2(o)_ with respect to any Shareholder who has made a demand for appraisal of such Shareholders shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the TBCA, the Company shall give Purchaser: (i) prompt notice of any such written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the TBCA, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the TBCA that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument.

However, (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic taxes such as real and personal property taxes shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a daily basis.

two Business Days prior to the filing of any such Tax Returns, the

The Shareholder Representative and Purchaser shall consult with each other and attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of any Tax Returns described in this _Section 7.2(b)_. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be timely filed on that basis.

 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 (c) With respect to any Damages arising from third party claims or any claims made by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons in connection with any environmental matters, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons will seek indemnification and reimbursement for all Damages solely and exclusively pursuant to the terms of the Environmental Policy, except to the extent that coverage under the Environmental Policy is excluded or the Environmental Policy is terminated as a result of a breach of the representation set forth in _Section 3.17(b)_ and except that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to obtain reimbursement for the entire amount of the self-insured retention (in the retention amounts provided for in the Environmental Policy as in effect immediately prior to the Closing) for any claims made pursuant to the Environmental Policy prior to the third anniversary of the Closing and one-half of the self-insured retention (in the retention amounts provided for in the Environmental Policy as in effect immediately prior to the Closing) for any claims made pursuant to the Environmental Policy during the period from the third anniversary of the Closing to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) The Purchaser Indemnified Persons will not be indemnified for matters arising under  _Section 9.2_ pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement until the total amount of Damages incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed the Deductible; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation will not apply to (i) any breaches arising out of or in connection with  _Section 3.4(a)_ and _(c)_ (Capitalization), _Section 3.10_ (Tax Matters) and  _Section 3.15(c)_ (Compliance with 

   ##### 

  

 

Legal Requirements; Government Authorizations), (ii) any claims arising under
clauses (c), (d) or (f) of _Section 9.2_ and (iii) any failure of the
Shareholders to pay any post-closing purchase price adjustment required to be
made by the Shareholders pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)(i)_. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit or restrict any Person who is a party to any agreement entered at Closing to obtain Damages or any other legal or equitable relief from any other Person who is a party to any such agreement in connection with the breach of such agreement by such other Person. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Procedure for Indemnification  Third Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under _Section 9.2_ or  _9.3_ (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of notice of the assertion of any claim against any Indemnified Person by a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an " _Indemnifying Person_ ") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified Persons failure to give such notice. 

  

 (b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_ of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this _Article 9_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) it shall be conclusively established for all purposes that the Third-Party Claim is properly the subject of indemnification hereunder and the Indemnifying Person shall thereafter be estopped from claiming otherwise in any subsequent Proceeding between the parties; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Persons consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any Legal Requirement or any violation of the rights of any Person; and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person; and (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim effected without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten days after the Indemnified Persons notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person will be entitled to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may materially adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 Section 9.6 _Procedure For Indemnification  Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to the Escrow Agreement will be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provided for in this _Article 9_ shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to an Indemnified Party in connection with any Damages arising out of the matters set forth in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, provided that nothing herein will limit (i) any Indemnified Persons rights hereunder or otherwise to injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce its rights under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any claim related to any breach described in _Section 9.4(e)_, (iii) any claim brought by any Company Indemnified Persons under federal or state securities laws relating to the purchase or ownership of the Purchaser Common Stock by the Shareholders or (iv) any claim related to the failure of the Shareholders to pay any post-closing purchase price adjustment required to be made by the Shareholders pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)(i)_.

 Section 10.2 _Headings; Construction_. The headings of Articles and Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are incorporated into and constitute an integral part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as the context requires. All references to documents, instruments or agreements will be deemed to refer as well to all addenda, exhibits, schedules or amendments thereto. The word "including" shall be read as "including but not limited to" and otherwise shall be considered illustrative and non-limiting. The statements in the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, and those in any supplement thereto, relate only to the representations and warranties in the Section of the Agreement to which they expressly relate and not to any other representation or warranty in this Agreement. All references to dollars or "$" in this Agreement will be to U.S. dollars. The language used in the Agreement will be construed, in all cases, according to its fair meaning, and not for or against any party hereto. The parties acknowledge that each party has reviewed this Agreement and that rules of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party will not be available in the interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 10.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provisions of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon a determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the maximum extent possible. 

  

 Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; No Modification_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes, Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement and the other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties and supersede all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement signed by the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and the Shareholder Representative. 

  

 Section 10.5 _Waiver_. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, and no single or partial exercise of any such right will preclude any other or further exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other parties; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or 

   ##### 

  

 

demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement. The rights and remedies of the
parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. 

   

 Section 10.6 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Purchaser may assign any of its rights and delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement to any (i) to any Affiliate of Purchaser, and (ii) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Purchaser, provided that no such assignment or delegation will relieve Purchaser from any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except such rights as will inure to a successor or permitted assignee pursuant to this _Section 10.6_. 

  

 Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. 

  

 Section 10.8 _Arbitration_. Any controversy, claim or dispute of whatever nature arising between the parties relating to this Agreement shall be determined by arbitration in Chicago, Illinois by one arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ") and its Supplementary Procedures for Large, Complex Disputes, except that (a) every person named on all lists of potential arbitrators shall be a neutral and impartial lawyer with excellent professional credentials (i) who has practiced law for at least 15 years, specializing in general corporate and commercial matters and (ii) who has had experience, and is generally available to serve, as an arbitrator, and (b) each party shall be entitled to strike on a peremptory basis, for any reason or no reason, one of the names of potential arbitrators on any list submitted to the parties by the AAA as well as any person selected by the AAA to serve as an arbitrator by administrative appointment. In the event the parties cannot agree on the selection of the arbitrator from the list submitted by the AAA within 20 days after the AAA transmits to the parties its list of potential arbitrators, the selection of the arbitrator shall be made by the AAA from the remaining nominees. The selection of the arbitrator shall be made by the AAA from the remaining nominees in accordance with the parties mutual order of preference. The arbitrator shall endeavor to base his award on applicable law and judicial precedent and shall include in such award the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the award is based, and the arbitrator shall not grant any remedy or relief that a court could not grant under applicable law. The award shall be final and binding on all parties and shall not be vacated or modified (for errors of law or otherwise) except upon the grounds expressly provided in the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Each party will bear its own expenses with respect to arbitration and the parties will share equally the fees and expenses of the AAA and the arbitrator. 

  

 Section 10.9 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. The 

   ##### 

  

 

exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile, or
by .pdf or similar imaging transmission, will constitute effective execution
and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may be used in lieu of
the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the parties
transmitted by facsimile, or by .pdf or similar imaging transmission, will be
deemed to be their original signatures for any purpose whatsoever. 

   

 Section 10.10 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other and with their respective representatives and agents in connection with any steps required to be taken as part of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and the parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to the other parties such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other party such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the other parties may reasonably request, for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 10.11 _Shareholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) The Shareholder Representative shall be constituted and appointed as agent for and on behalf of each Shareholder to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement, to give and receive notices and communications, to agree to, negotiate and enter into, on behalf of the Shareholders, as applicable, amendments, consents and waivers under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to the terms set forth herein and therein, to make and receive payments on behalf of the Shareholders pursuant to the terms set forth herein and the Escrow Agreement, to take such other actions as authorized by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by a vote or written consent by the holders of a majority of the Companys capital stock, voting in the same manner as would have been voted in accordance with the organizational documents of the Company as in effect at the time of such vote, or if such vote occurs after the Closing Date, as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Majority Shareholders_ "), from time to time upon not less than ten days prior written notice to Purchaser. If at any time the Shareholder Representative resigns or becomes incapable of acting, the holders of a majority of the Companys capital stock, voting in the same manner as would have been voted in accordance with the organizational documents of the Company as in effect at the time of such vote, or if such vote occurs after the Closing Date, as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date shall choose another Person, to act as the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Company Indemnified Persons may not make a claim for indemnity against Purchaser under _Section 9.3_ except through the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder Representative may enforce, prosecute and settle any such claim without any directions from the Company Indemnified Persons, and all acts and decisions of the Shareholder Representative in connection with such matter shall be binding on all the Company Indemnified Persons. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder Representative shall receive no compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the Shareholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Shareholders. 

  

 (b) The Shareholder Representative will be entitled to engage such counsel, accountants, experts and other agents as the Shareholder Representative deems necessary or proper in connection with performing its obligations hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, and will be promptly reimbursed by the Shareholders for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred by the Shareholder Representative in such capacity upon demand, pro rata based upon each such holders pro rata share of the total outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Closing Date. The Shareholder Representative may act pursuant to the advice of
counsel with respect to any matter relating to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and will not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in
good faith in accordance with such advice. Each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock shall indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder Representative
pro rata based upon such holders pro rata share of the total outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock as of the Closing Date, from any and all
Damages that are incurred by the Shareholder Representative as a result of
actions taken, or actions not taken, by the Shareholder Representative
herein, except to the extent that such Damages arise from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder
Representative shall not be liable to the Shareholders for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Shareholder Representative, excluding acts which
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

   

 (c) All amounts received by the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the holders of the Converted Company Shares or Shareholders, whether under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable, will be promptly paid by the Shareholder Representative to the holders of the Converted Company Shares (pro rata based upon such holders share of the Converted Company Shares as of the Closing Date), except as provided in _Section 2.4(f)(i)_; provided, however, that the Shareholder Representative will be entitled to set off any amounts payable to the Shareholder Representative under _Section 10.11(b)_ against amounts otherwise payable to the Shareholders pursuant to this _Section 10.11(c)_. 

  

 (d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative in respect of any action under this Agreement shall constitute a decision of all the Shareholders and the other Company Indemnified Persons and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Shareholder and the other the Company Indemnified Persons, and Purchaser and the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative hereunder as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Shareholder and the other Company Indemnified Persons. Purchaser shall be able to rely conclusively on the proper distribution of such amounts by the Shareholder Representative among the Shareholders upon receipt by the Shareholder Representative of such amounts. Purchaser and Merger Sub are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person (including any Shareholder or the other Company Indemnified Persons) for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative. 

  

 (e) The Shareholder Representative waives, and acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert) any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Surviving Entity in connection with any indemnification obligations the Company may have under or in connection with this Agreement.
