-----------   1. Form of Stock Option Agreement. (Section 1.4).   2. Form
of Plan of Merger. (Section 1.1)   3. Form of Affiliate Agreement. (Sections
8.13, 9.2(d)).      - iv -       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
REORGANIZATION  ------------------------------------   THIS AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
September 20, 2000, by and between JEFFERSON SAVINGS BANCORP, INC.
("Jefferson"), a corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware, with its principal office located in Ballwin, Missouri;
and UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION ("UPC"), a corporation organized and existing
under the Laws of the State of Tennessee, with its principal office located
in Memphis, Tennessee.    PREAMBLE  --------   The Boards of Directors
of Jefferson and UPC are of the opinion that the transactions described
herein are in the best interests of the parties to this Agreement and their
respective stockholders. This Agreement provides for the acquisition of
Jefferson by UPC pursuant to the merger (the "Merger") of Jefferson with and
into Union Planters Holding Corporation ("UPHC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of UPC organized under the Laws of the State of Tennessee. At the effective
time of the Merger, the outstanding shares of the common stock of Jefferson
shall be converted into shares of the common stock of UPC (except as
provided herein). As a result, stockholders of Jefferson shall
become stockholders of UPC, and UPHC shall continue to conduct the business
and operations of Jefferson as a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPC.
The transactions described in this Agreement are subject to the approvals
of the stockholders of Jefferson, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, and certain state regulatory authorities, and
the satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement.
It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the Merger (i)
for federal income tax purposes shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and (ii)
for accounting purposes shall be treated as a purchase transaction.  
Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to UPC\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Jefferson and UPC are entering into a stock option agreement (the "Stock
Option Agreement"), in substantially the form of Exhibit 1, pursuant to which
Jefferson is granting to UPC an option to purchase shares of Jefferson Common
Stock.   Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1
of this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the
mutual warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements set forth
herein, the Parties agree as follows:    - 1 -       ARTICLE 1 
TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER  --------------------------------   1.1
MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of this  ------ Agreement, at
the Effective Time, Jefferson shall be merged with and into UPHC in
accordance with the provisions of Section 252 of the DGCL and with the effect
provided in Section 259 of the DGCL and in accordance with the provisions of
Section 48-21-109 of the TBCA and with the effect provided in Section
48-21-108 of the TBCA (the "Merger"). UPHC shall be the Surviving Corporation
resulting from the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of
the State of Tennessee. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, which has been approved and adopted by the respective
Boards of Directors of Jefferson and UPC, and the Plan of Merger, in
substantially the form of Exhibit 2, which has been approved and adopted by
the Board of Directors of Jefferson and will be approved and adopted by the
Board of Directors of UPHC and by UPC as the sole shareholder of UPHC. UPC
shall cause UPHC to execute the Plan of Merger prior to the Effective
Time.   1.2 TIME AND PLACE OF CLOSING. The consummation of the 
------------------------- Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 9:00
A.M., Central Time, on the date that the Effective Time occurs (or the
immediately preceding day if the Effective Time is earlier than 9:00 A.M.,
Central Time), or at such other time as the Parties, acting through their
duly authorized officers, may mutually agree. The place of Closing shall be
at such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties.   1.3
EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger and the other transactions 
-------------- contemplated by this Agreement shall become effective on the
date and at the time the Certificate of Merger shall become effective with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Articles of
Merger shall become effective with the Secretary of State of the State
of Tennessee (the "Effective Time"). Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the
duly authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur on or before the
15th business day (as designated by UPC) following the last to occur of (i)
the effective date (including expiration of any applicable waiting period) of
the last required Consent of any Regulatory Authority having authority over
and approving or exempting the Merger and (ii) the date on which the
stockholders of Jefferson approve the matters relating to this Agreement
required to be approved by such stockholders by applicable Law.   1.4
EXECUTION OF STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT. Immediately 
----------------------------------- after the execution of this Agreement and
as a condition hereto, Jefferson is executing and delivering to UPC the Stock
Option Agreement.   1.5 RESTRUCTURE OF TRANSACTION. UPC shall, in its 
-------------------------- reasonable discretion, have the unilateral right
to revise the structure of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement in order
to achieve tax benefits or for any other reason which UPC may deem advisable;
provided, however, that UPC shall not have the right, without the approval of
the Board of Directors of Jefferson and, if required by applicable Law,
the holders of the Jefferson Common Stock, to make any revision to
the structure of the Merger which: (i) changes the amount of
the consideration which the holders of shares of Jefferson Common Stock
are entitled to receive (determined in the    - 2 -     manner
provided in Section 3.1 of this Agreement); (ii) changes the intended tax-
free effects of the Merger to UPC, Jefferson, or the holders of shares of
Jefferson Common Stock; (iii) would permit UPC to pay the consideration other
than by delivery of UPC Common Stock registered with the SEC (in the manner
described in Section 4.1 of this Agreement); (iv) would be materially adverse
to the interests of Jefferson or adverse to the holders of shares of
Jefferson Common Stock; (v) would materially impede or delay consummation of
the Merger; or (vi) would require a vote of UPC\'s stockholders under
relevant state Law. UPC may exercise this right of revision by giving written
notice to Jefferson in the manner provided in Section 11.8 of this Agreement
which notice shall be in the form of an amendment to this Agreement or in the
form of an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Reorganization. The
Parties shall execute such documents as necessary to effect the revised
structure of the Merger, including such changes as required to retain the
tax-free character of the Merger.    ARTICLE 2  TERMS OF MERGER 
---------------   2.1 CHARTER. The Charter of UPHC in effect immediately 
------- prior to the Effective Time shall be the Charter of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time until otherwise amended or
repealed.   2.2 BYLAWS. The Bylaws of UPHC in effect immediately 
------ prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time until otherwise amended or
repealed.   2.3 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The directors of UPHC in 
---------------------- office immediately prior to the Effective Time,
together with such additional individuals thereafter elected, shall serve as
the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time
in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers
of UPHC in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, together
with such additional individuals thereafter elected, shall serve as
the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective
Time in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   
ARTICLE 3  MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES  ---------------------------   3.1
CONVERSION OF SHARES. Subject to the provisions of 
-------------------- this Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of UPC or Jefferson, or the
stockholders of either of the foregoing, the shares of the constituent
corporations shall be converted as follows:   (a) Each share of UPC Common
Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and  outstanding from and after the Effective Time and be
unaffected  solely as a result of the Merger.    - 3 -         (b)
Each share of UPHC Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain issued and  outstanding from and after the
Effective Time and be unaffected  solely as a result of the Merger.   (c)
Each share of Jefferson Common Stock (including any  associated Preferred
Stock Purchase Rights, but excluding shares  held by any Jefferson Company or
any UPC Company, in each case  other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a
result of debts  previously contracted) issued and outstanding at the
Effective  Time shall be converted into .433 of a share of UPC Common Stock 
(as possibly adjusted pursuant to Section 10.1(g) of this Agreement,  the
"Exchange Ratio"). Pursuant to the UPC Rights Agreement, each  share of UPC
Common Stock issued in connection with the Merger upon  conversion of
Jefferson Common Stock shall be accompanied by a UPC  Right.   3.2 ANTI-
DILUTION PROVISIONS. In the event Jefferson 
------------------------ changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of shares of Jefferson Common Stock issued and outstanding prior
to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, or similar transaction with respect to such stock, the
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted. In the event UPC changes
(or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of UPC
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, or similar
transaction with respect to such stock and the record date therefor (in the
case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a
stock split or similar recapitalization for which a record date is
not established) shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange
Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.   3.3 SHARES HELD BY JEFFERSON OR
UPC. Each of the shares  ------------------------------- of Jefferson Common
Stock held by any Jefferson Company or by any UPC Company, in each case other
than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted,
shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration
shall be issued in exchange therefor.   3.4 FRACTIONAL SHARES.
Notwithstanding any other  ----------------- provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Jefferson Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of UPC Common Stock (after taking into account all certificates
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of UPC Common
Stock multiplied by the market value of one share of UPC Common Stock at the
Effective Time. The market value of one share of UPC Common Stock at the
Effective Time shall be the last sale price of UPC Common Stock on the NYSE-
Composite Transactions List (as reported by The Wall Street Journal or, if
not reported thereby, any other authoritative source selected by UPC) on
the last trading day preceding the Effective Time. No such holder will
be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as
a stockholder in respect of any fractional shares.    - 4 -      3.5
CONVERSION OF STOCK RIGHTS.  --------------------------   (a) At the
Effective Time, each award, option, or other right to purchase or acquire
shares of Jefferson Common Stock pursuant to stock options, stock
appreciation rights, or stock awards ("Jefferson Rights") granted by
Jefferson under the Jefferson Stock Plans, which are outstanding at the
Effective Time, whether or not exercisable, shall be, at the election of the
holder of such Jefferson Right either (i) canceled in exchange for a cash
payment for each share of Jefferson Common Stock subject to such Jefferson
Right (the "Option Settlement Payment") or (ii) converted into and become
rights with respect to UPC Common Stock, and UPC shall assume each Jefferson
Right, in accordance with the Jefferson Stock Plans and stock option
agreement by which it is evidenced (the "Conversion Option"). A holder of
a Jefferson Right must make such election in writing delivered to UPC
no later than 5:00 P.M., Central Time, on the fifth day prior to the day
on which the Effective Time occurs. To the extent a holder does not provide
UPC with such written election, that holder shall receive the Option
Settlement Payment for each share of Jefferson Common Stock subject to any
Jefferson Right held by such holder. The Option Settlement Payment shall be
equal to the difference between (i) the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio and
(2) the Option Settlement Closing Price and (ii) the price per share of
Jefferson Common Stock pursuant to which the holder of such Jefferson Right
may purchase the shares of Jefferson Common Stock to which such Jefferson
Right relates. At the Effective Time, each such Jefferson Right for which the
holder has selected the Option Settlement Payment shall no longer represent
the right to purchase shares of Jefferson Common Stock, but in lieu
thereof shall represent only the nontransferable right to receive the
Option Settlement Payment, which payment (without interest) shall be made
to such holder within five business days after the Effective Time
upon presentation of the agreement representing such Jefferson Right
for cancellation.   (b) With respect to the Conversion Option,
the Jefferson Stock Plans shall be amended hereby such that from and
after the Effective Time, (i) UPC and its Salary and Benefits Committee
shall be substituted for Jefferson and the committee of Jefferson\'s Board
of Directors (including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors
of Jefferson) administering such Jefferson Stock Plan, (ii) each
Jefferson Right assumed by UPC may be exercised solely for shares of UPC
Common Stock (or cash in the case of stock appreciation rights), (iii)
the number of shares of UPC Common Stock subject to such Jefferson
Right shall be equal to the number of shares of Jefferson Common Stock
subject to such Jefferson Right immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounding down to the nearest
whole share, and (iv) the per share exercise price shall be adjusted
by dividing the per share exercise (or threshold) price under each
such Jefferson Right by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the
nearest cent. Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (iii) and (iv) of
the first sentence of this Section 3.6(b), each Jefferson Right which is
an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section 424
of the Internal Revenue Code, so as not to constitute a
modification, extension, or renewal of the option, within the meaning of
Section 424(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. UPC agrees to take all
necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.5(b).   (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
UPC shall deliver to the participants in each Jefferson Stock Plan selecting
the Conversion Option an appropriate notice setting forth such participant\'s
rights pursuant thereto and the grants pursuant    - 5 -     to such
Jefferson Stock Plan shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by Section 3.5(a) and (b)
after giving effect to the Merger), and UPC shall comply with the terms of
each Jefferson Stock Plan to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject
to the provisions of, such Jefferson Stock Plan, that Jefferson Rights which
qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to
qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time. At or prior to
the Effective Time, UPC shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance sufficient shares of UPC Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of Jefferson Rights assumed by it in accordance with this Section 3.5. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, UPC shall file a
registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of UPC
Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its reasonable efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.   (d) All
restrictions or limitations on transfer with respect to Jefferson Common
Stock awarded under the Jefferson Stock Plans or any other plan, program, or
arrangement of any Jefferson Company, to the extent that such restrictions or
limitations shall not have already lapsed, and except as otherwise expressly
provided in such plan, program, or arrangement, shall remain in full force
and effect with respect to shares of UPC Common Stock into which such
restricted stock is converted pursuant to Section 3.1 of this
Agreement.    ARTICLE 4  EXCHANGE OF SHARES  ------------------   4.1
EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably  ------------------- practicable
after the Effective Time, UPC and Jefferson shall cause the exchange agent
selected by UPC (the "Exchange Agent") to mail to the former stockholders of
Jefferson appropriate transmittal materials (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
theretofore representing shares of Jefferson Common Stock shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent). If any
certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid, or destroyed, upon receipt
of (i) an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such certificate to
be lost, mislaid, stolen, or destroyed, (ii) such guarantee as UPC or the
Exchange Agent may require, including an open penalty lost securities bond,
as indemnity, and (iii) any other documents necessary to evidence and effect
the bona fide exchange thereof, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder
the consideration into which the shares represented by such lost, stolen,
mislaid, or destroyed certificate shall have been converted. The Exchange
Agent may establish such other reasonable and customary rules and procedures
in connection with its duties as it may deem appropriate. After the Effective
Time, each holder of shares of Jefferson Common Stock (other than shares to
be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement) issued and outstanding
at the Effective Time shall surrender the certificate or certificates
representing such shares to the Exchange Agent and shall promptly upon
surrender thereof receive in exchange therefor the consideration provided in
Section 3.1 of this Agreement, together with all undelivered dividends
or distributions in respect of such shares (without interest
thereon) pursuant to Section 4.2 of this Agreement. To the extent required
by Section 3.4 of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Jefferson
Common Stock issued and outstanding at the    - 6 -     Effective
Time also shall receive, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares, cash in lieu of any fractional share of UPC Common
Stock to which such holder may be otherwise entitled (without interest). UPC
shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former
holder of Jefferson Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until
such holder surrenders such holder\'s certificate or certificates
representing the shares of Jefferson Common Stock for exchange as provided in
this Section 4.1. The certificate or certificates of Jefferson Common Stock
so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may require. Any
other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder
of Jefferson Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property
Law.   4.2 RIGHTS OF FORMER JEFFERSON STOCKHOLDERS. At the 
--------------------------------------- Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Jefferson shall be closed as to holders of Jefferson Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Jefferson Common
Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 of
this Agreement, each certificate theretofore representing shares of Jefferson
Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 of
this Agreement) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided
in Sections 3.1 and 3.4 of this Agreement in exchange therefor,
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time which have been declared or made by Jefferson in
respect of such shares of Jefferson Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. To
the extent permitted by Law, former stockholders of record of
Jefferson shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting
of UPC stockholders the number of whole shares of UPC Common Stock into
which their respective shares of Jefferson Common Stock are
converted, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their
certificates representing Jefferson Common Stock for certificates
representing UPC Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by UPC on
the UPC Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but
beginning 30 days after the Effective Time no dividend or other distribution
payable to the holders of record of UPC Common Stock as of any time
subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any
certificate representing shares of Jefferson Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time until such holder surrenders such
certificate for exchange as provided in Section 4.1 of this Agreement.
However, upon surrender of such Jefferson Common Stock certificate, both the
UPC Common Stock certificate (together with all such undelivered
dividends or other distributions without interest) and any undelivered
dividends and cash payments to be paid for fractional share interests
(without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to each
share represented by such certificate.    - 7 -      ARTICLE 5 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF JEFFERSON 
-------------------------------------------   Except as set forth in the
Jefferson Disclosure Memorandum referencing a specific section of this
Agreement, Jefferson hereby represents and warrants to UPC as follows:  
5.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING, AND POWER. Jefferson is a 
--------------------------------- corporation duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and
has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted and to own, lease, and operate its Material Assets. Jefferson is
duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a foreign corporation in
good standing in the States of the United States and foreign jurisdictions
where the character of its Assets or the nature or conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except for
such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson.   5.2 AUTHORITY; NO BREACH BY
AGREEMENT.  ---------------------------------   (a) Jefferson has the
corporate power and authority necessary to execute, deliver, and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the Plan of Merger and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery,
and performance of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and
therein, including the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action in respect thereof on the part of
Jefferson, subject to the approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger
by holders of the requisite number of shares of Jefferson Common
Stock, voting together as one class, as required by Law, which is the
only stockholder vote required for approval of this Agreement and the Plan
of Merger and consummation of the Merger by Jefferson. Subject to
such requisite stockholder approval, this Agreement and the Plan of
Merger represent legal, valid, and binding obligations of
Jefferson, enforceable against Jefferson in accordance with their respective
terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
conservatorship, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally and except that the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought).  
(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Plan of
Merger by Jefferson, nor the consummation by Jefferson of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance by Jefferson with any of the
provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of
any provision of Jefferson\'s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or (ii)
constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to,
or result in the creation of any Lien on any Asset of any Jefferson Company
under, any Contract or Permit of any Jefferson Company, where such Default
or Lien, or any failure to obtain such Consent, is reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Jefferson, or (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite Consents referred
to in Section 9.1(b) of    - 8 -     this Agreement, violate any Law
or Order applicable to any Jefferson Company or any of their respective
Material Assets.   (c) Other than in connection or compliance with
the provisions of the Securities Laws, applicable state corporate,
banking and securities Laws, and rules of the NASD, and other than
Consents required from Regulatory Authorities, and other than notices to
or filings with the Internal Revenue Service or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation with respect to any employee benefit plans, or under the HSR Act,
and other than Consents, filings, or notifications which, if not obtained or
made, are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson, no notice to, filing with, or Consent
of, any public body or authority is necessary for the consummation by
Jefferson of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger.   5.3 CAPITAL STOCK.  -------------  
(a) The authorized capital stock of Jefferson consists, as of the date of
this Agreement, of (i) 20,000,000 shares of Jefferson Common Stock, of which
10,100,112 shares are issued and 9,966,205 shares are outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement and, not more than 10,453,108 shares will be issued
and outstanding at the Effective Time, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of Jefferson
Preferred Stock, of which no shares are issued and outstanding as of the date
of this Agreement and no shares will be issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time. All of the issued and outstanding shares of
Jefferson Common Stock are duly and validly issued and outstanding and are
fully paid and nonassessable under the DGCL. None of the outstanding
shares of Jefferson Common Stock has been issued in violation of any
preemptive rights of the current or past stockholders of Jefferson.   (b)
Except (i) as set forth in Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement, (ii) with
respect to shares of Jefferson Common Stock issuable under the outstanding
options under the Jefferson Stock Plans, or (iii) as provided pursuant to the
Stock Option Agreement or the Jefferson Rights Agreement, there are no shares
of capital stock or other equity securities of Jefferson outstanding and no
outstanding Jefferson Rights relating to the capital stock of Jefferson.  
5.4 JEFFERSON SUBSIDIARIES. Jefferson has disclosed in 
---------------------- Section 5.4 of the Jefferson Disclosure Memorandum all
of the Jefferson Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. Jefferson or
one of its Subsidiaries owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of each Jefferson Subsidiary. No equity securities of
any Jefferson Subsidiary are or may become required to be issued (other
than to another Jefferson Company) by reason of any Rights, and there are
no Contracts by which any Jefferson Subsidiary is bound to issue (other than
to another Jefferson Company) additional shares of its capital stock or
Rights or by which any Jefferson Company is or may be bound to transfer any
shares of the capital stock of any Jefferson Subsidiary (other than to
another Jefferson Company). There are no Contracts relating to the rights of
any Jefferson Company to vote or to dispose of any shares of the capital
stock of any Jefferson Subsidiary. All of the shares of capital stock of each
Jefferson Subsidiary held by a Jefferson Company are duly authorized, validly
issued, and fully paid and, except as provided in statutes pursuant to which
depository institution Subsidiaries are organized, nonassessable under the
applicable corporation Law of the jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary
is incorporated    - 9 -    or organized and are owned by the
Jefferson Company free and clear of any Lien. Each Jefferson Subsidiary is
either a federal savings bank or a corporation, and is duly organized,
validly existing, and (as to corporations) in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized, and has the
corporate power and authority necessary for it to own, lease, and operate its
Material Assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. Each
Jefferson Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as
a foreign corporation in good standing in the States of the United
States and foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or
the nature or conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified
or licensed, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be
so qualified or licensed is not reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson. Each Jefferson
Subsidiary that is a depository institution is an "insured depository
institution" as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and applicable
regulations thereunder, and the deposits in which are insured by the Bank
Insurance Fund or Savings Association Insurance Fund.   5.5 SEC FILINGS;
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ---------------------------------   (a) Jefferson
has filed and made available to UPC all forms, reports, and documents

the time filed, complied in all Material respects with the applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be, and (ii)
did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain
any untrue statement of a Material fact or omit to state a Material fact
required to be stated in such Jefferson SEC Reports or necessary in order to
make the statements in such Jefferson SEC Reports, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except
for Jefferson Subsidiaries that are registered as a broker, dealer,

the Jefferson Subsidiaries, none of Jefferson\'s Subsidiaries is required
to file any forms, reports, or other documents with the SEC.   (b) Each of
the Jefferson Financial Statements (including, in each case, any related

was prepared or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements, or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and fairly
presented or will fairly present the consolidated financial position of
Jefferson and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or
are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not
or are not expected to be Material in amount or effect.   5.6 ABSENCE OF
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. No Jefferson 
---------------------------------- Company has any Liabilities that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Jefferson, except Liabilities which are accrued or reserved
against in the consolidated balance sheets of Jefferson as of June 30,
2000, included in the Jefferson Financial Statements or    - 10

Company has incurred or paid any Liability since June 30, 2000, except for
such Liabilities incurred or paid in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past business practice and which are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Jefferson.   5.7 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since June 
------------------------------------ 30, 2000, except as disclosed in the
Jefferson Financial Statements, (i) there have been no events, changes, or
occurrences which have had, or are reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson and (ii) the
Jefferson Companies have conducted their respective businesses in the
ordinary and usual course (excluding the incurrence of expenses in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).   5.8 TAX

on behalf of any of the Jefferson Companies have been timely filed,
or requests for extensions have been timely filed, granted, and have
not expired for periods ended on or before December 31, 1999, and, to
the Knowledge of Jefferson, all Tax Returns filed are complete and
accurate in all Material respects. All Tax Returns for periods ending on
or before the date of the most recent fiscal year end immediately
preceding the Effective Time will be timely filed by Jefferson if due on or
before the Effective Time or requests for extensions (if permitted) will
be timely filed by Jefferson if due after the Effective Time. All
Taxes shown on filed Tax Returns have been paid. There is no presently
on- going audit examination, deficiency, or refund Litigation with
respect to any Taxes, that is reasonably likely to result in a
determination that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Jefferson, except to the extent reserved against in
the Jefferson Financial Statements dated prior to the date of
this Agreement. All Taxes and other Liabilities due with respect
to completed and settled examinations or concluded Litigation have
been paid.   (b) None of the Jefferson Companies has executed an extension
or waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of
any Tax due (excluding such statutes that relate to years currently under
examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable taxing
authorities) that is currently in effect.   (c) Adequate provision for any
Taxes due or to become due for any of the Jefferson Companies for the period
or periods through and including the date of the respective Jefferson
Financial Statements has been made and is reflected on such Jefferson
Financial Statements.   (d) Each of the Jefferson Companies is in
compliance with, and its records contain all information and documents
(including properly completed IRS Forms W-9) necessary to comply with,
all applicable information reporting and Tax withholding requirements
under federal, state, and local Tax Laws, and such records identify
with reasonable specificity all accounts subject to backup withholding
under Section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code, except    - 11
-     for such instances of noncompliance and such omissions as are
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson.   (e) None of the Jefferson Companies
has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to

which adequate provision has been made.   (g) No Jefferson Company has
filed any consent under Section 341(f) of the Internal Revenue Code
concerning collapsible corporations.   (h) There has not been an ownership
change, as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 382(g), of the

the Jefferson Companies incurred a net operating loss that carries over
to any Taxable Period ending after December 31, 1998.   (i) After the date
of this Agreement, no Material election with respect to Taxes will be made
without the prior consent of UPC, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.   5.9 ASSETS. The Jefferson Companies have good and 
------ marketable title, free and clear of all Liens, to all of
their respective Assets, except where the failure to have such good
and marketable title is not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson. All
tangible properties used in the businesses of the Jefferson Companies are in
good condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and are usable in
the ordinary course of business consistent with Jefferson\'s past
practices. All Assets which are Material to Jefferson\'s business on a
consolidated basis, held under leases or subleases by any of the Jefferson
Companies, are held under valid Contracts enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and except
that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before
which any proceedings may be brought), and each such Contract is in full
force and effect. The Jefferson Companies currently maintain insurance
in amounts, scope, and coverage reasonably necessary for their
operations. None of the Jefferson Companies has received notice from any
insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that
coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated or (ii) premium costs
with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially
increased. The Assets of the Jefferson Companies include all Assets required
to operate the business of the Jefferson Companies as presently
conducted.    - 12 -      5.10 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. 
---------------------   (a) To the Knowledge of Jefferson, each
Jefferson Company, its Participation Facilities, and its Loan Properties are,
and have been, in compliance with all Environmental Laws, except
those violations which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson.   (b) There is no
Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Jefferson, threatened before any
court, governmental agency, or authority, or other forum in which any
Jefferson Company or any of its Participation Facilities has been or, with

a defendant (i) for alleged noncompliance (including by any
predecessor) with any Environmental Law or (ii) relating to the release into
the environment of any Hazardous Material, whether or not occurring at,
on, under, or involving a site owned, leased, or operated by any
Jefferson Company or any of its Participation Facilities, except for
such Litigation pending or threatened that is not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Jefferson.   (c) There is no Litigation pending, or to the Knowledge of
Jefferson, threatened before any court, governmental agency, or board, or
other forum in which any of its Loan Properties (or Jefferson in respect of
such Loan Property) has been or, with respect to threatened Litigation, may
reasonably be expected to be named as a defendant or potentially responsible
party (i) for alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with any
Environmental Law or (ii) relating to the release into the environment of any
Hazardous Material, whether or not occurring at, on, under, or involving a
Loan Property, except for such Litigation pending or threatened that is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson.   (d) To the Knowledge of Jefferson,

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Jefferson is duly registered  -------------------- as
a unitary savings and loan holding company under the SLHCA and subject to
regulation by the OTS. Each Jefferson Company has in effect all Permits
necessary for it to own, lease, or operate its Material Assets and to carry
on its business as now conducted, except for those Permits the absence of
which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson, and there has occurred no Default under
any such Permit, other than Defaults which are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Jefferson. None of the Jefferson Companies:   (a) is in violation of any
Laws, Orders, or Permits  applicable to its business or employees conducting
its business,  except for violations which are not reasonably likely to
have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on 
Jefferson; and   (b) has received any notification or communication from 
any agency or department of federal, state, or local government or  any
Regulatory Authority or the staff thereof (i) asserting that  any Jefferson

governmental authority or Regulatory Authority  enforces, where such
noncompliance is reasonably likely to have,  individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on  Jefferson, (ii) threatening to
revoke any Permits, the revocation  of which is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson,
or  (iii) requiring any Jefferson Company (x) to enter into or consent  to
the issuance of a cease and desist order, formal agreement,  directive,
commitment, or memorandum of understanding, or (y) to  adopt any Board
resolution or similar undertaking, which restricts  materially the conduct of
its business, or in any manner relates  to its capital adequacy, its credit
or reserve policies, its  management, or the payment of dividends.   5.12
LABOR RELATIONS. No Jefferson Company is the  --------------- subject of any
Litigation asserting that it or any other Jefferson Company has committed an
unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act
or comparable state Law) or seeking to compel it or any other Jefferson
Company to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of
employment, nor is any Jefferson Company a party to or bound by any
collective bargaining agreement, Contract, or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is there any
strike or other labor dispute involving any Jefferson Company, pending or, to
the Knowledge of Jefferson, threatened, or to the Knowledge of Jefferson, is
there any activity involving any Jefferson Company\'s employees seeking to
certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in any other
organization activity.   5.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. 
----------------------   (a) Jefferson has disclosed to UPC in writing
prior to the execution of the Agreement and in Section 5.13 of the
Jefferson Disclosure Memorandum, and has delivered or made available to UPC
prior to the execution of this Agreement correct and complete copies in
each case of, all Material Jefferson Benefits Plans. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Jefferson Benefit Plans" means all pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, employee
stock ownership, severance pay, vacation, bonus, or other incentive plan,
all    - 14 -     other written employee programs or agreements, all
medical, vision, dental, or other health plans, all life insurance plans, and
all other employee benefit plans or fringe benefit plans, including,
without limitation, "employee benefit plans" as that term is defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or
contributed to by, any Jefferson Company for the benefit of employees,
retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors, or other
beneficiaries and under which employees, retirees, dependents, spouses,
directors, independent contractors, or other beneficiaries are eligible to
participate. Any of the Jefferson Benefit Plans which is an "employee welfare
benefit plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA, or an
"employee pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA, is referred to herein as a "Jefferson ERISA Plan." Any Jefferson ERISA
Plan which is also a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of
the Internal Revenue Code or Section 3(35) of ERISA) is referred to herein as
a "Jefferson Pension Plan." Neither Jefferson nor any Jefferson Company has
an "obligation to contribute" (as defined in ERISA Section 4212) to a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA Sections 4001(a)(3) and 3(37)(A)).
Each "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA,
maintained by any Jefferson Company at any time during the last six years
that was intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code and with respect to which any Jefferson Company has any Liability, is
disclosed as such in Section 5.13 of the Jefferson Disclosure Memorandum.  
(b) Jefferson has delivered or made available to UPC prior to the execution
of this Agreement correct and complete copies of the following documents: (i)
all trust agreements or other funding arrangements for such Jefferson Benefit
Plans (including insurance contracts), and all amendments thereto, (ii) with
respect to any such Jefferson Benefit Plans or amendments thereto, all
determination letters, rulings, opinion letters, information letters, or
advisory opinions issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the United
States Department of Labor, or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
after December 31, 1994, (iii) annual reports or returns, audited or
unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations and reports, and
summary annual reports prepared for any Jefferson Benefit Plan with respect
to the most recent plan year, and (iv) the most recent summary
plan descriptions and any modifications thereto.   (c) All Jefferson
Benefit Plans are in Material compliance with the applicable terms of ERISA,
the Internal Revenue Code, and any other applicable Laws, the breach or
violation of which is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson. Each Jefferson ERISA Plan
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, and Jefferson is not aware of any circumstances
which could reasonably result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter. Each trust created under any Jefferson ERISA
Plan has been determined to be exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code and Jefferson is not aware of any
circumstance which could reasonably result in revocation of such exemption.
With respect to each Jefferson Benefit Plan to the Knowledge of Jefferson,
no event has occurred which could reasonably give rise to a loss of
any intended Tax consequences under the Internal Revenue Code or to any
Tax under Section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code that is
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Jefferson. There is no Material pending or, to    - 15
-     the Knowledge of Jefferson, threatened Litigation (other than
routine claims for benefits) relating to any Jefferson ERISA Plan.   (d) No
Jefferson Company has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Jefferson
Benefit Plan that, assuming the Taxable Period of such transaction expired as
of the date of this Agreement, would subject any Jefferson Company to a
Material tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in amounts which are reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Jefferson. Neither Jefferson nor, to the Knowledge of Jefferson,
any administrator or fiduciary of any Jefferson Benefit Plan (or any
agent of any of the foregoing) has engaged in any transaction, or acted
or failed to act in any manner which could subject Jefferson to any
direct or indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of
any fiduciary, co-fiduciary, or other duty under ERISA, where
such Liability, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson. Except as disclosed
under Section 5.13 of the Jefferson Disclosure Memorandum, no oral or
written representation or communication with respect to any aspect of
the Jefferson Benefit Plans has been made to employees of any
Jefferson Company which is not in accordance with the written or
otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such plans, where any Liability
with respect to such representation or disclosure is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson.   (e) No Jefferson Pension
Plan has any "unfunded current liability," as that term is defined in Section
302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA, and the fair market value of all benefits (whether
vested or not) accrued to date by all present or former participants in such
Jefferson Pension Plan exceeds the plan\'s "benefit liabilities" as that term
is defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA. For this purpose,
the assumptions for valuing plan Assets or Liabilities shall be
the assumptions which would be used by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation in an involuntary plan termination under ERISA Section
4042. Since the date of the most recent actuarial valuation, there has
been (i) no Material change in the financial position or funded status of
any Jefferson Pension Plan, (ii) no change in the actuarial assumptions
with respect to any Jefferson Pension Plan, and (iii) no increase in
benefits under any Jefferson Pension Plan as a result of plan amendments
or changes in applicable Law, any of which is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Jefferson. Neither any Jefferson Pension Plan nor any "single-
employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently
or formerly maintained by any Jefferson Company, or the single-employer plan
of any entity which is considered one employer with Jefferson under Section
4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of
ERISA (a "Jefferson ERISA Affiliate") has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302
of ERISA (whether or not waived). All contributions with respect to a
Jefferson Pension Plan or any single- employer plan of a Jefferson ERISA
Affiliate have or will be timely made and there is no lien or expected to be
a lien under Internal Revenue Code Section 412(n) or ERISA Section 302(f) or
Tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 4971. No Jefferson Company has
provided, or is required to provide, security to a Jefferson Pension Plan or
to any single-employer plan of a Jefferson ERISA Affiliate pursuant
to Section 401(a)(29) of the Internal Revenue Code. All premiums required to
be paid under    - 16 -     ERISA Section 4006 have been timely paid
by Jefferson, except to the extent any failure would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Jefferson.   (f) No Liability under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by any Jefferson Company with respect to
any defined benefit plan currently or formerly maintained by any of them
or by any Jefferson ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in
full (other than Liability for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
premiums, which have been paid when due) except to the extent any failure
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson.   (g) No Jefferson
Company has any obligations for retiree health and retiree life benefits
under any of the Jefferson Benefit Plans other than with respect to benefit
coverage mandated by applicable Law.   (h) Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will, by themselves, (i) result in any payment
(including, without limitation, severance, golden parachute, or otherwise)
becoming due to any director or any employee of any Jefferson Company from
any Jefferson Company under any Jefferson Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Jefferson Benefit Plan,
or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefit.   5.14 MATERIAL CONTRACTS. None of the Jefferson Companies, 
------------------ nor any of their respective Assets, businesses, or
operations, is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or receives benefits
under, (i) any employment, severance, termination, consulting, or
retirement Contract providing for aggregate payments to any Person in any
calendar year in excess of $100,000, (ii) any Contract relating to the
borrowing of money by any Jefferson Company or the guarantee by any
Jefferson Company of any such obligation (other than Contracts evidencing
deposit liabilities, purchases of federal funds, fully-secured
repurchase agreements, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances of
depository institution Subsidiaries, trade payables, and Contracts relating
to borrowings or guarantees made in the ordinary course of business),
and (iii) any other Contract or amendment thereto that would be required
to be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by Jefferson with the SEC
as of the date of this Agreement that has not been filed or incorporated
by reference as an exhibit to Jefferson\'s Form 10-K filed for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, or in another SEC Document (together
with all Contracts referred to in Sections 5.9 and 5.13(a) of this
Agreement, the "Jefferson Contracts"). With respect to each Jefferson
Contract: (i) the Contract is in full force and effect; (ii) no Jefferson
Company is in Default thereunder, other than Defaults which are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Jefferson; (iii) no Jefferson Company has repudiated or
waived any Material provision of any such Contract; and (iv) no other party
to any such Contract is, to the Knowledge of Jefferson, in Default in
any respect, other than Defaults which are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Jefferson, or, to the Knowledge of Jefferson, has repudiated or
waived any Material provision thereunder.    - 17 -      5.15 LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.  -----------------   (a) There is no Litigation instituted or
pending, or, to the Knowledge of Jefferson, threatened (or unasserted
but considered probable of assertion and which if asserted would have
at least a reasonable probability of an unfavorable outcome to any Jefferson
Company) against any Jefferson Company, or against any Asset, employee
benefit plan, interest, or right of any of them, that is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Jefferson, nor are there any Orders of any Regulatory Authorities, other
governmental authorities, or arbitrators outstanding against any Jefferson
Company, that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Jefferson.   (b) Section 5.15(b) of
the Jefferson Disclosure Memorandum includes a summary report of all
Litigation as of the date of this Agreement to which any Jefferson Company is
a party and which names a Jefferson Company as a defendant or cross-
defendant.   5.16 REPORTS. Since January 1, 1995, or the date of 
------- organization if later, each Jefferson Company has timely filed
all reports and statements, together with any amendments required to be
made with respect thereto, that it was required to file with any
Regulatory Authorities, except failures to file which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Jefferson. As of their respective dates, each of such reports
and documents, including the financial statements, exhibits, and
schedules thereto, complied in all Material respects with all applicable
Laws.   5.17 STATEMENTS TRUE AND CORRECT. None of the 
--------------------------- information supplied or to be supplied by any
Jefferson Company regarding Jefferson for inclusion in the Registration
Statement to be filed by UPC with the SEC will, when the Registration
Statement becomes effective, be false or misleading with respect to any
Material fact, or contain any untrue statement of a Material fact, or omit to
state any Material fact required to be stated thereunder or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by any Jefferson Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to Jefferson\'s stockholders in connection
with the Stockholders\' Meeting will, when first mailed to the stockholders
of Jefferson, be false or misleading with respect to any Material fact,
or contain any misstatement of Material fact, or omit to state any
Material fact required to be stated thereunder or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, or, in the case of the Proxy Statement or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of
the Stockholders\' Meeting, be false or misleading with respect to
any Material fact, or omit to state any Material fact required to be
stated thereunder or necessary to correct any Material statement in any
earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for
the Stockholders\' Meeting. All documents that any Jefferson Company
is responsible for filing with any Regulatory Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form in
all Material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.   5.18 TAX AND
REGULATORY MATTERS. No Jefferson Company or  -------------------------- any
Affiliate thereof has taken or agreed to take any action, and Jefferson has
no Knowledge of any fact or    - 18 -     circumstance that is
reasonably likely to (i) prevent the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, from being treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) materially
impede or delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to
in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement or result in the imposition of a
condition or restriction of the type referred to in the last sentence of such
Section.   5.19 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. Each Jefferson Company has 
------------------- taken all necessary action to exempt the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of Merger from any applicable
"moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "business combination," or other

the State of Delaware (collectively, "Takeover Laws").   5.20 CHARTER
PROVISIONS. Each Jefferson Company has  ------------------ taken all action
so that the entering into of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger do not and will not result in the grant of
any rights to any Person under the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, or
other governing instruments of any Jefferson Company or restrict or impair
the ability of UPC or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to
exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, shares of any Jefferson
Company that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by it.  
5.21 RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Jefferson has taken all necessary

Jefferson Rights Agreement) so that the entering into of this Agreement and
the Plan of Merger, the acquisition of shares pursuant to, or other
exercise of rights under, the Stock Option Agreement and consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do
not and will not result in any Person becoming able to exercise

or enabling or requiring the Preferred Stock Purchase Rights to be separated
from the shares of Jefferson Common Stock to which they are attached or to be
triggered or to become exercisable.   5.22 DERIVATIVES. All interest rate

ADVERSE CHANGES IN CONDITION. Each Party agrees to 
---------------------------- give written notice promptly to the other Party
upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or any of its Subsidiaries which (i) is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on it or (ii) would cause or constitute a Material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, or covenants contained herein, and to
use its reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly to remedy the same.   7.4
REPORTS. Each Party and its Subsidiaries shall file  ------- all reports
required to be filed by it with Regulatory Authorities between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective    - 29 -     Time and shall deliver
to the other Party copies of all such reports promptly after the same are
filed. If financial statements are contained in any such reports filed with
the SEC, such financial statements will fairly present the consolidated
financial position of the entity filing such statements as of the dates
indicated and the consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders\' equity, and cash flows for the periods then ended in
accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial statements to
normal recurring year-end adjustments that are not Material). As of their
respective dates, such reports filed with the SEC will comply in all Material
respects with the Securities Laws and will not contain any untrue statement
of a Material fact or omit to state a Material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Any
financial statements contained in any other reports to another
Regulatory Authority shall be prepared in accordance with Laws applicable to
such reports.    ARTICLE 8  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 
---------------------   8.1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT; PROXY STATEMENT;
STOCKHOLDER  ----------------------------------------------------- APPROVAL.
As soon as reasonably practicable after execution of
this -------- Agreement, UPC shall file the Registration Statement with the
SEC, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement
to become effective under the 1933 Act and take any action required to
be taken under the applicable state Blue Sky or securities Laws
in connection with the issuance of the shares of UPC Common Stock
upon consummation of the Merger. Jefferson shall furnish all
information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as UPC may
reasonably request in connection with such action. Jefferson shall call
a Stockholders\' Meeting, to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after

shall furnish to each other all information concerning them that they may
reasonably request in connection with such Proxy Statement, (iii) the Board
of Directors of Jefferson shall recommend to its stockholders the approval of
the matters submitted for approval, and (iv) the Board of Directors
of Jefferson shall use their reasonable efforts to obtain
such stockholders\' approval, provided that Jefferson may withdraw, modify,
or change in an adverse manner to UPC its recommendations if the Board
of Directors of Jefferson, after having consulted with and based upon
the advice of outside counsel, determines in good faith that the failure
to so withdraw, modify, or change its recommendation could
reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of Jefferson\'s Board
of Directors under applicable Law. In addition, nothing in this Section 8.1
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit accurate disclosure
by Jefferson of information that is required to be disclosed in
the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement or in any other
document required to be filed with the SEC (including, without limitation,
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9) or
otherwise required to be publicly disclosed by applicable Law or regulations

Stock pursuant to the Merger.   8.3 APPLICATIONS. As soon as reasonably
practicable  ------------ after execution of this Agreement, UPC shall
prepare and file, and Jefferson shall cooperate in the preparation and, where
appropriate, filing of, applications with all Regulatory Authorities
having jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement seeking the requisite Consents necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent required by the
HSR Act, each of the Parties will promptly file with the United States
Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice
the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated hereby and any supplemental or additional information which
may reasonably be requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of
the HSR Act.   8.4 FILINGS WITH STATE OFFICES. Upon the terms and 
-------------------------- subject to the conditions of this Agreement, UPC
shall cause UPHC to execute and file the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Articles of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee.   8.5 AGREEMENT AS TO
EFFORTS TO CONSUMMATE. Subject to  ------------------------------------- the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use, and to
cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
using its reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting
its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause
to be satisfied the conditions referred to in Article 9 of this
Agreement; provided, that nothing herein shall preclude either Party
from exercising its rights under this Agreement. Each Party shall use,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable efforts
to obtain all Consents necessary or desirable for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   8.6 INVESTIGATION AND
CONFIDENTIALITY.  ---------------------------------   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, each Party shall keep the other Party advised of all Material
developments relevant to its business and to consummation of the Merger and
shall permit the other Party to make or cause to be made such investigation
of the business and properties of it and its Subsidiaries and of
their respective financial and legal conditions as the other Party
reasonably requests, provided that such investigation shall be reasonably
related to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. No investigation by a Party
shall affect the representations and warranties of the other Party.   (b)
Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other
Party concerning its and    - 31 -     its Subsidiaries\' businesses,
operations, and financial positions and shall not use such information for
any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each
Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and
copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information
received from the other Party.   (c) Each Party agrees to give the other
Party notice as soon as practicable after any determination by it of any fact
or occurrence relating to the other Party which it has discovered
through the course of its investigation and which represents, or is
reasonably likely to represent, either a Material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of the other Party or which
has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
other Party.   (d) Neither Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client or similar privilege with respect to such
information or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, Order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty, or agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The Parties will use their reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable, in
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  
8.7 PRESS RELEASES. Prior to the Effective Time, UPC  -------------- and
Jefferson shall consult with each other as to the form and substance of any
press release or other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement
or any other transaction contemplated hereby; provided, that nothing in this
Section 8.7 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure
which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such
Party\'s disclosure obligations imposed by Law (provided such Party shall
give advance notice of such disclosure to the other Party to the extent
practicable).   8.8 CERTAIN ACTIONS. Except with respect to this 
--------------- Agreement and the Plan of Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, no Jefferson Company nor any Affiliate
thereof nor any Representative thereof retained by any Jefferson Company
shall, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage, or
knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any
inquiries or the making of any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Jefferson and its Board of Directors shall be
permitted (i) to the extent applicable, to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) to engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, if and only to
the extent that (a) Jefferson\'s Board of Directors concludes in good
faith and consistent with its fiduciary duties to Jefferson\'s
stockholders under applicable Law that such Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (b) prior to
providing any information or data to any Person in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, Jefferson\'s Board of Directors
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
containing confidentiality terms at least as stringent as those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, and (c) prior to providing any information
or data to any Person or entering into discussions or negotiations with   
- 32 -     any Person, Jefferson\'s Board of Directors notifies UPC
promptly of such inquiries, proposals, or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, any of its Representatives indicating,
in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers.
Jefferson agrees that it will promptly keep UPC informed of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers and the status and terms of any
such discussions or negotiations. Jefferson agrees that it will, and
will cause its officers, directors, and Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Jefferson
agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform
its directors, officers, key employees, agents, and Representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 8.8. Nothing in this Section
8.8 shall (i) permit Jefferson to terminate this Agreement (except
as specifically provided in Article 10) or (ii) affect any other
obligation of UPC or Jefferson under this Agreement.   8.9 TAX TREATMENT.
Each of the Parties undertakes and  ------------- agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action before or after
the Effective Time which would cause the Merger not, to be treated as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code for federal income tax purposes.   8.10 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. Each
Jefferson Company shall  ------------------- take all necessary steps to
exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of Merger
from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any
applicable Takeover Laws.   8.11 CHARTER PROVISIONS. Each Jefferson Company
shall  ------------------ take all necessary action to ensure that the
entering into of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger and the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do
not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person under
the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, or other governing instruments
of any Jefferson Company or restrict or impair the ability of UPC or any
of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of
a stockholder with respect to, shares of any Jefferson Company that may
be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by it.   8.12 RIGHTS
AGREEMENT. Jefferson shall take all  ---------------- necessary action
(including, if required, redeeming all of the outstanding Preferred Stock
Purchase Rights or amending or terminating the Jefferson Rights Agreement) so
that the entering into of this Agreement, the acquisition of shares pursuant
to the Stock Option Agreement, and consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in any Person
becoming able to exercise any Preferred Stock Purchase Rights under the
Jefferson Rights Agreement or enabling or requiring the Preferred Stock
Purchase Rights to be separated from the shares of Jefferson Common Stock
to which they are attached or to be triggered or to become exercisable.  
8.13 AGREEMENT OF AFFILIATES. Jefferson has disclosed in 
----------------------- Section 8.13 of the Jefferson Disclosure Memorandum
each Person whom it reasonably believes may be deemed an "affiliate" of
Jefferson for purposes of Rule 145 under the 1933 Act. Jefferson shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause each such Person to deliver to UPC prior
to the Effective Time, a    - 33 -     written agreement, in
substantially the form of Exhibit 3, providing that such Person will not
sell, pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of UPC Common
Stock to be received by such Person upon consummation of the Merger except in
compliance with applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. UPC shall not be required to maintain the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the 1933 Act for the
purposes of resale of UPC Common Stock by such affiliates.   8.14 EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS AND CONTRACTS. Following the 
------------------------------- Effective Time, but in no event earlier than
the consolidation of Jefferson\'s depository institution Subsidiaries with
UPC\'s depository institution Subsidiaries, UPC shall provide to officers and
employees of the Jefferson Companies (the "Continuing Employees"), employee
benefits under employee benefit plans on terms and conditions which when
taken as a whole are substantially similar to those currently provided by the
UPC Companies to their similarly situated officers and employees.
For purposes of participation, vesting, and benefit accruals (but
not accrual of benefits under UPC\'s tax-qualified retirement plan)
under such employee benefit plans, (i) service under any qualified
defined benefit or contribution plans of Jefferson shall be treated as
service under UPC\'s qualified defined benefit or contribution plans
and (ii) service under any other employee benefit plans of Jefferson
shall be treated as service under any similar employee benefit
plans maintained by UPC. UPC shall cause the UPC welfare benefit plans
that cover the Continuing Employees after the Effective Time to (i) waive
any waiting period and restrictions and limitations for
preexisting conditions or insurability and (ii) cause any deductible, co-
insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the Continuing Employees
under Jefferson\'s welfare benefit plans to be credited to such
Continuing Employees under the UPC welfare benefit plans, so as to reduce
the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-
pocket payments payable by the Continuing Employees under the UPC
welfare benefit plans. Prior to the commencement of the Continuing
Employees\' participation in the UPC employee benefit plans and programs,
the benefit coverage of, and participation in benefit plans by,
the Continuing Employees shall continue under the Jefferson Benefit
Plans, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. During
such transition period, the coverage under and participation in the
Jefferson Benefit Plans shall be deemed to provide the Continuing Employees
with benefits that are no less favorable than those offered to
other employees of UPC and its Subsidiaries. UPC shall and also shall
cause UPHC (as the survivor in the Merger) and the Jefferson Subsidiaries
to honor all employment, severance, retention, consulting, and
other compensation Contracts disclosed in Section 8.14 of the
Jefferson Disclosure Memorandum to UPC between any Jefferson Company and
any current or former director, officer, independent contractor, or
employee thereof, and all provisions of the Jefferson Benefit Plans.
The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence of this Section
8.14 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by
each person described therein.   8.15 INDEMNIFICATION. 
---------------   (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
UPC shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors, officers, employees, and agents of Jefferson or any
of Jefferson\'s Subsidiaries (each, a "Indemnified Party") (including
any person who becomes a director, officer, employee, or agent prior to
the Effective Time) against all Liabilities (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees, and expenses, judgments, fines and amounts    - 34
-     paid in settlement) arising out of actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement) to the full
extent permitted under Delaware Law and by Jefferson\'s Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws, as in effect on the date hereof and
any indemnity agreements entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
by any of the Jefferson Companies and any director, officer, employee,
or agent of any of the Jefferson Companies, including, without
limitation, provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the
defense of any Litigation. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in
which approval by UPC is required to effectuate any indemnification, UPC
shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified Party, that the
determination of any such approval shall be made by independent counsel
mutually agreed upon between UPC and the Indemnified Party.   (b) UPC and
the Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable efforts (and Jefferson
shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in
effect for a period of three years after the Effective Time, Jefferson\'s
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy (provided that
UPC and the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor (i) policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are substantially no less advantageous or (ii) with the consent of
Jefferson given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect
to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective
Time and covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance;
provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make
aggregate annual premium payments for such three-year period in respect of
such policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion
related to Jefferson\'s directors and officers, 150% of the annual premium
payments on Jefferson\'s current policy in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, UPC
shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies
of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance obtainable for a
premium equal to the Maximum Amount.   (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 8.15, upon
learning of any such Liability or Litigation, shall promptly notify UPC
thereof, provided that the failure so to notify shall not affect the
obligations of UPC under this Section 8.15 unless and to the extent such
failure materially increases UPC\'s Liability under this Section 8.15. In
the event of any such Litigation (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) UPC or the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and UPC shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if UPC or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for
the Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues
which raise conflicts of interest between UPC or the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and UPC or the Surviving Corporation shall pay
all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, that UPC
shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm
of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
such Litigation, and (iii) UPC shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent; and provided further
that the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation    - 35
-     hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.   (d) The
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld.   (e)
If either UPC or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets to any
Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of either UPC or the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.15.   (f) UPC shall pay
all reasonable costs, including attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
for in this Section 8.15.   (g) The provisions of this Section 8.15 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs or representatives.    ARTICLE 9

and  --------------------  registrations with, and notifications to, all
Regulatory  Authorities required for consummation of the Merger shall have 
been obtained or made and shall be in full force and effect and  all waiting
periods required by Law shall have expired. No  Consent obtained from any
Regulatory Authority which is necessary  to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be  conditioned or restricted in a manner
(excluding requirements  relating to the raising of additional capital or the
disposition  of Assets or deposits) which in the reasonable good faith
judgment  of the Board of Directors of UPC would so materially adversely 
impact the economic or business benefits of the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement so as to render inadvisable the  consummation of the
Merger.    - 36 -      (c) CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Each Party shall
have  ----------------------  obtained any and all Consents required for
consummation of the  Merger (other than those referred to in Section 9.1(b)
of this  Agreement) or for the preventing of any Default under any Contract 
or Permit of such Party which, if not obtained or made, is  reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect on such
Party.   (d) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. No court or governmental or 
-----------------  Regulatory Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted,  issued, promulgated, enforced, or entered any Law or Order 
(whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) or taken any other  action
which prohibits, restricts, or makes illegal consummation  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

the 1933 Act, no stop orders suspending  the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall have been  issued, no action, suit, proceeding,

written opinion from Lewis, Rice and Fingersh, L.C. and UPC shall  have
received a written opinion from Alston and Bird LLP, in each  case, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Party to whom it  was delivered (each a "Tax
Opinion"), dated the date of the  Effective Time, substantially to the effect
that (i) the Merger  will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section  368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) no gain or loss will be 
recognized by holders of Jefferson Common Stock who exchange all  of their
Jefferson Common Stock solely for UPC Common Stock  pursuant to the Merger
(except with respect to any cash received  in lieu of a fractional share
interest in UPC Common Stock), (iii)  the tax basis of the UPC Common Stock
received by holders of  Jefferson Common Stock who exchange all of their
Jefferson Common  Stock solely for UPC Common Stock in the Merger will be the
same  as the tax basis of the Jefferson Common Stock surrendered in 
exchange for the UPC Common Stock (reduced by any amount allocable  to a
fractional share interest in UPC Common Stock for which cash  is received),
and (iv) the holding period of the UPC Common Stock  received by holders who
exchange all of their Jefferson Common  Stock solely for UPC Common Stock in
the Merger will be the same  as the holding period of the Jefferson Common
Stock surrendered in  exchange therefor, provided that such Jefferson Common
Stock is  held as a capital asset at the Effective Time. In rendering such 
Tax Opinions, such counsel shall be entitled to rely upon  representations of
officers of Jefferson and UPC reasonably  satisfactory in form and substance
to such counsel.    - 37 -      9.2 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF UPC.
