 _Section 2.6 Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_. __

 

(a) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date,
Seller will prepare (at Sellers expense) and deliver to Buyer a worksheet
setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of the Aggregate Net Working
Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount_ "), as well as a computation thereof (which computation shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the Balance Sheet (provided that in the event of a conflict
between GAAP and consistent application thereof, GAAP shall prevail), subject
to such difference in accounting principles, policies and procedures as are
set forth on _Exhibit C_ (the " _Accounting Principles_ ")), together with a
reasonably detailed explanation of, and documentation sufficient to confirm
the accuracy of the computation of, such Estimated Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount. Buyer shall have the right to reasonably and in good faith
object to the amounts contained in Sellers calculation of Estimated Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount within three (3) Business Days after Sellers
delivery thereof to Buyer. Seller shall in good faith consider any such
objections of Buyer and, if Buyer has made any reasonable objections, shall
re-issue Sellers good faith estimate of the Estimated Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
with any such revisions that Seller has determined in good faith are
appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Parties to
agree on the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall in no way
delay the Closing and the Parties hereby agree that any pre-Closing
disagreement with respect to the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount will be handled with the post-Closing adjustment mechanisms contained
herein. If (i) the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is greater
than the Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount, the Base Purchase
Price payable at Closing will be increased by an amount equal to the
difference between the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount minus
the Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount; and (ii) the Estimated
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is less than the Aggregate Target Net
Working Capital Amount, the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be
decreased by an amount equal to the difference between the Aggregate Target
Net Working Capital Amount minus the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount (such amount under either (i) or (ii) is referred to as the " _Closing
Date Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ").

 



5 (b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare (at
Buyers expense) and deliver to Seller a worksheet setting forth Buyers good
faith computation of the actual amount of the Aggregate Net Working Capital as
of the Closing Date (the " _Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount_
"), which computation shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and on the same format as set forth on _Exhibit C_ , together with
a reasonably detailed explanation of, and documentation sufficient to confirm
the accuracy of the computation of, such Proposed Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount. If within forty-five (45) days following delivery of such
worksheet and supporting documentation, Seller does not object in writing
thereto to Buyer, then the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount
shall constitute the actual amount of the Aggregate Net Working Capital as of
the Closing Date for purposes of this Agreement (the " _Final Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount_ "). If, within forty-five (45) days following
delivery of such worksheet and supporting documentation, Seller objects in
writing thereto to Buyer (describing in reasonable detail the specific line
items and values that are in dispute and the reasons for such dispute, and
proposing alternative values with respect to such specific line items) such
Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall be subject to the
objection and resolution provisions set forth in  _Section 2.6(e)_ below.

(c) If the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is not prepared and
delivered by Buyer within the sixty (60) day period set forth in _Section
2.6(b)_ above, Seller shall be entitled (but not obligated) during the forty-
five (45) day period commencing on the sixty-first (61st) day after the
Closing Date to prepare (at Sellers expense) and deliver to Buyer a worksheet
setting forth Sellers good faith computation of the Proposed Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount, which computation shall be prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles and on the same format as set forth on _Exhibit
C_ , and based upon information available to Seller, together with a
reasonably detailed explanation of, and documentation sufficient to confirm
the accuracy of the computation of, such Proposed Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount. If within thirty (30) days following delivery of such
worksheet and supporting documentation, Buyer does not object in writing
thereto to Seller, then the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount
submitted by Seller pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall constitute the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount. If, within thirty (30) days
following delivery of such worksheet and supporting documentation, Buyer
objects in writing thereto to Seller (describing in reasonable detail the
specific line items and values that are in dispute and the reasons for such
dispute, and proposing alternative values with respect to such specific line
items), such Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall be subject to
the objection and resolution provisions set forth in _Section 2.6(e)_ below.

 

(d) If neither Buyer nor Seller prepares and timely delivers a Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount in accordance with  _Section 2.6(b)_ or
_Section 2.6(c)_, above, the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount
delivered at Closing shall become the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount for all purposes hereunder.

 

(e) If Seller timely objects to Buyers Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ or if Buyer timely objects to Sellers
Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_,
then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve the
particular items and values that are identified in the applicable written
notice of objection over a twenty (20) day period commencing on delivery of
written notice of objection pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ or _Section
2.6(c)_, as the case may be. Should such negotiations not result in an
agreement as to the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount within such
twenty (20) day period (or such longer period as Buyer and Seller may mutually
agree), then either party may submit such disputed items and values to the
Neutral Auditor. Each Party agrees to promptly execute a reasonable engagement
letter, if requested to do so by the Neutral Auditor. Buyer and Seller, and
their respective Representatives, shall cooperate fully with the Neutral
Auditor. The Neutral Auditor, acting

 



6  as an expert and not an arbitrator, shall resolve such disputed items and
determine the values to be ascribed thereto, and using those values (together
with other items not in dispute) determine the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount as of the Closing Date only (prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles). The Parties hereby agree that the Neutral Auditor
shall only decide the specific disputed items, the values ascribed thereto
and using those values (together with the other items included in the
applicable Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount) determine the Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount, and the Neutral Auditors decision with
respect to such disputed items and values must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item in the applicable Proposed Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount and the notice of objection, respectively. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor
will be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. The Neutral Auditor shall be
directed to resolve the disputed items and amounts and deliver to Buyer and
Seller a written determination of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount (such determination to made consistent with this _Section 2.6(e)_, to
include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving
at such determination and to be based solely on information provided to the
Neutral Auditor by Buyer or Seller) within thirty (30) days after being
retained, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the
Parties and their respective Affiliates, and their respective Representatives,
successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
dispute resolution mechanism contained in this _Section 2.6(e)_ shall be the
exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes, if any, regarding the Aggregate
Net Working Capital, if any, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Article X_ for Losses reflected in the amount
of the Aggregate Net Working Capital or the determination of Aggregate Net
Working Capital.

 

(f) The " _Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ " shall be
calculated by computing the Closing Date Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_, but substituting the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for the Estimated Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount. The " _Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount_ " shall be the amount (positive or negative) equal to (i)
the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount minus (ii) the
Closing Date Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-
Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a positive amount,
then Buyer shall pay in cash to Seller the amount of the Post-Closing
Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-
Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a negative amount,
then Seller shall pay in cash to Buyer the amount equal to the absolute value
of the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount. Any such
net excess or deficit payment in respect of the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount will be due and payable within five (5) Business Days after the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is finally determined as provided
in this _Section 2.6(f)_ and will be payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as shall be specified by Buyer or
Seller, as applicable. Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.6(f)_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Tax Allocation Purchase Price by the
parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(g) Following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and provide each
other and, if applicable the Neutral Auditor, and their respective
Representatives, reasonable assistance and access to such books, records and
employees (including those of the Acquired Companies) as are reasonably
requested in connection with the matters addressed in this _Section 2.6_.
Consistent with the foregoing, following the Closing and until the
finalization of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
pursuant to this _Section 2.6_, Buyer shall, at Sellers expense, provide or
provide reasonable access (in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to its
business) to Seller or the Neutral Auditor (as applicable) to review
the books and records, documents and work papers related to the preparation
of the worksheet and computation of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount. Seller and the Neutral Auditor shall be entitled to make reasonable
inquiries and information requests of

 



7  Buyer regarding the worksheet setting forth the computation Amount and the
calculations set forth therein, provided that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  _Section 2.6(g)_, such access shall not include (i) access
to materials that are subject to the attorney-client, work-product or other
similar privilege or (ii) access to any working papers of any independent
accountant unless customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreements have
been first executed.

_Section 2.7 Tax Treatment; Allocation of Purchase Price_. __

(a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, since the Acquired Companies other than
FPLE Forney and Lamar are classified as entities disregarded from their
owners for federal income tax purposes, and (b) an election pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code shall be made with respect to the acquisition
of the membership interests in FPLE Forney and Lamar, the purchase and sale
of the Interests is intended to be treated for federal income tax purposes as
a purchase and sale of the Assets and liabilities of the Acquired Companies.

 

(b) Buyer shall prepare and provide to Seller within sixty (60) days after all
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section 2.6_ have been
completed in accordance with the terms thereof, a schedule (the " _Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating the amounts paid and the liabilities
assumed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
adjusted as necessary to determine the purchase price of the Purchased Assets
for federal income tax purposes (the " _Tax Allocation Purchase Price_ "),
among the Purchased Assets. 

(c) The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance
with the general principles of Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations pursuant thereto or any successor provision. Unless
Seller objects to Buyers allocation schedule within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof, such schedule shall become final. If Seller objects
to Buyers allocation within thirty (30) days of receipt, then the Parties
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to agree, within thirty (30) days of
Sellers objection to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, to an
allocation of the Tax Allocation Purchase Price among the Assets of the
Acquired Companies that is consistent with the allocation methodology provided
by Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). In the event such mutual agreement cannot
be achieved, Buyer shall engage a nationally-recognized accounting firm to
serve as an independent valuation expert to determine the Allocation, the
costs of which are to be shared equally among Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand. Once the Allocation becomes final, whether by
virtue of Sellers deemed acquiescence, by express mutual agreement of the
Parties, or by determination of the independent valuation expert, the Parties
agree that neither Buyer, Seller, nor any of their Affiliates shall take any
position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with such final Allocation. The Allocation shall be revised to take into
account subsequent adjustments to the Tax Allocation Purchase Price, including
any indemnification payments (which shall be treated for Tax purposes as
adjustments to the Purchase Price), in accordance with the provisions
of Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations pursuant
thereto or any successor provision.

such filings, shall promptly make any appropriate or necessary subsequent or
supplemental filings, and shall cooperate with each other in the preparation
of such filings in such manner as is reasonably necessary and appropriate. The
Parties shall consult with each other and shall agree in good faith upon the
timing of such filings. Buyer will pay all of the filing fees under the HSR

materially delay the approval of any Governmental Authority of any of the
aforementioned filings, and Seller shall neither cause nor permit FPLE Forney
or Lamar to be or become a "public utility" as that term is defined under the
Federal Power Act, as amended, including the regulations of the FERC
thereunder, nor shall Buyer be, or take any action to become, a "public
utility" as defined in this provision;

 



21 (iii) Subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions or restrictions
required by Law, Buyer and Seller will notify the other Party promptly upon
the receipt of (A) any comments or questions from any officials of any
Governmental Authority in connection with any filings made pursuant to this
_Section 6.1_ or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) any
request by any officials of any Governmental Authority for amendments or
supplements to any filings made pursuant to any Laws of any Governmental
Authority or answers to any questions, or the production of any documents,
relating to an investigation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any Governmental Authority. Whenever any event occurs that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing
made pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, each Party will promptly inform the
other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing promptly with the applicable
Governmental Authority such amendment or supplement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Party shall provide to the other (or the
others respective advisors) upon request copies of all correspondence between
such Party and any Governmental Authority and any productions made by such
Party or its Affiliates to any Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials
provided to the other under this _Section 6.1_ as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In addition, to
the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls, and
meetings with a Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall include Representatives of both Parties. Subject to

arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by or on behalf of
any Party; and

 

(iv) Buyer shall use all reasonable best efforts to take, in order to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require (and
reasonable best efforts as used in this paragraph shall not require) Buyer to
prevent the entry of any court order or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned, or appeal, any decree, judgment, injunction or other order that
would prevent, prohibit, restrict, or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to take or agree to undertake
any action, including entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or
other arrangement, that would (w) require the divestiture of any Assets of
Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or any of the Acquired Companies, (x) limit
Buyers freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and
control, any of the Acquired Companies or any of their Assets or businesses
or any of Buyers or its Affiliates other Assets or Business, (y) limit

22  unless specifically waived in writing by Buyer at its discretion, a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "). Without the prior written consent of Seller, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Buyer shall not
seek (or assist any other Person in seeking) to alter or enjoin the terms of,
during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Cases, the Bankruptcy Court Order or the
DIP Order in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent Buyer from
performing its obligations hereunder.

(d) Promptly following the Effective Date, Buyer will seek authorization from
the PUCT to acquire the Interests under Sections 39.158 and 39.154 of the
PURA.

_Section 6.2 Access of Buyer_.

(a) During the Interim Period, Seller will provide, and will cause the
Acquired Companies to provide, Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable
access, upon reasonable prior notice (but in no event less than five (5)
Business Days prior written notice) and during normal business hours, to the
properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies and the appropriate
officers and employees of Seller and its Affiliates who have significant
responsibility for one or more Acquired Companies, but only to the extent that
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business of Seller
and its Affiliates or the Businesses of the Acquired Companies, that such
access is reasonably related to the requesting Partys obligations and rights
hereunder, and subject to compliance with applicable Laws and Sellers or any
of its Affiliates safety policies, protocols and requirements; _provided,
however_ , that Seller shall have the right to (i) have a Representative
present for any permitted communication with employees or officers of Seller
or its Affiliates and (ii) impose reasonable restrictions and requirements
for safety purposes. Buyer shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to
have the Property surveyed and to conduct non-invasive physical inspections;
_provided, however_ , that Buyer shall not be entitled to collect any air,
soil, surface water or ground water samples nor to perform any invasive or
destructive sampling on the Property. Promptly upon completion of any such
entry, Buyer shall repair any damage caused by such entry. Any disclosure to
Buyer pursuant to the foregoing shall be subject to such disclosure (w) not
violating any applicable Laws, (x) not resulting in the waiver of any
attorney/client, work product, or similar privilege, (y) not being of
confidential information concerning the activities of Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies) that is unrelated to the Acquired
Companies, the Business of any Acquired Company, or the Projects, or (z) not

(b) During the Interim Period, in no event shall Buyer or any of Buyers
Affiliates hold any meetings with, or otherwise communicate with, any
suppliers, other vendors or customers of any Acquired Company, or any
Representatives of any Governmental Authority, regarding any Project or
Acquired Company without the prior consent of Seller (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At any such meeting
consented to by Seller, a Representative of Seller shall be entitled to
participate therein.

 

(c) Buyer assumes any and all risks of Loss associated with or arising out of
the access and other rights under this _Section 6.2_, and Buyer agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives for any and all liabilities or Losses incurred by Seller, its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives, or by any of
Buyers Representatives, for any injuries or property damage arising out of
the access and other rights under this _Section 6.2_, caused by any of
Buyers Representatives while present on the Property.

 

(d) In connection with Buyers and its Affiliates financing activities during
the Interim Period, Seller shall, and shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cause the Acquired

 



23  Companies, and its and their respective Representatives, to provide to
Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense, all cooperation reasonably requested
by Buyer and that is customary in connection with such financing activities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing in this _Section 6.2(d)_ shall
require any cooperation to the extent that it would unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of Seller or its Affiliates, including the
Acquired Companies, or otherwise impair, in any material respect, the ability
of any Representative of Seller or the Acquired Companies to carry out their
respective duties as such and (ii) none of Seller, its Affiliates or the
Acquired Companies shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee for which it is not advanced funds or incur any other liability in
connection with such financing activities. Buyer shall promptly,

cooperation provided pursuant to this _Section 6.2(d)_. All non-public
information regarding Seller and its Affiliates provided to Buyer, its
Affiliates or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.2(d)_ shall be
kept confidential by them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
except for disclosure to potential lenders, investors, attorneys, accountants,
rating agencies or their respective Representatives in connection with such
financing activities subject, where applicable, to customary confidentiality
provisions as approved in advance in writing by Seller (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all Losses actually suffered or
incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates, to the extent arising out of or
relating to (i) any action taken or cooperation provided by Seller or its
Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 6.2(d)_ or in connection with such
financing activities or (ii) any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided to Buyer in writing by Seller or the
Companies). This _Section 6.2(d)_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

_Section 6.3 Certain Restrictions_. Except as required or permitted hereby,
or as otherwise set forth in _Schedule 6.3_ , during the Interim Period,
Seller will cause the Acquired Companies and the Projects to operate in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice. Without
limiting the foregoing, except as otherwise set forth in _Schedule 6.3_ ,
required or permitted hereby or required by applicable Laws or any Material
Contract in effect as of the Effective Date or amended as permitted hereby or
as consented to by Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (except that this _Section 6.3_ shall not restrict (i)
the transfer of Excluded Items, (ii) the termination or assignment of
Excluded Contracts, (iii) the taking of any action otherwise listed below to
the extent reasonably required to accomplish any of the Permitted Transactions
or (iv) the termination of the services contemplated by  _Section 6.8_, and
no consent of Buyer will be required with respect to any matter set forth in
this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the
requirement of such consent would reasonably be expected to violate any
applicable Law), Seller will, during the Interim Period, cause the Acquired
Companies not to:

be imposed on or against any of the Purchased Assets or Interests, except with

guarantee the obligations of any other Person;

(e) except as may be required to meet the requirements of applicable Laws or

official for it or for all or any substantial part of its assets, or (ii) make

Transferrable Project Employees and made available to Buyer as of the
Effective Date;

 



25 (q) declare, set aside, make or pay any cash or non-cash dividend or other
distribution on or with respect to any of its ownership interests (other than
distributions solely among the Acquired Companies) except for NAPS
Dispositions (as defined in the Project Financing Agreement);

 

(r) enter into any Contract with any Related Party;

 

(s) delay, defer, reduce or otherwise alter in any material respect any

the Acquired Companies provided to Buyer as the Effective Date, except as

and other Governmental Authorities; or

 

(t) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may permit the Acquired Companies to
take commercially reasonable actions with respect to emergency situations so
long as Seller shall, upon receipt of notice of any such actions, promptly
inform Buyer of any such actions taken outside the ordinary course of
business.

 

 _Section 6.4 Use of Certain Names_. Within forty-five (45) days following
Closing, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to cease using the words
"FPL", "FPLE", "ESI", "NextEra", "NextEra Energy", "Energy Resources" and "FPL
Energy" and any trademark confusingly similar thereto or constituting an
abbreviation thereof, and any logos associated therewith (the " _Seller Marks_
"), including eliminating or covering the Seller Marks from the Property and
Purchased Assets and disposing of any unused stationery and literature of the
Acquired Companies bearing the Seller Marks, and thereafter, Buyer shall not,
and shall cause the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates not to, use the
Seller Marks or any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or
any Affiliate thereof, and Buyer acknowledges that it, its Affiliates and the
Acquired Companies have no rights whatsoever to use such Intellectual
Property. Without limiting the foregoing:

 

(a) Within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause any
Acquired Company whose name contains any of the Seller Marks to change its
name to a name that does not contain any of the Seller Marks.

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide
evidence that is reasonably acceptable to Seller, that Buyer has made all
filings required pursuant to paragraph (a) above with, and has provided notice
to, all applicable Governmental Authorities and all counterparties to
the Material Contracts regarding the sale of the Acquired Companies and the
Purchased Assets to Buyer and the new addresses for notice purposes.

 

 _Section 6.5 Support Obligations_.

 

(a) With respect to the NEER Guaranty, during the Interim Period, Seller and
Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause Buyers Affiliates to, use their
respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to work together to procure the
full and unconditional release, effective as of the Closing Date, of NEERs
obligations under the NEER Guaranty. For purposes of this subsection,
Commercially Reasonable Efforts shall require (i) jointly approaching Kinder
Morgan to discuss and negotiate alternative arrangements for satisfying Kinder
Morgans credit support requirements, and (ii) in support of any such
alternative credit support arrangements, Buyer offering to replace the NEER
Guaranty with a substitute guarantee from Buyer or Buyer Parent Guarantor on
terms acceptable to Kinder Morgan (provided that the maximum principal amount
guaranteed may not be increased) and, if the foregoing is not accepted by
Kinder Morgan, Buyer or Buyer Parent Guarantor offering to deliver to Kinder
Morgan

 



26  a letter of credit from a creditworthy United States bank acceptable to
Kinder Morgan for the account of Buyer or Buyer Parent Guarantor as applicant
in an amount (x) sufficient to cover the entire amount that may be payable
under the NEER Guaranty or (y) such lesser amount deemed sufficient by Kinder
Morgan, and, if such offer is accepted by Kinder Morgan, providing such letter
of credit to Kinder Morgan in connection with the Closing.

(b) If Buyer and Seller are not successful in obtaining the complete and
unconditional release of NEER from its obligations under the NEER Guaranty
prior to Closing as contemplated in _Section 6.5(a)_, then Seller or its
Affiliates, as applicable, shall cause NEER to keep in place the NEER
Guaranty, and Buyer shall deliver to Seller at the Closing, and shall keep in
place, an irrevocable, standby letter of credit in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Seller and in an amount equal to the maximum amount
of exposure under the NEER Guaranty and issued by Citibank N.A. pursuant to
Buyer Parent Guarantors debtor-in-possession credit agreement authorized by
the DIP Order or another irrevocable, standby letter of credit on
substantially similar terms from a creditworthy financial institution
reasonably acceptable to Seller (the " _Continuing Support Letter of Credit_
"); provided, however, that as a condition to the continuing maintenance of
the NEER Guaranty:

 

(i) From and after the Closing, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses that
may be suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them
become subject, resulting from, arising out of or relating to the NEER
Guaranty being in effect on or after the Closing Date (including as a result
of any draw or demand for or making of any payment by NEER under the NEER
Guaranty) with respect to the full extent of the NEER Guaranty. In
furtherance, and not limitation, of the forgoing, if the NEER Guaranty is
drawn upon in accordance with its terms after the Closing Date, upon receipt
of written notice thereof from Seller, Buyer shall pay Seller or its designee
the amount so drawn upon in accordance with its terms within five (5) Business
Days after the date of such written notice. If Buyer fails to pay Seller or
its designee within such five (5) Business Day period, Seller may draw upon or
otherwise enforce the terms of the Continuing Support Letter of Credit in
accordance with the terms thereof;

 

(ii) from and after the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall continue to use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the full and unconditional release
of NEER from its obligations under the NEER Guaranty as contemplated by
_Section 6.5(a)_; and

(iii) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, effect
any amendments or modifications or any other changes to the Contracts or
obligations to which any of the obligations under the NEER Guaranty relates to
the extent such amendment or modification would increase the liability of
NEER under the NEER Guaranty or extend the stated maturity of any obligation
to which the NEER Guaranty relates, without Sellers prior written consent
(which consent may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion).

(c) If a Continuing Support Letter of Credit is provided pursuant to _Section
6.5(b)_, at the expiration or termination of the NEER Guaranty (such that it
is no longer subject to restoration or reinstatement), Seller shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Buyer the Continuing Support Letter of Credit for
cancellation.

 

 _Section 6.6 Excluded Items_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchased Assets shall exclude
those items listed on _Schedule 6.6_ (the " _Excluded Items_ "). Seller shall
retain all benefits and liabilities with respect to the Excluded Items, and
Seller shall, prior to the Closing Date, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to cause the Acquired Companies to distribute, transfer or assign each
Excluded Item to Seller or a Non-Acquired Company Affiliate. Buyer
acknowledges that the inability of Seller to have any Excluded
Item distributed,

 



27  transferred or assigned from any Acquired Company for any reason shall not
delay Closing and any Excluded Item that Seller is unable to so distribute,
transfer or assign by the Closing shall be referred to as a " _Non-
Transferred Excluded Item_." As soon as is reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, at Sellers cost and expense, the Parties will take such actions
as are reasonably required to cause the transfer to Seller or a Non-Acquired
Company Affiliate of the Non-Transferred Excluded Items, and the removal
thereof from the sites of the Projects, if applicable. From and after the
Closing, except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall have no obligations
with respect to the Non-Transferred Excluded Items, including any obligation
to preserve or protect the Non-Transferred Excluded Items.

 

 _Section 6.7 Employee and Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, the Project Employees who are providing
services directly relating to the Projects may, in Seller or
Seller Affiliates sole discretion, continue in the same role following
Closing as employees of Seller or a Seller Affiliate. Nothing in this _Section
6.7_ shall affect the right of Seller, or any Affiliate of Seller, to
terminate the employment of any Project Employee for any reason or at any
time. At all times prior to Closing, Seller, or an Affiliate of Seller, shall
continue to have the exclusive right to control the Project Employees and make
any and all employment decisions regarding Project Employees as it shall deem
appropriate. Seller or its Affiliates shall be exclusively responsible for the
payment of all wages, provision of all benefits and compliance with all
applicable Laws with respect to the Project Employees until such Project
Employees are no longer employed by Seller or its Affiliates.

(b) Except as expressly contemplated herein or in the OandM Agreement, from the
Effective Date through the latter of a period of two (2) years from and after
the OandM Expiration or the date of termination of this Agreement (pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ if a Closing does not occur hereunder), Buyer agrees not to
solicit for hire or employment or employ, and to use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cause Buyer Service Companies and their Affiliates not to solicit
for hire or employment or employ, any Project Employee, without Sellers
prior written consent; _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall not apply to any solicitation (or any hiring
as a result of any solicitation) that consists of advertising in a newspaper
or periodical of general circulation or through similar general circulation on
the internet or otherwise not specifically directed toward any Project
Employee.

 

 _Section 6.8 Termination of Certain Services, Excluded Contracts and Other
Affiliate Transactions_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and except as contemplated with respect to the Contracts listed on
Part I of _Schedule 6.8_ (the " _Existing Affiliate Contracts_ ") and as
contemplated in the OandM Agreement, the Energy Management Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement, prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall
cause an Affiliate of Seller, as applicable, to (i) terminate, sever, or
assign to Seller or a Non-Acquired Company Affiliate effective upon or before
the Closing any services provided to any of the Acquired Companies by Seller
or a Non-Acquired Company Affiliate, including the severance of the Acquired
Companies from the insurance policies of the Non-Acquired Company
Affiliates (including those policies referred in _Section 6.10_, in
accordance with _Section 6.10_), Tax services, legal services and banking
services (to include the severance of any centralized clearance accounts) in
each case for periods prior to the Closing, (ii) (A) use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to terminate or assign to Seller or a Non-Acquired Company
Affiliate each Contract listed on Part II of _Schedule 6.8_ as specified
therein and (B) terminate or assign all Contracts between any Acquired
Company and Seller or any Non-Acquired Company Affiliate (collectively such
Contracts described in this clause (ii), the " _Excluded Contracts_ "), and
(iii) release the applicable Acquired Company from any and all liability
under the applicable Excluded Contract, in each case without any liability of
any kind on the part of any Acquired Company arising from any such
termination, severance, 

 



28  assignment or otherwise. In addition to the foregoing, prior to the Closing,
any liability of an Acquired Company to Seller or a Non-Acquired Company
Affiliate, or any receivable from an Acquired Company to Seller or a Non-
Acquired Company Affiliate, shall be satisfied or otherwise eliminated in
full.

_Section 6.9 Spare Parts_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, as may be permitted under the Project Financing Documents, prior to
the Closing, Seller shall have the right to use Spare Parts in the ordinary
course of business of the Acquired Companies or in connection with the
activities of any Project, in each case consistent with past practice. Prior
to the Closing, Seller shall cause the then current inventory of the Spare
Parts to be owned by the Acquired Companies.

 

 _Section 6.10 Insurance_. Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained in
full force and effect insurance coverage consistent with past practice for
the Acquired Companies until the Closing. From and after the Closing, all such
insurance coverage for the Acquired Companies and the Purchased Assets
relating to periods subsequent to the Closing shall no longer be provided or
maintained for any of the Acquired Companies or such Purchased Assets. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Acquired Companies and the Purchased Assets will
continue to be insured under any occurrence based third party liability
policies under which they were insured prior to Closing for any claims which
relate to events or circumstances prior to Closing, without regard to when
such claim is reported to the Acquired Companies and Purchased Assets. Buyer
shall be solely responsible for providing insurance to the Acquired Companies
after the Closing. If any claims are actually made prior to the Closing Date
under any liability insurance policy for any of the Acquired Companies, or if
there are any matters reportable under any claims made liability insurance
policy for events or circumstances relating to pre-Closing events which are
known to Seller, then Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
ensure that the applicable Acquired Company can file, notice and otherwise
continue to pursue such claims and recover proceeds under the terms of such
policies, and Seller will promptly pay over to the applicable Acquired Company
any proceeds of any insurance recovery under any such policy by Seller. If
any casualty loss occurs prior to the Closing which is insured under any
property or casualty insurance policy for any of the Acquired Companies and
claims associated with such losses have been made prior to the Closing, then
Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to ensure that the
applicable Acquired Company can file, notice and otherwise continue to pursue
such claims and recover proceeds under the terms of such policies and
reasonably cooperate with the filing and pursuit of any such claim, and
Seller will promptly pay over to the applicable Acquired Company any such
proceeds of any insurance recovery under any such policy by Seller, other than
any such proceeds that have been applied to repair or replace the property
subject to such claim.

_Section 6.11 Casualty_. If any of the Purchased Assets are damaged or
destroyed by casualty loss during the Interim Period, and the sum of (a) the
cost of restoring such damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets to a condition
reasonably comparable to their prior condition, and (b) the net present value
(calculated using the Discount Rate) of the amounts of any lost net revenues
reasonably expected to accrue after the Closing as a result of such damage or
destruction to such Purchased Assets, (a) and (b) above as estimated by a
qualified firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller (and with the costs
of such firm being paid by Buyer and Seller in equal proportion), and such sum
being net of and after giving effect to any insurance proceeds available to
the Acquired Companies for such restoration and lost profits and any Tax
benefits to the Acquired Companies related thereto (such sum, the "
_Restoration Cost_ " and the date of such estimation, the " _Restoration Cost
Estimation Date_ "), is greater than $15,000,000 but does not exceed
$131,303,723, Seller may elect either (i) to restore, repair or replace such
damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets to a condition reasonably comparable to
their prior condition (any of the foregoing, a  _"Restoration_ , _"_ and
Sellers election of a Restoration, the _"Restoration Option"_ ), or (ii)
reduce the amount of the Purchase Price by such Restoration Cost. If Seller
elects the Restoration Option, it shall notify Buyer of such election in
writing, and Seller shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to complete,
or cause to be completed, such Restoration prior to the Closing, and if the
Restoration 

 



29  can be completed on or before the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days
after the Outside Date (the " _Extended Outside Date_ "), the Closing Date
shall be postponed for the amount of time reasonably necessary to complete
such Restoration; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing Date is so
extended and such Restoration is not completed in full by the Extended Outside
Date, the Closing shall occur on or before the Extended Outside Date and the
Purchase Price will be reduced by the amount of the remaining Restoration Cost
as of the Closing (as estimated by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and Seller); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if Seller elects the
Restoration Option, Buyer shall be entitled to waive Sellers obligation to
complete the Restoration at any time within twenty (20) days following
Sellers written notice to Buyer of such election by written notice to Seller
and proceed to Closing upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ , in which case Seller
shall pay the applicable insurance proceeds with respect to such casualty to
Buyer promptly upon receipt and such casualty loss shall not affect the
Closing. If Seller elects the Restoration Option or to reduce the Purchase
Price, such casualty loss shall not affect the Closing. If Seller does
not provide Buyer written notice of its election within forty-five (45) days
after the applicable Restoration Cost Estimation Date (but in any event at
least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date), Buyer may elect to
terminate this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after the end of such
forty-five (45) day period by written notice to Seller. If the Restoration
Cost is in excess of $131,303,723, Seller may, by written notice to Buyer
within forty-five (45) days after the applicable Restoration Cost Estimation
Date (but in any event at least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date),
elect to (i) reduce the Purchase Price by the estimated Restoration Cost or
(ii) terminate this Agreement, in each case by providing written notice to
Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller does not elect to terminate
this Agreement as provided in this sentence, then Buyer may elect, by written
notice to Seller, to terminate this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days
of receipt by Buyer of Sellers notice regarding its election. If the
Restoration Cost is $15,000,000 or less, (A) Seller shall not be obligated to
repair or replace the damaged or destroyed Purchased Assets (but shall be
obligated to cooperate in the pursuit of any applicable insurance proceeds in
accordance with _Section 6.10_), (B) there shall be no reduction in the
amount of the Purchase Price, and (C) neither Buyer nor Seller shall have the
right or option to terminate this Agreement and such casualty event shall not
affect the Closing. Any cash insurance proceeds received by the Acquired
Companies with respect to any casualty subject to this _Section 6.11_ shall
be disregarded for purposes of any Aggregate Net Working Capital calculation
hereunder.

 

 _Section 6.12 Condemnation_. If any of the Purchased Assets are taken by
condemnation during the Interim Period and the sum of (a) the value of such
Purchased Assets in a condemnation proceeding and (b) to the extent not
included in the preceding clause (a), the net present value (calculated using
the Discount Rate) of the amounts of any lost net revenues reasonably
expected to accrue after the Closing as a result of such condemnation of such
Purchased Assets, (a) and (b) above as determined by a qualified firm
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller (and with the costs of such firm
being paid by Buyer and Seller in equal proportion), and such sum being net
of and after giving effect to any condemnation award proceeds to be paid to
the Acquired Companies and any Tax benefits to the Acquired Companies related
thereto (such sum, the " _Condemnation Value_ " and the date of such
estimation, the " _Condemnation Value Estimation Date_ "), is greater than
$15,000,000 but do not have a Condemnation Value in excess of $131,303,723,
Seller may elect either (i) to replace the Purchased Assets that were taken
by such condemnation with reasonably comparable Assets, or (ii) to reduce the
Purchase Price by such Condemnation Value (less, to the extent not taken into
account in calculating the Condemnation Value, the amount of any condemnation
award proceeds to be paid to the Acquired Companies and any Tax benefits to
the Acquired Companies related thereto). If Seller elects to replace the
Purchased Assets or reduce the Purchase Price, such condemnation shall not
affect the Closing. If Seller does not provide Buyer notice of its election
within forty-five (45) days after the applicable Condemnation Value Estimation
Date (but in any event at least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date),
Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days
after the end of such forty-five (45) day period by written notice to Seller.
If the Condemnation Value is in excess of 

 



30  $131,303,723, Seller may, by written notice to Buyer within forty-five (45)
days after the applicable Condemnation Value Estimation Date (but in any event
at least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date), elect to (a) reduce the
Purchase Price by such Condemnation Value less, to the extent not taken into
account in calculating the Condemnation Value, the amount of any condemnation
award proceeds to be paid to the Acquired Companies and any Tax benefits to
the Acquired Companies related thereto), or (b) terminate this Agreement, in
each case by providing written notice to Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Seller does not elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in this
sentence, then Buyer may, by written notice to Seller, terminate this
Agreement within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Buyer of Sellers notice
regarding its election. If the Condemnation Value is $15,000,000 or less, (A)
Seller shall not have the obligation to replace the Purchased Assets (but
shall be obligated to cooperate in the pursuit of any applicable condemnation
proceeds), (B) there shall be no reduction in the amount of the Purchase
Price, and (C) neither Buyer nor Seller shall have the right or option to
terminate this Agreement and such condemnation shall not affect the Closing.
Any condemnation proceeds received by the Acquired Companies with respect to
any condemnation subject to this _Section 6.12_ shall be disregarded for
purposes of any Aggregate Net Working Capital calculation hereunder.

 

 _Section 6.13 Transfer Taxes_. Seller and Buyer shall each pay any Transfer
Taxes imposed on it or any Acquired Company by Law as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but, notwithstanding any such
requirement of Law, each of Seller and Buyer shall bear half of the total of
all such Transfer Taxes. Accordingly, if either Party is required at Law to
pay more than its half of any such Transfer Taxes, the other Party shall
promptly reimburse such first Party for amounts in excess of such half. Seller
and Buyer shall timely file their own Transfer Tax Returns as required by Law
and shall notify the other Party when such filings have been made. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate and consult with each other prior to filing such
Transfer Tax Returns to ensure that all such returns are filed in a consistent
manner. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall be solely responsible for
any Transfer Taxes arising from any action to dissolve, terminate or
restructure any Acquired Company or to convey, distribute or transfer any
Assets or other rights by deed, bill of sale or otherwise to or from any
Acquired Company on or after the Closing.

_Section 6.14 Tax Matters_. Except as provided in  _Section 6.13_ relating
to Transfer Taxes:

(a) With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Taxable Period_ ") that is required
to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to any Acquired Company, (i)
Seller shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared and shall deliver such
Tax Return as so prepared to Buyer not later than seven (7) days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Return, and (ii) Buyer shall cause such Tax
Return to be executed and duly and timely filed with the appropriate Taxing
Authority and shall, subject to _Section 6.14(b)_, pay all Taxes due with
respect to the period covered by such Tax return. For the avoidance of doubt,
the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to income Tax Returns that
report the income and deductions of any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing
Taxable Period but that are required to be filed by a Person that is a direct
or indirect owner of such Acquired Company but that is not itself an Acquired
Company; such income Tax Returns shall be filed by such Person and shall not
be provided to Buyer. With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Taxable Period_ ") that is required to be filed after the Closing
Date with respect to an Acquired Company, (A) Buyer shall cause such Tax
Return to be prepared (in a manner consistent with practices followed in prior
taxable periods, except as required by applicable Law or a change in Law) and
shall deliver a draft of such Tax Return to Seller for Sellers review and
approval at least fourteen (14) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return, (B) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and consult with each other in
order to finalize such Tax Return, and (C) thereafter Buyer shall cause such
Tax Return to be executed and duly and timely filed with the appropriate
Taxing Authority and shall, subject to _Section 6.14(b)_, pay all Taxes due
with respect to the period covered by such Tax Return.

 



31 (b) As between Seller and Buyer, Seller shall be responsible for and indemnify
Buyer against any Tax with respect to an Acquired Company that is
attributable to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or to that portion of a Straddle
Taxable Period that ends on the Closing Date, in each case to the extent that
such Tax exceeds the amount (if any) reflected as a current liability for
such Tax pursuant to the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
computation in accordance with _Section 2.6_. Within five (5) days prior to
the due date for the payment of any such Tax, if (i) the amount of such Tax
for which Seller is responsible, exceeds (ii) the amount reflected as a
current liability for such Tax in such Final Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such excess; if the
amount described in clause (ii) exceeds the amount described in clause (i),
Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess. With respect to a
Straddle Taxable Period, Seller shall determine the Tax attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Taxable Period that ends on the Closing Date by
an interim closing of the books of the relevant Acquired Company as of the
Closing Date, except for ad valorem or property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ")
and franchise Taxes based solely on capital which shall be prorated on a
daily basis to the Closing Date (such that the Property Taxes or franchise
Taxes attributable to the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Taxable Period
shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for such entire Straddle Taxable
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the Straddle Taxable Period that are in the Pre-Closing Taxable Period
and the denominator of which is the actual number of days in the Straddle
Taxable Period). For this purpose, any franchise Tax paid or payable not based
solely on capital with respect to such Acquired Company shall be allocated to
the taxable period for which the income, operations, Assets or capital
comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right
to do business for another period is obtained by the payment of such Tax.

 

(c) Buyer shall be responsible for and indemnify Seller and its applicable
Affiliates against, and Buyer shall be entitled to all refunds (including,
but not limited to, property tax refunds) and credits of, all Taxes of any
Acquired Company that are not the responsibility of Seller pursuant to
_Section 6.14(b)_.

 

(d) With respect to any Tax for which Seller is responsible, Seller shall have
the right, at its sole cost and expense, to initiate any claim for refund and
to control (in the case of a Pre-Closing Taxable Period) or participate in (in
the case of a Straddle Taxable Period) the prosecution, settlement or
compromise of any proceeding involving such Tax, including the determination
of the value of property for purposes of real and personal property ad
valorem Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that any such claim
or proceeding could reasonably be expected to have a post-Closing impact on
Buyer or on any of the Acquired Companies (a) Buyer shall be entitled to
participate in such proceeding and (b) Seller shall not initiate, settle or
otherwise compromise such proceeding without Buyers written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer shall (and shall
cause the relevant Acquired Company to) take such action in connection with
any such proceeding as Seller shall reasonably request from time to time to
implement the preceding sentence, including the selection of counsel and
experts and the execution of powers of attorney. Buyer shall (and shall cause
the relevant Acquired Company to) give written notice to Seller of its receipt
of any notice of any audit, examination, claim or assessment for any Tax for
which Seller is responsible within ten (10) days after its receipt of such
notice; failure to give any such written notice within such ten (10) day
period shall cause Buyer to forfeit any rights it may have by reason of 
_Section 4.10_ or this _Section 6.14_ to the extent Seller is actually
prejudiced by such failure.

(e) Seller shall grant to Buyer (or its designees) access at all reasonable
times to all of the information, books and records relating to the Acquired
Companies within the possession of

 



32  Seller (including workpapers and correspondence with Taxing Authorities),
and shall afford Buyer (or its designees) the right (at Buyers expense) to
take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Buyer (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, respond
to Tax audits and investigations, prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund
claims and to conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities. The previous
sentence shall, under no circumstances, be construed to grant Buyer access to
the consolidated United States federal income tax or any consolidated or
unitary state Tax Returns which include Seller or any of its Affiliates for
any taxable year. Buyer shall grant or cause the Acquired Companies to grant
to Seller (or its designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the
information, books and records relating to the Acquired Companies within the
possession of Buyer (including workpapers and correspondence with Taxing
Authorities) and to the employees of the Acquired Companies, and shall afford
Seller (or its designees) the right (at Sellers expense) to take extracts
therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to
permit Seller (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, respond to Tax audits
and investigations, prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund claims and to
conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities. After the Closing Date, Seller
and Buyer will preserve all information, records or documents in their
respective possessions relating to liabilities for Taxes of the Acquired
Companies until six (6) months after the expiration of any applicable statute
of limitations (including extensions thereof) with respect to the assessment
of such Taxes.

(f) If after the Closing Buyer or any Acquired Company actually receives a
refund of any Tax or utilizes a credit for any overpayment of any Tax of any
Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or that portion of a
Straddle Taxable Period ending on the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller
within ten (10) Business Days after such receipt or utilization an amount
equal to such refund received or credit utilized, together with any interest
received or credited thereon to the extent that such refund or credit
exceeds the amount (if any) reflected as a current asset for such refund or
credit pursuant to the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
computation in accordance with _Section 2.6_. Buyer shall, and shall cause
the relevant Acquired Company to, take such action to obtain a refund of any
Tax or a credit for any overpayment of any Tax of such Acquired Company for a
Pre-Closing Taxable Period or that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending
on the Closing Date or to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any such Tax that
could be imposed for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or that portion of a
Straddle Taxable Period ending on the Closing Date (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby) as is reasonably requested by Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation,
that Buyers obligation to cooperate with Sellers reasonable requests to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period shall
not be construed to require Buyer to carryback net operating losses or other
tax attributes that arise following the Closing to a Pre-Closing Taxable
Period or to take any other similar action that could have a negative impact
on Buyer.

(g) In the event that Seller initiates a claim for refund from a Taxing
Authority with regard to any Tax of any Acquired Company attributable to a
Pre-Closing Taxable Period or that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending
on the Closing Date, whether the initiation of such claim begins prior to or
after the Closing, Seller shall have all rights to and interest in such
refund. Buyer shall, upon request, provide Seller a limited power of attorney
allowing Seller to pursue such claim for refund with and collect such refund
from such Taxing Authority. If after the Closing Buyer or any
Acquired Company receives a refund or utilizes a credit of any such Tax with
regard to a claim so initiated by Seller, Buyer shall pay to Seller within ten
(10) Business Days after such receipt or utilization an amount equal to such
refund received or credit utilized, together with any interest received or
credited thereon, less any expenses Buyer has incurred as a result of such
action.

 

(h) In the event that Seller initiates a claim for refund from a third party
who improperly withheld sales and use Tax, or withheld excessive sales and
use Tax, with regard to an

 



33  Acquired Company attributable to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or that
portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending on the Closing Date, whether the
initiation of such claim begins prior to or after the Closing, Seller shall
have all rights to and interest in such refund. Buyer shall, upon request,
provide Seller a limited power of attorney allowing Seller to pursue such
claim for refund with and collect such refund from such third party. If after
the Closing, Buyer or an Acquired Company receives a refund of any such Tax
with regard to a claim so initiated by Seller, Buyer shall pay to Seller
within ten (10) Business Days after such receipt an amount equal to such
refund received, together with any interest received or credited thereon,
less any expenses Buyer has incurred as a result of such action.

(i) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written
certificate, prepared and executed in accordance with the requirements of
Treasury Regulation section 1.1445-2(b), certifying that Seller (or owner of
Seller if Seller is a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes) is
not a foreign person within the meaning of said Treasury Regulation.

(j) The Parties acknowledge that, since (i) the Acquired Companies, other
than FPLE Forney and Lamar, are classified as disregarded from their owners
for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) an election pursuant to Section
338(h)(10) of the Code shall be made with respect to the purchase and sale of
the membership interests of FPLE Forney and Lamar (from a federal income tax
perspective), the purchase and sale of the Interests is intended to be treated
for federal income tax purposes as a purchase and sale of the Assets and
liabilities of the Acquired Companies. Buyer, Seller, and their Affiliates
shall (a) cooperate in the preparation and filing of (and shall properly
execute and file) elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect
to the sale of the membership interests in each of FPLE Forney and Lamar (from
a federal income tax perspective), and (b) take all such actions as are
required in order to give effect to those elections for state and local Tax
purposes to the greatest extent permitted by law. Neither Buyer, the Acquired
Companies, nor any of their Affiliates shall make any election under Section
338(g) of the Code with respect to the sale of the membership interests in
each of FPLE Forney and Lamar (from a federal income tax perspective).

_Section 6.15 Appointment of Primary Representatives_. In order to
facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each Party shall designate a primary Representative (each, a "
_Primary Representative_ ") to act as the primary point of contact
to coordinate communications and other interaction between the Parties during
the Interim Period. Either Party may designate a new Primary Representative by
providing written notice to the other Party.

 

 _Section 6.16 Updating; Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in
writing of (a) the existence or occurrence, or failure to occur, of any fact
or event of which it has knowledge that would be reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at any time from the Effective Date to the
Closing assuming such representation or warranty is made at such time, (b)
the failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant to be complied with by it hereunder, (c) any written notice or
other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent or
approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (d) any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Seller may provide to Buyer changes or additions to any of the Schedules
(a " _Schedule Supplement_ ") solely to correct any matter that would
otherwise constitute a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
of Seller in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ such that the closing condition
in _Section 7.1_ cannot be satisfied. A Schedule Supplement shall only
disclose facts or events

 



34  that first occurred or arose after the Effective Date. No such Schedule
Supplement shall be deemed to cure any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of _Section
7.1_ or otherwise alter the Parties rights under _Section 9.1(b)_ unless
Buyer specifically agrees thereto in writing; provided, however, that if the
Closing shall occur despite the fact that Seller had provided Buyer, as
contemplated above, a Schedule Supplement such that the closing condition in
_Section 7.1_ could not be satisfied, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement (including _Article X_ ) no matters disclosed by
Seller prior to the Closing in the Schedule Supplement that constituted
breaches of, or inaccuracies in, one or more representations or warranties of
Seller in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ as of the Effective Date or as of the
Closing Date shall be the basis for any indemnification by Seller pursuant to
_Section 10.1(a)_.

_Section 6.17 Announcements_. No press release or other public announcement,
or public statement or comment in response to any inquiry, relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by
either Buyer or Seller, or any of their Affiliates or Representatives,
without the consent of Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided, however_ ,
that a press release or other public announcement, regulatory filing,
statement or comment made without such consent, including in furtherance of
the requirements of _Section 6.1_, shall not be in violation of this _Section
6.17_ if it is made in order to comply with applicable Laws or stock exchange
rules and in the reasonable judgment of the Party or Affiliate making such
release or announcement, based upon advice of counsel, prior review and joint
approval, despite reasonable efforts to obtain the same, would prevent
dissemination of such release or announcement in a sufficiently timely fashion
to comply with such applicable Laws or rules; _provided, further_ , that in
all instances Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall provide
prompt notice of any such release, announcement, statement or comment to the
other Party.

_Section 6.18 Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each Party shall (at its own cost and expense) at any time and
from time to time, upon reasonable request, (a) do, execute, acknowledge and
deliver, and cause to be done, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such
further acts, transfers or assignments as may be required to consummate the
transactions in accordance with the terms hereof and to cause to be fulfilled
the closing conditions set forth in _Article VII_ and  _Article VIII_ and
(b) take such other actions as may be reasonably required in order to carry
out the intent of this Agreement; provided that in no event shall any Party be
required to take any action which (i) increases in any way the liability or
obligations of such Party, (ii) in the opinion of its counsel, is unlawful or
would or could constitute a violation of any applicable Law or require the
approval of any Governmental Authority (other than a Buyer Approval, a Seller
Approvals or a Company Consent) or (iii) could reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impede, interfere with or delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 _Section 6.19 Reserved_.

 

 _Section 6.20 Qualified Scheduling Entity_. Buyer acknowledges that the
Affiliate of Seller that serves as the Qualified Scheduling Entity with
respect to the Projects is not one of the Acquired Companies and upon the
occurrence of the Closing such Affiliate will continue to act as the Qualified
Scheduling Entity with respect to the Projects, and that Buyer and
the Acquired Companies shall be responsible for appointing and maintaining a
Qualified Scheduling Entity with respect to the Projects after the Closing.

 

 _Section 6.21 Exclusivity_.

 

(a) Seller agrees that during the Interim Period, Seller shall not, and shall
take all action necessary to ensure that none of the Acquired Companies or
any of their respective Affiliates or

 



35  Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or accept
any other proposals or offers from any Person (A) relating to any direct
acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the equity or ownership
interest of any of the Acquired Companies or Purchased Assets other than
inventory to be sold in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (B) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other business
combination with any of the Acquired Companies or (C) to enter into a
recapitalization, reorganization or any other extraordinary business
transaction directly involving any of the Acquired Companies; or

 

(b) Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing; provided,
however, the foregoing shall not be required Seller to direct or otherwise
cause any such Person to return or destroy information heretofore provided to
such Person prior to the Closing.

_Section 6.22 Additional Assets Contribution_. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall cause its applicable Affiliates to contribute to one or more of the
Acquired Companies good and valid title free and clear of all Encumbrances to
each of the Additional Assets.

 

 _Section 6.23 Forney Rotor_. Promptly following the Closing, Seller will
make available for purchase by Buyer, under mutually agreeable terms and
conditions, the compressor section of an upgraded combustion turbine rotor (a
" _Compressor Section_ "). If Buyer purchases a Compressor Section from
Seller, Seller will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to procure the
turbine section of an upgraded combustion turbine rotor (a " _Turbine Section_
") for Buyer under mutually agreeable terms and conditions, which terms and
conditions the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith prior to the Closing.
If Seller is unable to procure a Turbine Section, or the Parties are unable to
agree on terms and conditions for the purchase and sale of a Turbine Section,
then Seller will make its Affiliates spare rotor available for purchase to
Buyer under mutually agreeable terms and conditions no earlier than January 1,
2017.

_Section 6.24 Gas Supply Agreement_. Promptly following the Effective Date,
Seller and Buyer shall endeavor to negotiate in good faith a mutually
agreeable gas supply agreement between NextEra Energy Power Marketing, LLC and
FPLE Forney, LLC and a completion payment by Buyer or the Acquired Companies
to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller with respect to the pipeline project to be
constructed and owned in part by an Affiliate of Seller and connecting with
the KM Facilities, with the amount of such payment and the terms and
conditions upon which it would be made to be set forth in such gas supply
agreement.

TERMINATION

 

 _Section 9.1 Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, as follows:

(a) at any time before the Closing, (i) by Seller or Buyer, by written notice
to the other, in the event that any Law or Order restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the sale of the Interests pursuant to
this Agreement or (ii) by Buyer, by written notice to Seller, if a
Governmental Authority seeks to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
or make illegal the sale of the Interests pursuant to this Agreement;

(b) at any time before the Closing, by Seller or Buyer, by written notice to
the other, if the other has breached its obligations or there is an inaccuracy
in its representations and warranties hereunder, where the effect of such
breach or inaccuracy would be to cause the conditions to the obligation to
consummate the Closing of the terminating Party not to be capable of being
satisfied (assuming the Closing were otherwise to occur on the date the
terminating Party delivers notice of termination), and such breach or
inaccuracy (other than a breach of Buyers obligation to pay the Purchase
Price in accordance with the terms of _Article II_ ), if capable of being
cured, has not been cured within forty-five (45) days following written
notification thereof; _provided, however_ , that if, at the end of such
forty-five (45) day period, the breaching Party is endeavoring in good faith,
and proceeding diligently, to cure such breach or inaccuracy, the breaching
Party shall have an additional thirty (30) days in which to effect such cure;

(c) at any time before the Closing, by Buyer or Seller, by written notice to
the other, on or after the date that is two hundred seventy (270) days after
the Effective Date, as the same

 



38  may be extended pursuant to _Section 6.11_ (the " _Initial Outside Date_
"); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this 
_Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be available to a Party if such Party is in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that, subject to 
_Section 9.5_, if on the Initial Outside Date, the conditions set forth in
either _Section 7.5_ or _Section 8.5_ are not satisfied but all of the other
conditions to Closing are satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and the conditions set forth
in either _Section 7.5_ or _Section 8.5_, as the case may be, remain capable
of being satisfied, then Buyer may, at its option exercisable by delivering
written notice to Seller before the Initial Outside Date, extend the Initial
Outside Date until the date that is 90 days after the Initial Outside Date
(such date as it may be extended (the " _Outside Date_ "));

 

(d) at any time before the Closing, by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, if
all of the conditions to close set forth in  _Article VII_ and _Article
VIII_ have been satisfied (other than such closing conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing which are then capable of being
satisfied) or waived in writing by the applicable Party and Buyer fails to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby at the Closing;

(e) by Buyer or Seller to the extent contemplated by  _Section 6.11_ or
_Section 6.12_, by notice to the other Party in accordance with such
Sections; or

(f) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller.

_Section 9.2 Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, except as set forth in _Section 9.3_
and _Section 9.4_, there will be no liability or obligation on the part of
Seller or Buyer (or any of their respective Representatives or Affiliates), 
_provided_ that (a) _Section 6.2(c)_ , _Section 6.7(b)_, _Section 6.17_,
_Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_, _Section 10.4_, _Section 10.6_, _Section
10.8_,  _Section 11.1_ and _Article XII_ (to the extent applicable to such
surviving sections) will survive any such termination and (b) each Party shall
continue to be liable for any willful and intentional material breach of
this Agreement by it occurring prior to such termination. For purposes of
this _Section 9.2_, "willful and intentional material breach" shall mean a
material breach or material default that is a consequence of an act
knowingly undertaken by the breaching Party with the intent of causing a
material breach of this Agreement.

_Section 9.3 Break-up Fee_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Seller pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(d)_ or (ii) by Seller or Buyer if all of the
conditions to Closing, other than the conditions in _Section 8.6(b)_, have
been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date and this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(f)_
as a result of Buyer failing to satisfy the conditions in _Section 8.6(b)_,
then, in any such case, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement Buyer shall pay Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within three (3) Business Days following the date of termination, as
liquidated damages, an amount of $131,303,723 (the " _Break-up Fee_ ").

 

(b) As security for Buyers obligations pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_,
_Section 9.4(b)_ or _Section 9.4(c)_, on the Effective Date, Buyer has
provided the Break-up Fee Security in the amount equal to $131,303,723. If
Buyer shall fail to pay to Seller when due the full amount of the Break-up
Fee, Seller shall be entitled to draw from the Break-up Fee Security the
unpaid portion of the Break-up Fee. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Buyer the Break-up Fee Security for cancellation.

 



39 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that Buyer is required to pay the Break-up Fee pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_
and Buyer pays the full Break-up Fee, payment of such fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Seller and its Affiliates against Buyer and any of its
former, current and future Affiliates, representatives, shareholders,
members, managers, partners, successors and assigns for any losses, damages or
liabilities suffered or incurred as a result of or under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including the failure of the Closing to occur, and Buyer shall have
no further liability or obligation to Seller or its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation
made or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith or therewith,
whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and in such
event, Seller shall not bring or permit any of its Affiliates to bring any
action, suit or other proceeding to seek to recover any money damages or
obtain any equitable relief from Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection
therewith.

 

(d) The provision for payment of liquidated damages in this _Section 9.3_ has
been included because, in the event of the termination of this Agreement as
described in _Section 9.3(a)_, the actual damages to be incurred by Seller
can reasonably be expected to approximate the Break-up Fee and because the
actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure
accurately. The Parties further expressly acknowledge and agree that the
liquidated damages in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are intended not as a penalty,
but as full liquidated damages, in the event of Sellers termination of this
Agreement in the manner contemplated in _Section 9.3(a)_ and as compensation
for all of Sellers losses and other expenses associated with this Agreement.
In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event Buyer shall
fail to pay the Break-up Fee specified in this _Section 9.3_ when due, and
Seller (or Buyer) commences a proceeding which results in a judgment or
similar award against Buyer for the Break-up Fee, then Buyer shall also pay
to Seller its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses of enforcement) in connection with such proceeding.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, but subject to _Section 10.8(a)_, in no event shall (i) Buyers
aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether
relating to breach of a representation or warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation in this Agreement and whether based in tort, contract,
strict liability or other Laws or otherwise, exceed the amount of the Break-
up Fee or (ii) Seller be entitled to collect both the Break-up Fee and the
Regulatory Break-up Fee.

 

 _Section 9.4 Regulatory Break-up Fee_.

 

(a) If (i) either Buyer or Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_ (if, and only if, the applicable Order giving rise to such
termination arises solely in connection with the Seller Approvals from a
Governmental Authority set forth as #1 on _Schedule 3.3_ , and Buyer Approvals
from a Governmental Authority set forth as #1 and #2 on _Schedule 5.3_
(collectively, the " _Regulatory Approvals_ "), or (ii) either Buyer or Seller
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ and, at the time of
such termination, any of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.4_,
_Section 7.5_, _Section 8.4_ or _Section 8.5_ or shall have not been
satisfied and such failure to be satisfied arises solely in connection with
the Regulatory Approvals, and, at the time of such termination, all other
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ shall
have been satisfied or waived or are capable of being satisfied, Buyer shall
pay to Seller a fee of $98,477,792 (the " _Regulatory Break-up Fee_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 9.4(a)_, in the case of the termination of this
Agreement as described in clause (i) or (ii) of _Section 9.4(a)_, the amount
of the Regulatory Break-up Fee shall be $131,303,723 if the applicable Order
includes Burdensome Conditions requiring, or the 

 



40  Governmental Authority shall have required Burdensome Conditions as a
condition to the granting of the applicable Regulatory Approval, the taking by
Buyer or its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies of such efforts or action,
individually or in the aggregate, that would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to a company
the size of the Company), without giving effect to the exclusions set forth
in clauses (g) or (h) of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect".

(c) If Buyer shall fail to pay to Seller when due the full amount of the
Regulatory Break-up Fee, Seller shall be entitled to draw from the Break-up
Fee Security the unpaid portion of the Regulatory Break-up Fee.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that Buyer is required to pay the Regulatory Break-up Fee pursuant to
_Section 9.4(a)_ or _Section 9.4(b)_ and Buyer pays the full Regulatory
Break-up Fee, payment of such fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller and its Affiliates against Buyer and any of its former, current and
future Affiliates, representatives, shareholders, members, managers, partners,
successors and assigns for any losses, damages or liabilities suffered or
incurred as a result of or under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including
the failure of the Closing to occur, and Buyer shall have no further liability
or obligation to Seller or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to
be have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and in such event, Seller shall not
bring or permit any of its Affiliates to bring any action, suit or other
proceeding to seek to recover any money damages or obtain any equitable relief
from Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection therewith.

 

(e) The provision for payment of liquidated damages in this _Section 9.4_ has
been included because, in the event of the termination of this Agreement as
described in _Section 9.4_, the actual damages to be incurred by Seller can
reasonably be expected to approximate the Regulatory Break-up Fee and because
the actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to
measure accurately. The Parties further expressly acknowledge and agree that
the liquidated damages in this _Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are intended not as
a penalty, but as full liquidated damages, in the event of Sellers
termination of this Agreement in the manner contemplated in _Section 9.4(a)_
and _Section 9.4(b)_ and as compensation for all of Sellers losses
and other expenses associated with this Agreement. In addition, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that, in the event Buyer shall fail to pay the
Regulatory Break-up Fee specified in _Section 9.4(a)_ or _Section 9.4(b)_
when due, and Seller (or Buyer) commences a proceeding which results in a
judgment or similar award against Buyer for the Regulatory Break-up Fee, then
Buyer shall also pay to Seller its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in connection with
such proceeding.

 



41 _Section 9.5 Extension of Break-up Fee Security_. As a condition to
Buyers ability to exercise its right to extend the Initial Outside Date
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_, the termination date of the Break-up Fee
Security must be no earlier than three months following the Outside Date.

covenant, agreement or obligation in this Agreement and whether based on
contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise, exceed
$1,313,037,228.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a written claim or written notice is

(a) Each Party shall give written notice to the other Party as soon as
practicable after becoming aware of any breach by such other Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation in this Agreement.

policies available and existing on the Closing Date that provide coverage with

indemnify or pay the Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.1_ with respect to such Losses (a " _Third Party Payment_ " and, together
with an Insurance Payment, a " _Mitigation Payment_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the recovery by a Person entitled
to indemnification pursuant to  _Section 10.1_ from any Party providing such
indemnification shall not relieve the Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 10.1_ of its obligation to mitigate Losses pursuant to
applicable Law or this  _Section 10.4(b)_.

(c) Any amounts payable to a Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.1_ with respect to any Losses pursuant to this _Article X_ shall

amount so paid by the Party providing such indemnification.

 

(d) Any amounts payable to a Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.1_ with respect to any Losses pursuant to this _Article X_ shall

 _Section 10.5 Indirect Claims_. From and after the Closing, Buyer hereby
releases and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and
the officers, directors, managers, agents and employees of the Acquired
Companies (acting in their capacity as such) from and against any Losses for
controlling stockholder liability or breach of any fiduciary or other duty
relating to any pre-Closing actions or failures to act (including negligence
or gross negligence but excluding Fraud) in connection with the Acquired
Companies or any of them and the business of the Acquired Companies or any of
them prior to the Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not relieve
Seller of its indemnity obligations under _Section 10.1(a)_.

 _Section 10.8 Remedies; Waiver of Remedies_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that damages at Law shall be an inadequate remedy for
the breach of any of the covenants, promises and agreements contained in this
Agreement by Buyer or Seller, and, accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled
to injunctive relief with respect to any such breach, including specific
performance of such covenants, promises or agreements or an order enjoining
such other party from any threatened, or from the continuation of any actual,
breach of the covenants, promises or agreements contained in this Agreement,
all without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy and without the necessity of posting bond. The rights set forth in
this _Section 10.8(a)_ shall be in addition to any other rights which the
Parties may have at Law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no case shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be entitled
to both injunctive relief and the Break-up Fee or the Regulatory Break-up Fee.
Except for specific performance or other injunctive or equitable relief to the
extent that specific performance or such other relief would otherwise be
available to the Parties hereunder, Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree
that, from and after Closing, the indemnification provisions in this _Article
X_ , _Section 6.2(c)_, _Section 6.2(d)_,  _Section 6.5(b)_, _Section
6.6_, _Section 6.14(b)_, _Section 6.14(c)_ and _Section 2.6_ shall be the

OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE OTHER PARTYS OR ITS
AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR
REPRESENTATIVES SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT, AND IN PARTICULAR, NO "MULTIPLE OF PROFITS" OR "MULTIPLE OF CASH
FLOW" OR SIMILAR VALUATION METHODOLOGY SHALL BE USED IN CALCULATING THE

CLAIMS FOR WHICH ANY PARTY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY ANOTHER PARTY HEREUNDER
(" _Non-Reimbursable Damages_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Representative or Affiliate of Seller (other than NEER pursuant to the Seller
Parent Guaranty) shall have any personal liability (whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) to Buyer or any other Person as a
result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation of Seller in this Agreement, and no Representative or Affiliate of
Buyer (other than Buyer Parent Guarantor pursuant to the Buyer Parent
Guaranty) shall have any personal liability (whether in equity or at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) to Seller or any other Person as a result of
the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
of Buyer in this Agreement.

 

 _Section 10.9 Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that (i) a Party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") becomes aware of the existence of any claim in respect of which
payment may be sought under this _Article X_ (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
or (ii) any legal proceedings shall be instituted, or any claim shall be
asserted, by any Person not party to this Agreement in respect of an
Indemnification Claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall
promptly cause written notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to be delivered
to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_
"); provided that, so long as such notice is given within the applicable time
period described in _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.2(a)(ii)_, no delay
on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such notice shall relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder unless (and
then solely to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such delay. Each Claim Notice shall be in writing and (A) shall
specify the basis for indemnification claimed by the Indemnified Party, (B) if
such Claim Notice is being given with respect to a Third Party Claim, shall
describe in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and shall be accompanied
by copies of all relevant pleadings, demands and other papers served on the
Indemnified Party, and (C) shall specify the amount of (or if not finally
determined, a good faith estimate of) the Losses being incurred by, or
imposed upon, the Indemnified Party on account of the basis for the claim for
indemnification.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and
expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise handle any Indemnification Claim and if the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
handle any Indemnification Claim, it shall within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of notice of

 



47  the underlying Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the
Indemnification Claim so requires) (the " _Dispute Period_ ") notify the
Indemnified Party of its intent to do so, _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if
(i) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal or quasi criminal action or proceeding or (ii) the claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
(any Indemnification Claim the defense of which is assumable by an
Indemnifying Party hereunder, an " _Assumable Claim_ "). If the Indemnifying
Party does not elect within the Dispute Period to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise handle any Assumable Claim, the Indemnified Party may
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise handle such Assumable Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle with or
otherwise handle any Assumable Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate,
at its own expense, in the defense of such Assumable Claim; _provided,
however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any
such defense with separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the
Indemnifying Party if (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to
participate, or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified
Party, a conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party; and _provided, further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Assumable Claim. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, agree to cooperate with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Assumable Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.9_ to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the applicable
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Assumable Claim or permit a
default or consent to entry of any judgment (each a " _Settlement_ ") unless
(A) the claimant and such Indemnifying Party provide to such Indemnified
Party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the Assumable
Claim, (B) such Settlement does not impose any liabilities or obligations on
the Indemnified Party, and (C) with respect to any non-monetary provision of
such Settlement, such provisions would not, in the Indemnified Partys
reasonable judgment, have or be reasonably expected to have any material
adverse effect on the business, Assets, condition (financial or otherwise),
results of operations or prospects of the Indemnified Party.

(c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, or a Settlement or arbitration shall have
been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to an
Indemnification Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying
Party shall make prompt payment thereof pursuant to the terms of the agreement
reached with respect to the Indemnification Claim.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake within the Dispute Period to
defend against an Assumable Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in any such defense at its sole cost and expense, but, in
such case, the Indemnified Party shall control the investigation and defense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this _Section 10.9(d)_ to the
contrary, the Indemnified Party shall not effect a Settlement without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(e) In the event that an Indemnified Party has delivered a Claim Notice in
respect of an Indemnification Claim that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any disputes with respect to such Claim Notice within forty-
five (45) days of the delivery by the Indemnifying Party thereof, and if
not resolved in such forty-five (45) day period, such Indemnification Claim
may be resolved through judicial actions, suits or proceedings brought by
either such party or by such other means as such parties mutually agree.

 



48 _Section 10.10 Access to Information_. After the Closing Date, Seller and
Buyer shall grant each other (or their respective designees), and Buyer shall
cause the Acquired Companies to grant to Seller (or its designees), access at
all reasonable times upon reasonable notice to all of the information, books
and records relating to the Acquired Companies in its possession, and shall
afford such party the right (at such partys expense) to take extracts
therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to
implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend any claims between
the Parties arising under, this Agreement other than (a) information relating
to post-Closing periods that is commercially sensitive, trade secret or
otherwise confidential or (b) in the case of claims between the Parties, any
information that is subject to any attorney-client, work product or other
privilege or that otherwise would not be required to be provided pursuant to a
subpoena or other civil discovery procedure. At or promptly after the
Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer all books, records, correspondence,
files, and other information of or relating to the Acquired Companies or their
properties, business, operations or condition (other than any of the foregoing
items that relate to Excluded Contracts and Excluded Items) to the extent
such information is not in the custody or possession of the Acquired Companies
on the Closing Date other than (i) information relating to pre-Closing periods
in respect of any Non-Acquired Company Affiliate that is commercially
sensitive, trade secret or otherwise confidential or (ii) in the case of
claims between the Parties, any information that is subject to any attorney
client, work product or other privilege or that otherwise would not be
required to be provided pursuant to a subpoena or other civil discovery
procedure.

Agreement shall terminate on the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, the

proprietary to Seller and Buyer agrees from and after the Closing not to,
directly or indirectly, use, publish, disseminate, describe or otherwise
disclose any Seller Confidential Information without the prior written consent
of Seller or except as required by Law. Information shall not be deemed to be
Seller Confidential Information if (i) it has become generally known or
available within the industry or the public though no act or omission of
Buyer; (ii) Buyer can demonstrate that, prior to disclosure in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, such information was already in
the possession of Buyer; (iii) it was received by Buyer from a third party who
became aware of it through no act or omission of Buyer and who is not known to
Buyer to be under an obligation of confidentiality to Seller; or (iv) Buyer

Buyer.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall maintain any Seller Confidential
Information which has been or will be disclosed directly or indirectly to
Buyer by or on behalf of Seller in confidence by it and shall not disclose or
cause to be disclosed by Buyer or any third party without Sellers prior
express written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, however_ , that Buyer may
disclose Seller Confidential Information to persons who provide financial
analysis, financial ratings, banking, legal, accounting, or other services to

of Buyer or except as required by Law. Information shall not be deemed to be

within the industry or the public though no act or omission of Seller.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall maintain any Buyer Confidential
Information which has been or will be disclosed directly or indirectly to
Seller by or on behalf of Buyer in confidence by it and shall not disclose or
cause to be disclosed by Seller or any third party without Buyers prior
express written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, however_ , that Seller may
disclose Buyer Confidential Information to persons who provide financial
analysis, financial ratings, banking, legal, accounting, or other services to
Seller in connection with the implementation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that such persons have been informed
of the duties required hereby.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions
of this _Section 11.3_ shall not prohibit the disclosure of Buyer
Confidential Information by Seller to the extent reasonably required (i) to
prepare or complete any required Tax returns or financial statements, (ii) in
connection with audits or other proceedings by or on behalf of a Governmental
Authority, (iii) to comply with applicable Law, (iv) to provide services to
Buyer or its Affiliates, pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, or (v) to assert any rights or remedies or perform any
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents.

_Section 11.4 Limitations on Confidential Information_.

(a) Notwithstanding _Section 11.2(b)_ and _Section 11.3(b)_, from and after
the Closing, Seller Confidential Information and Buyer Confidential
Information may be disclosed if required by any Governmental Authority or
court or otherwise by Law; _provided, however_ , that: (i) such Seller
Confidential Information and Buyer Confidential Information is submitted
under any and all applicable provisions for confidential treatment and (ii) if
the disclosing Party is permitted to do so, the other Party is given written
notice of the requirement for disclosure promptly after such disclosure is
requested, so that it may take whatever action it deems appropriate, including
intervention in any proceeding and seeking a protective order or an
injunction, to prohibit such disclosure. If Seller Confidential Information or
Buyer Confidential Information is disclosed under the provisions of this
_Section 11.4(a)_, the disclosing Party shall notify the other Party of the
same in writing not later than five (5) Business Days following the
disclosure.

 

(b) Each Party hereby agrees that from and after the Closing it will not make
any use of any Seller Confidential Information or Buyer Confidential
Information, as applicable, received pursuant to this Agreement, except in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, unless specifically authorized to do so in writing by
the other Party, and this Agreement shall not be construed as a license or
authorization to either Party to utilize Seller Confidential Information or
Buyer Confidential Information, as applicable, except for such purpose.

 



50 (c) From and after the Closing, upon a Partys request, the other Party shall
return or destroy as promptly as practicable, but in a period not to exceed
ten (10) Business Days, (i) all Seller Confidential Information or Buyer
Confidential Information (as applicable) provided to such Party, as
appropriate, including all copies of such Seller Confidential Information, or
Buyer Confidential Information (as applicable) and (ii) all notes or other
documents in digital or other format in their possession or in the possession
of other persons to whom Seller Confidential Information or Buyer
Confidential Information (as applicable) was properly provided by such Party.
Non-destruction of electronic copies of materials or summaries containing or
reflecting Seller Confidential Information or Buyer Confidential Information
(as applicable) that are automatically generated through data backup or
archiving systems and which are not readily accessible by a Partys business
personnel shall not be deemed to violate this Agreement, so long as Seller
Confidential Information or Buyer Confidential Information (as applicable)
contained in or reflected in such electronic backup records is not disclosed
or used in violation of the other terms of this Agreement.

 

(d) The obligations of the parties under _Section 11.2(b)_ and _Section
11.3(c)_ shall not apply to the tax treatment or tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party (and any employee,
Representative, or agent of any party) may disclose to any and all Persons,
without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all other materials of any
kind (including opinions or other tax analysis) that are provided to a Party
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure (all such information that
may be disclosed being the " _Tax Information_ "). The preceding sentences
are intended to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be treated as having been offered under conditions of confidentiality for
purposes of Sections 1.6011-4(b)(3) and 301.6111-2(a)(2)(ii) (or any
successor provision) of the Treasury Regulations issued under the Code and
shall be construed in a manner consistent with such purpose. For purposes of
this provision, the Tax Information includes only those facts that may be
relevant to understanding the purported or claimed United States federal
income tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to eliminate any doubt, therefore specifically does not
include information that either reveals or standing alone or in the aggregate
with other information so disclosed tends of itself to reveal or allow the
recipient of the information to ascertain the identity of Seller or Buyer, or
any third parties involved in any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

 _Section 12.4 Schedules_. Seller may, at its option, include in the
Schedules items that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding,
and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be
deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that such items are material,
to

 



52  establish any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of
such terms for purposes of this Agreement. Any reference to a Contract, Asset,
statement, plan, report or other document or item of any kind in the
Schedules shall be deemed a full disclosure of all of the terms of such
document and it shall not be necessary to identify or reference specific

other documents or items in order to make a full disclosure thereof.
Information disclosed in any Schedule shall constitute a disclosure for

other Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face. In no event shall the
inclusion of any matter in the Schedules be construed as constituting a
representation or warranty of a Party or be deemed or interpreted to broaden a

indication or evidence that such item or other matter is material, that such
item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or that such
item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Schedules. No reference in the Schedules to any agreement or document shall
be construed as an admission or indication that such agreement or document is
enforceable or currently in effect or that there are any obligations remaining
to be performed or any rights that may be exercised under such agreement or
document except to the extent that any such agreement or document is referred
to by reference to the Schedules in an express representation or warranty to
that effect set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in the Schedules
relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, Law or
regulation shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The headings
and descriptions of the disclosures in the Schedules are for convenience of
reference only and are not intended to and do not alter the meaning of any
provision of this Agreement or of the Schedules. The information provided in
the Schedules is solely for the use of the Parties in connection with the
purchase and sale of the Interests and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, shall be subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and may not be used or relied upon by any other
Person or for any other purpose.

_Section 12.5 Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived
at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition.
No waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one
or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same
or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

_Article X_ , which are intended to be for the benefit of the Persons
identified therein, the terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended
solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors or
permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-
party beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

 

 _Section 12.8 Assignment or Delegation; Binding Effect_. Neither this
Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party,
except that Buyer may (without the consent of Seller) collaterally assign this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any
Person providing financing to Buyer or its Affiliates, but no such collateral
assignment shall release Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement.
Subject to this _Section 12.8_, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to
the benefit of and is enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 



53 _Section 12.9 Headings_. The headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the
provisions hereof.

_Section 12.10 Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law,
and if the rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision will be fully
severable, this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect
and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or
by its severance herefrom and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

 

 _Section 12.11 Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all
of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile
or electronically transmitted copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all

State of New York with respect to any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED
HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF
DEALING OR STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) RELATING TO THE
FOREGOING (INCLUDING, ANY ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY
CLAIMS OR DEFENSES ASSERTING THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED OR

Notes:



   (a) | Represents excess cash available to fund future operating needs
or required principal and interest payments. Such excess cash is typically
swept to parent and replaced with a cash management guarantee. There will be
no amounts outstanding under the cash management guarantee at closing, as any
amounts previously drawn on the guarantee shall be returned in cash prior to
closing. For the avoidance of doubt, any such cash management guarantee or
other guarantee shall not be deemed "cash and cash equivalents" for any such
accounts and the applicable amounts in such accounts shall only be deemed
"cash and cash equivalents" for the calculation of "Current Assets" if
deposited in cash prior to the closing. 
---|--- 
   (b) | Represents cash available in the Bank of America operating
account (net of any outstanding checks) to cover next months estimated OandM
cash disbursements. This account is funded on a monthly basis from
cash available in the Project Revenues Collection Account. 
---|--- 
   (c) | Represents cash that may be transferred to the Project Revenues
Collection Account at any time. 
---|--- 
   (d) | Represents estimated cash required to fund the next 12 months of
Major Maintenance Expenditures, as defined in the Credit Agreement. This
account is replenished on a quarterly basis, and any cash not required to pay
for next months major maintenance expenditures is typically swept to parent
and replaced with a major maintenance reserve guarantee. There will be no
amounts outstanding under the major maintenance reserve guarantee at closing,
as any amounts previously drawn on the guarantee shall be returned in cash
prior to closing. 
---|--- 
   (e) | Represents cash required to cover the next two estimated
quarterly minimum principal and interest payments as of each Debt Service and
Reserve Funding Date, as defined in the Credit Agreement. This amount is
adjusted on a quarterly basis with funds transferred to or from the Project
Revenues Collection Account and is in the form of a debt service reserve
guarantee. There will be no amounts outstanding under the debt service reserve
guarantee at closing, as the Debt Service Reserve Account will be funded with
cash prior to closing. 
---|--- 
   (f) | Primarily represents estimated receivables for monthly
settlements due from hedge counterparty and daily energy settlements due from
ERCOT that will be collected in the following month. 
---|--- 
   (g) | Primarily consists of amounts due from NextEra Energy Power
Marketing, LLC ("NEPM") for monthly energy sales based on the day-ahead index
pricing. Such sales and receivables are not forecasted, but any
actual amounts will be assumed to be collected upon closing and excluded from
working capital (removed from Buyers opening trial balance). 
---|--- 
   (h) | Consists of all spare parts included on Exhibit K. 
---|--- 
   (i) | Property and casualty insurance premiums are paid by parent and
allocated down to the various benefitted entities, including La Frontera.
These insurance policies are non-transferable, so any related prepaid amounts
do not benefit the Buyer and have been excluded from working capital (removed
from Buyers opening trial balance). 
---|--- 
 



C-3 paid annually in connection with the financing. 
---|--- 
   (k) | Derivative and income tax assets and liabilities are excluded
from working capital (removed from Buyers opening trial balance). 
---|--- 
   (l) | This amount is intended to cover all third party trade payables,
including accrued expenses for any invoices received on or after the closing
date for costs incurred prior to the closing date (excluding other
current liabilities specifically identified herein). 
---|--- 
   (m) | Primarily consists of amounts due to 1) NEPM for estimated fuel
purchases for the current month and 2) other related parties for estimated
payroll and other operating costs for the current month, including
accrued payroll taxes and incentives for 2015. Amount is assumed to be paid
to related parties upon closing and excluded from working capital (removed
from Buyers opening trial balance). 
---|--- 
   (n) | Consists of the estimated property tax assessments for the 2015
calendar year that are paid in arrears (tax bills due in January 2016). 
---|--- 
   (o) | Consists of estimated 2015 audit fees in connection with
financing requirement. Parent will pay all such audit fees directly on behalf
of La Frontera, so this amount has been excluded from working capital (removed
from Buyers opening trial balance). 
---|--- 
   (p) | Consists of interest on the outstanding principal balance of the
debt for 1 day (12/31/15) that is not included in the minimum principal and
interest payment scheduled to be made on 12/31/15. Daily interest in the same
amount will continue to be accrued after 12/31/15 until closing on or before
3/31/16. 
---|--- 
   (q) | All outstanding principal balances associated with long-term debt
obligations are excluded from working capital. 
---|--- 
   (r) | Consists of Adjustments to balance sheet to provide a normalized
amount of working capital based on LTM average amounts plus growth based on
financial projections provided. For the avoidance of doubt the
$34,000,000 normalization Adjustment to Net Working Capital in Table I is
included Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount only, and will not be
added to Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount or the Final Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount.
