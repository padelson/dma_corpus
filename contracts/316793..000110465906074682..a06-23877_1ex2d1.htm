ARTICLE I 
 SALE OF SHARES AND ACQUIRED ASSETS AND CLOSING

  

1.1. _Purchase and Sale_. Seller will sell and cause to be sold to
the applicable PCS Purchasers, and Purchaser will purchase and cause to
be purchased from Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries, all of the right,
title and interest of Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries in and to the
Shares and the Acquired Assets at the Closing on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreements and this Agreement.

  

1.2. _Purchase Price_. As set forth in the Purchase Agreements, and subject
to adjustment as set forth in Section 1.4 hereof, the aggregate purchase
price for the Shares and the Acquired Assets is Two Hundred and Eighty-Nine
Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($289,700,000) (the " _Purchase Price_
"), payable in immediately available United States funds at the Closing in
the manner provided and in such amounts and pursuant to such instructions as
are set forth in the Purchase Agreements and allocated among the Shares and
the Acquired Assets as set forth in _Schedule 1.2_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the purchase price set forth in each of the Purchase Agreements shall
be inclusive, and not exclusive, of or additive to the Purchase Price
referred to above.

  

1.3. _Escrow_. On the Closing Date, a portion of the Purchase Price otherwise
payable to Seller pursuant to Section 1.2 equal to $14,485,000 (the "
_Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") will be paid by Purchaser to an escrow
fund established pursuant to the terms of an indemnification escrow agreement
in substantially the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit K_** (the "
_Indemnification Escrow Agreement_ "), among Purchaser, Seller and the escrow
agent named therein (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). The Indemnification Escrow
Amount will be held, invested and distributed in accordance with the terms of
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and in accordance with Article 10
hereof. On or before the date that falls eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller will provide joint instructions to the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller any amounts remaining in the escrow fund
(and not including any amount previously distributed therefrom in accordance
with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement) _minus_  the
aggregate amount of any claims that have been asserted on or prior to
such date and that remain outstanding (each, a " _Post Survival Claim_ "). At
such time as any Post Survival Claim is finally resolved, Purchaser and
Seller will provide joint instructions to pay to Purchaser the amount to
which it is entitled hereunder with respect to such Post Survival Claim and
to pay to Seller any remaining portion of the amount retained in the escrow
account after such payment is made.

  

1.4. _Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment_.

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver to Seller a calculation of Net Working Capital, together with
reasonably detailed supporting information (the " _Closing Statement_ "). For
purposes of this Section 1.4, " _Net Working Capital_ " means the aggregate
total current assets of the Companies (not including cash or cash
equivalents) _plus_ inventory purchased from the Asset Sellers _less_
Indebtedness of the Companies _less_ total current liabilities of the
Companies _less_ those liabilities set forth in _Schedule 1.4(a)_ , in each
case as determined as of the close of

     

   



  

business on the Closing Date and determined in a manner consistent with the
calculation of the Target Net Working Capital Amount.

  

(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser will provide Seller and its accountants
with access to the records and employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates and
will use its reasonable commercial efforts to provide Seller and its
accountants access to Purchasers accountants and the work papers of
Purchasers accountants, to the extent reasonably related to Sellers
evaluation of the Closing Statement, the calculation of the Net Working
Capital or the resolution of any dispute with respect thereto. Within thirty
(30) days after Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement, Seller shall
notify Purchaser in writing as to whether Seller disagrees with the Closing
Statement, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the particulars
of such disagreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the basis of any such
dispute shall be limited to the failure of the calculation of Net Working
Capital to have been determined in accordance with the definition of "Net
Working Capital" set forth in Section 1.4(a) above. In the event that Seller
does not provide a notice of disagreement within such 30-day period, then
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the calculations and the amounts set
forth in the Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser, which shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If any notice of
disagreement is timely provided in accordance with this Section 1.4(b),
Purchaser and Seller shall each use commercially reasonable efforts for a
period of twenty (20) days thereafter (or such longer period as they
may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the
calculations in the Closing Statement. If, at the end of such period,
Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreements as to items in
the Closing Statement, then the Parties shall engage Deloitte and Touche LLP
(the " _Auditor_ ") to resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall
be charged with determining as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within thirty (30) days after the date on which such dispute is referred to
the Auditor, whether the Net Working Capital as set forth in the Closing
Statement was prepared in accordance with this Agreement and (only with
respect to the disagreements as to the items set forth in the notice of
disagreement and submitted to the Auditor) whether and to what extent (if
any) Net Working Capital requires adjustment. The fees and expenses of the
Auditor shall be shared by Purchaser and Seller in inverse proportion to the
relative amounts of the disputed amounts determined in favor of Purchaser and
Seller, respectively. The determination of the Auditor shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. The date on which the Net
Working Capital is finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.4(b)
is hereinafter referred to as to the " _Determination Date_ ", and such
amount so finally determined (the " _Final Net Working Capital Amount_ ")
shall be used to determine the Purchase Price.

  

(c) Promptly following the Determination Date (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days of the Determination Date), if the Final Net Working
Capital Amount is less than the Target Net Working Capital Amount, Seller
shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the excess of the Target Net
Working Capital Amount _over_ the Final Net Working Capital Amount _provided,
however,_ that no amount shall be paid by Seller unless the difference
between the Target Net Working Capital Amount and the Final Net Working
Capital Amount is greater than $1,000,000 and then only to the extent of such
difference in excess of $1,000,000. Any payment or disbursement, as
applicable,

     

   



  

made pursuant to this Section 1.4(c) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in the amount specified.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
addition to the payment of the Purchase Price referred to in Section 1.2 and
the adjustments to the Purchase Price referred to in Section 1.4(c) above,
the Purchaser hereby agrees that on or immediately after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the amount of any cash of the Companies as of
the Closing Date by means of a wire transfer of immediately available U.S.
funds to one or more accounts designated by Seller to Purchaser.

  

1.5. _Closing_. The Closing will take place at the offices of International
Rectifier Corporation, 233 Kansas Street, El Segundo, California 90245, or at
such other place as Purchaser and Seller mutually agree, at 10:00 A.M. local
time, on the Closing Date. At the Closing, the Purchaser will deliver the
Indemnification Escrow Amount into an account designated by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and
there also shall be delivered to Seller and Purchaser the certificates and
other Contracts, documents and instruments to be delivered under _Articles
VI_ and _VII_.

  

1.6. _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or
from time to time after the Closing, each of the Parties shall, and shall
cause each of the Selling Subsidiaries and the PCS Purchasers (as applicable)
to, execute and deliver such other documents and instruments, provide such
materials and information and take such other actions as may reasonably be
necessary, proper or advisable, to the extent permitted by Law, to fulfill
its obligations under this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements to which
it is a party. Following the Closing, each Party will afford the other
Party, its counsel and its accountants, during normal business hours,
reasonable access to the books, records and other data relating to the
Companies and the PCS Business in its possession with respect to periods
prior to the Closing and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom, at
the requesting Partys expense, to the extent that such access may be
reasonably required by the requesting Party in connection with (i) the
preparation of financial reports or Tax Returns, (ii) the determination or
enforcement of rights and obligations under this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Agreements, (iii) compliance with the requirements of any
Governmental Authority, or (v) in connection with any actual or threatened
Action or Proceeding, but in each case only to the extent that such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the Party
providing such access. The requesting Party shall provide a written request
to access such information (which written request shall include the reason
for such partys request to access such information) within a reasonable time
prior to the requested date of access. Further, each Party agrees for
a period extending six (6) years after the Closing Date not to destroy
or otherwise dispose of any such books, records and other data unless such
Party shall first offer in writing to surrender such books, records and other
data to the other Party and such other Party does not agree in writing to
take possession thereof during the ten (10) day period after such offer
is made. Any information obtained by a

     

   



  

Party in accordance with this subsection shall be held confidential by such
Party in accordance with _Section 12.4_.

  

(b) If, in order properly to prepare its Tax Returns, other documents or
reports required to be filed with Governmental Authorities or its financial
statements or to fulfill its obligations hereunder, it is necessary that a
Party be furnished with additional information, documents or records relating
to the Companies, the Acquired Assets and the PCS Business not referred to in
subsection (a) above, and such information, documents or records are in the
possession or control of the other Party, such other Party agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish or make available such
information, documents or records (or copies thereof) at the requesting
Partys request, cost and expense. Any information obtained by a Party
in accordance with this subsection shall be held confidential by such Party
in accordance with _Section 12.4_.

  

(c) Nothing in this _Section 1.6_ or any other provision of this Agreement,
any Purchase Agreement or any Transaction Agreement shall require disclosure
of (i) any Tax Return of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller other than the
Companies (although disclosure of information on such Tax Returns may be
required) or (ii) any attorney-client communication, any attorney work
product, or any otherwise privileged document or information.

Purchaser true and complete copies of the unaudited special-purpose statement
of assets and liabilities of the PCS Business and the related unaudited
special-purpose statement of revenues less direct and certain allocated
expenses before income taxes for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and
2006, including the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005
(the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ "). Except as set forth in the notes
thereto and as disclosed in _Schedule 2.8_ , the Unaudited Financial
Statements fairly present in all material respects the net assets of the PCS
Business (other than the SIP Modules, Gen 5.5 Technology and Gen 6
Technology) and its revenue less direct and certain allocated expenses before
taxes for the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2006, on the basis of accounting
described in Note 1 (for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 attached
thereto).  Subject to Note 1 (for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005),
the Unaudited Financial Statements have been derived from the historical
accounting records of the Seller and its Subsidiaries and reflect significant
allocations and managements estimates of the costs of goods and services
provided to the PCS Business by the Seller and its Affiliates.  The
Unaudited Financial Statements (i) are not intended to be a presentation in
conformity with GAAP and (ii) do not necessarily represent the net assets and
revenues less direct and certain allocated expenses before taxes of the PCS
Business (not including the SIP Modules, Gen 5.5 Technology and Gen 6
Technology) had it been operated as a separate legal entity.

  

(b) No material revenues from any products identified in _Section 12.1_ as
being excluded from the agreement of Seller not to compete are reflected in
the results of operation of the PCS Business included in the Unaudited
Financial Statements or to be included in the Audited Financial Statements.

  

(c) Except for the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
transactions to take place pursuant hereto on or prior to the Closing Date
and as disclosed in _Schedule 2.8_ , since June 30, 2006 until the date
hereof, the PCS Business has been operated in all material respects in the
ordinary course.

  

2.9. _Absence of Certain Business Practices_. To the Knowledge of Seller, none
of the Seller, any Company or any Selling Subsidiary, nor any other person
acting with authority on behalf of any of them, has, in connection with the
PCS Business, used any corporate funds for any unlawful contribution, gift,
entertainment or other unlawful expense relating to political activity, or
made any direct or indirect unlawful payment in material violation of any
provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended. [***] Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

     

   



  

2.10. _Customers and Supplier Relationships_. _Schedule 2.10_ sets forth (a)
the ten largest customers of the PCS Business and (b) the five largest
suppliers for lead frame and mold compounds of the PCS Business, in each case
on the basis of cost of goods or services purchased for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2006 (collectively, the " _Customers and Suppliers_ ").  To the
Knowledge of Seller, there is no plan or intention on the part of any of the
Customers or Suppliers (i) to terminate or materially reduce purchases from
the PCS Business, (ii) to terminate or reduce the supply of lead frame or
mold compounds to the PCS Business or (iii) to materially and adversely
change the terms of the sales or supply agreements or similar arrangements
with the Seller or any Company in connection with the PCS Business (other
than price increases for supply agreements in the normal course of business).

  

2.11. _Brokers_. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co., whose fees, commissions and
expenses are the sole responsibility of Seller, all negotiations relative to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby have been carried out
by Seller directly with Purchaser without the intervention of any Person on
behalf of Seller in such manner as to give rise to any valid claim by any
Person against Purchaser or any Company after Closing for a finders fee,
brokerage commission or similar payment.

  

2.12. _No Undisclosed Liabilities._ To the Knowledge of Seller, the PCS
Business does not have any Liabilities of a nature required by GAAP to be
reflected on or disclosed in the footnotes to a balance sheet, except
for (i) Liabilities disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the
Unaudited Financial Statements, (ii) Liabilities incurred since the date of
the most recent Unaudited Financial Statements in the ordinary course of
business, (iii) the matters disclosed in or arising out of matters set forth
on the Schedules to this Agreement or which are the subject of other
representations and warranties set forth herein, (iv) Liabilities and
obligations incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (v) Liabilities or obligations which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is
made pursuant to this Section 2.12 with respect to any matter that is
specifically addressed by another representation or warranty contained in
this Article II.

  

2.13. _Intellectual Property_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.13_ ,

  

(a) To the Knowledge of Seller, all of the intellectual property rights owned
by Seller, directly or indirectly, that are used in the PCS Business as
presently conducted by Seller and the Companies (other than trademarks,
service marks, logos or other product identifiers used in the PCS Business)
are to be acquired by or licensed to Purchaser, directly and indirectly, as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreements, the Technology License Agreements and the Trademark License
Agreements.

  

(b) The license granted to Purchaser pursuant to the Technology License
Agreements includes a license for all intellectual property owned by Seller
which Seller intended to use in the PCS Business pursuant to research and
development activity that is currently in process and for which the PCS
Business has already expended development efforts and costs.

     

   



  

2.14. _Inventory_. The inventory of the PCS Business (other than the SIP
Modules, Gen 5.5 Technology and Gen 6 Technology) as of June 30, 2006 and all
additions thereafter acquired and on hand as of the date hereof (not having
been disposed of since June 30, 2006 in the ordinary course of
business) (collectively, the " _Inventory_ ") is in all material respects of
a quantity and quality usable or saleable in the ordinary course of the
business, subject to the applicable reserves set forth in the Unaudited
Financial Statements. All additions to the Inventory acquired since June 30,
2006 were acquired in the ordinary course of business. Obsolete,
discontinued, returned, damaged, overage or off quality items do not
constitute a material part of the Inventory and are carried on the Unaudited
Financial Statements for the period ending June 30, 2006 in accordance with
Note 1 and Note 2 to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2005. Finished goods in Inventory conform to published
specifications, are free from material defects and are marketable
and saleable in the ordinary course of business.  All Inventory not written
off or reserved against has been recorded on the books of the PCS Business at
the lower of cost or market value determined in accordance with Note 1 and
Note 2 to the Unaudited Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2005.

  

2.15. _Accounts and Notes Receivable and Payable_. All accounts and notes
receivable of the PCS Business (other than the SIP Modules, Gen 5.5
Technology and Gen 6 Technology) as of June 30, 2006 have arisen in

 COVENANTS OF PURCHASER

  

Purchaser covenants and agrees with Seller that, at all times from and after
the date hereof until the Closing and, in the case of _Section 5.2_,
thereafter, Purchaser will comply with all covenants and provisions of this
_Article V_, except to the extent Seller may otherwise consent in writing.

     

   



  

5.1. _Regulatory and Other Approvals_. Purchaser will, and will cause each
other PCS Purchaser, as promptly as practicable to:

  

(a) take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or desirable to obtain

Governmental Authorities or any other Person required of Purchaser or any
other PCS Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by

the damages that might result from any actual or threatened breach of this
_Section 5.2_ and that such actual or threatened breach by it may result in
immediate, irreparable and continuing injury to the other Party and that a
remedy at law for any such actual or threatened breach may be inadequate.
 Accordingly, the Parties agree that the non-breaching Party, in its
sole discretion and in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or
in equity, shall be entitled to seek temporary, preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief or other equitable relief, issued by a court of

documents) of any Company that provides for indemnification of directors,
officers or employees (including an amendment effected through a merger,
consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, liquidation or
dissolution of any such corporation), if the effect of such amendment would
be to adversely affect the rights provided thereby to any Person who shall
have served as a director, officer or employee of such Company prior to the
Closing Date in respect of actions taken in such capacity on or prior to the
Closing Date, unless such Person would immediately thereafter be entitled to
indemnification by Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof comparable to that
provided by the affected provision prior to any such amendment (including
without limitation pursuant to a contractual obligation on the part of
Purchaser or its Affiliate that is substantively equivalent in all respect to
such provision providing for such indemnification) _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller and its Affiliates will not pursue any Action or claims against
any such director, officer or employee after the Closing Date relating to the
conduct of any such director, officer or employee prior to the Closing Date.

of the other PCS Purchasers to, promptly supplement or amend the Schedules
hereto with respect to any matter arising after the date hereof that, if
existing at, or occurring on, the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described on any Schedule. Except as set forth in
_Section 10.1(b)_ or _Section 13.13(d)_, no supplement or amendment of
the Schedules made after the execution hereof by Purchaser pursuant to this
Section or otherwise shall be deemed to cure any breach of any representation
of or warranty made pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of the other PCS Purchasers to,
give notice to Seller promptly after becoming aware of the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event or circumstance which would cause any condition to
Closing not to be satisfied. In such event, the Purchaser will and will cause
each other PCS Purchaser to, use its reasonable efforts to prevent

(vii) any Liabilities incurred prior to the Closing Date by a Company

10.3. _Notice of Claims_.

  

(a) In the event Purchaser or Seller seeks indemnification hereunder (such
Party, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") such Party shall give promptly to the
Party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the "
_Indemnitor_ ") a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount
or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to
the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim
is based; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party
to give the Claim Notice promptly as required by this _Section 10.3_ shall
not affect such Indemnified Partys rights under this _Article X_ except to
the extent such failure is actually prejudicial to the Indemnitors defense
of such claim.

  

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article X_ shall be determined: (i) by written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree in writing. The judgment
or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any,
shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals
taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have
the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it. All
amounts due to the Indemnified Party as so finally determined shall be paid
by wire transfer within thirty (30) days after such final determination.

  

10.4. _Third Party Claims_.

  

(a) In order for a Person to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or
demand made by any third Person against the Indemnified Party (each such
claim, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim
promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the
Third Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver
to the Indemnitor, and in any event within 7 Business Days, after
the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third Party Claim (or such earlier time as may be necessary to enable
the Indemnitor to respond to the court proceedings on a timely basis). The
failure of any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnitor notice of the Third
Party Claim, or copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)

     

   



  

received by the Indemnified Party relating thereto, as required by this
_Section 10.4(a)_ , shall not affect such Indemnified Partys rights under
this _Article X_ except to the extent such failure is prejudicial to the
Indemnitors defense of such claim.

  

(b) In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the
Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to
appoint counsel at the Indemnitors expense to represent the Indemnified
Party in, and to control, any action for which indemnification is sought (in
which case the Indemnitor shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees
and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the Indemnified Party,
except as set forth below) provided, however, that such counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the
Indemnitors election to appoint counsel to represent the Indemnified Party
in an action, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel (including local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction), and to
control the action, and the Indemnitor shall bear the reasonable fees, costs
and expenses of such separate counsel, if

  

(i) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that the use of counsel
chosen by the Indemnitor to represent the Indemnified Party would result in a
conflict of interest and the Indemnitor shall not have chosen alternative
counsel,

  

(ii) the actual defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnitor, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded that there are legal defenses available to it which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party,

  

(iii) the Indemnitor shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party within a
reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or

  

(iv) the Indemnitor shall authorize the Indemnified Party to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the Indemnitor.

  

The Party controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim shall keep the
non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and shall consider in good faith the recommendations made by
the non-controlling Party with respect thereto.

  

(c) Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle or compromise
any such proceeding, which settlement or compromise obligates the other Party
to pay money, to perform obligations or to admit liability without the
written consent of such other Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_  that the consent of the Indemnified Party
shall not be required if the Indemnitor agrees in writing to pay any amounts
payable pursuant to such settlement or compromise and such settlement or
compromise includes a complete written release of the Indemnified Party from
further liability, does not admit to the culpability of the

     

   



  

Indemnified Party, and does not impose any injunctive relief or other
operational restrictions on the Indemnified Party.

  

(d) The Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other, as reasonably
requested by the other, in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or demand. Such cooperation
shall include retention and the provision of records and information which
are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  

(e) After any final Order shall have been rendered and the time in which to
appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnifiable by
the Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter
and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified
Party by wire transfer within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice.

  

(f) If an Indemnitor is required to pay the fees, costs and expenses of
separate counsel retained by an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
10.4(b)_ , the Indemnitor shall pay such fees, costs and expenses as they are
incurred and billed, unless and to the extent the Indemnitor disputes such
fees, costs and expenses in good faith.

  

10.5. _Limitations_.

  

(a) Any indemnity payment hereunder shall be treated for Tax purposes as an
adjustment of the Purchase Price to the extent such characterization is
proper or permissible under relevant Tax Law, including court decisions,
statutes, regulations and administrative promulgations.

  

(b) The limitations set forth in  _Sections 10.1_ , _10.2_ and _10.9_ shall
not apply to Losses arising from or with respect to: (i) fraud or
intentional misconduct; (ii) any Excluded Liabilities; (iii) any breach of
representations and warranties relating to authority, ownership of the Shares
or any other equity securities of any of the Companies or of the Acquired
Assets, or brokers fees; (iv) any Assumed Liabilities; (v) the operations of
any Company after the Closing Date; (vi) any covenant to be performed by any
Party after the Closing Date, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any
obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement to pay Taxes with respect to
periods ending on or before Closing (or, in the case of Straddle Periods, any
Pre-Closing Partial Period (in each case as defined in the Tax Matters
Agreement)) shall be construed as a covenant to be performed prior
to Closing; (vii) any Liabilities under any (A) retention agreement entered
into prior to the Closing Date with any employee of the Seller or a Company
or (B) employment or similar agreement entered into prior to the Closing Date
with any employee of the Seller or a Company that entitles such employee to
compensation or other consideration as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (in each case referred to in this clause (B)
other than any employment or severance

     

   



  

obligations customary or otherwise required by applicable Law in the country
or jurisdiction of the relevant Company); (viii) any Liabilities incurred
prior to the Closing Date by a Company primarily attributable to any business
of the Seller or its Affiliates other than the PCS Business; and (ix)
Liabilities of any Company exclusively related to those transactions
expressly identified in _Schedule 7.15_ attached hereto.

  

(c) For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses, such amount shall
be reduced by the amount of any insurance benefits and proceeds actually
received by or otherwise payable to Purchaser or any Company in respect of
the Losses (net of any deductible amounts).

  

(d) In calculating any Loss there shall be deducted any indemnification,
contribution or other similar payment actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party or any Affiliate thereof from any third Person with respect thereto.
 All such amounts received by an Indemnified Party with respect to
any indemnity claim after it has received an indemnity payment hereunder
shall be promptly paid over to the Indemnitor; _provided_ that the
Indemnified Party shall not be obligated to pay over any such amount in
excess of the amount paid by the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such claim.

  

(e) No Party shall have any Liability for any special, exemplary, punitive or
consequential damages (including loss of profit or revenue) suffered or
incurred by either Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be; _provided,_ that
in the event a Party is required to pay to a third-party claimant any
indirect, special, exemplary, incidental, punitive or consequential damages,
or any loss of profits, revenues or business opportunity, for any claim with
respect to which such Party is indemnified by the other Party pursuant to
this Agreement, such Party shall be entitled to indemnification from the
other Party with respect to such indirect, special, exemplary, incidental,
punitive or consequential damages, or any loss of profits, revenues or
business opportunity, to the extent resulting from the otherwise
indemnifiable act or omission of the other Party.

  

(f) Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall have no Liability under any
provisions of this Agreement for any Losses to the extent that such Losses
relate to or arise out of actions taken or omitted to be taken by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates with respect to any Company or the Acquired Assets
after the Closing Date.

  

10.6. _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article X,_ the Indemnitor shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the
Indemnified Party may have against any third-person with respect to the
subject matter underlying such indemnification claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnitor.

  

10.7. _No Offset_. The obligations hereunder of Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, are independent of the obligations of the other
hereunder and shall not be subject to any right of offset, counterclaim or
deduction.

     

   



  

10.8. _Exclusivity_. After the Closing, other than for fraud or intentional
misconduct and to the extent permitted by Law, the indemnities set forth in
this _Article X_ shall be the exclusive remedies of Purchaser and Seller and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates for
any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any Purchase
Agreement, and the Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this
Agreement or any Purchase Agreement or to any further indemnification rights
or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the
Parties hereby waive.

  

10.9. _Indemnity for Infringement_.

  

(a) After the Closing Date, and subject to the limitations set forth herein,
Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser Indemnitee from
any Losses incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee arising from any claim
alleging infringement, misappropriation or misuse by Seller or its Affiliates
within the past five (5) years, or by a Purchaser Indemnitee during the
thirty (30) months following the Closing, of any Intellectual Property or
other proprietary information of another Person (" _Infringement Claims_ ")
relating to the manufacture, use, sale or importation of any product of the
PCS Business as such business exists on the Closing Date or any discontinued
product of the PCS Business sold prior to the Closing Date (" _Infringement
Losses_ "); provided, however, that subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article X, (i) Seller shall be responsible for 60% of all Infringement
Losses incurred by a Purchaser Indemnitee and Purchaser shall be responsible
for 40% of such Infringement Losses and (ii) Sellers obligations under this
Section 10.9(a) shall terminate upon the thirtieth (30th) month anniversary
of the Closing Date (it being agreed, however, that if an indemnification
claim is properly asserted under Section 10.3 hereof prior to the thirtieth
(30th) month anniversary, then Sellers indemnification obligation hereunder
shall survive until, but only for the purposes of, the resolution of such
claim). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Infringement Claims do not include
"trolling letters" or other communications notifying a Party of the existence
of a patent or other Intellectual Property of another Person.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller
shall have an indemnification obligation for any Infringement Losses under
Section 10.9(a) only to the extent that:(i) the amount Infringement Loss
suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees related to each individual claim or
series of related claims exceeds $100,000 and (ii) the amount of such
Infringement Losses, together with all other Losses of the Purchaser
Indemnitees under Section 10.1(a) hereof, exceed $2,000,000 and then only in
respect of such excess; provided that (A) except as otherwise set forth in
sub-clause (B) below, the aggregate amount required to be paid by Seller
pursuant to this Section 10.9, together with all amounts required to be paid
by Seller under Section 10.1(a), shall not exceed 15% of the Purchase Price
and (B) the aggregate amount required to be paid by Seller pursuant to this
Section 10.9 shall be $5,000,000 in respect of any and all Infringement
Claims (x) which are not expressly disclosed in either _Schedule 3.8(c)_
(excluding item 1 thereof) of the Disclosure Schedules of the Asset Purchase
Agreement or in _Schedule 2.11_ of the Disclosure Schedules of the Share
Purchase Agreements and (y) for which Seller has otherwise not received
written notice within the last five (5) years.

     

   



  

(c) Sellers indemnification obligation under Section 10.9(a) is subject to
Purchaser and its Affiliates (i) providing reasonable cooperation and
assistance (including without limitation reasonable access to relevant
documentation in the possession of Purchaser or its Affiliates in respect of
Intellectual Property) to Seller in the defense of any Infringement Claim and
(ii) asserting, or permitting Seller to assert, against the claimant any
Intellectual Property of Purchaser or its Affiliate that reasonably may be of
assistance in the defense of such Infringement Claim; provided that, in the
case of clause (ii) above, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be required
to assert, or to permit Seller to assert, any Intellectual Property which is
not acquired pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements if the
Purchaser believes that such action would be adverse to the business or
operations of the Purchaser and its Affiliates. The parties agree that (A)
any information provided by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 10.9(c) in
respect of Intellectual Property, and any cooperation in connection
therewith, shall be subject to a joint defense agreement in a form reasonably
acceptable to Seller and Purchaser providing for, among other things,
privileged communications relating to joint defense and (B) any dispute
between the Parties relating to the obligations of Purchaser under clause
(ii) of this Section 10.9(c) shall be resolved by binding arbitration.

  

(d) The Seller shall have no indemnification obligations under this Section
10.9 to the extent that such Infringement Losses result, in whole or in part,
from: (i) any claims or Actions initiated by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing Date against the Person making the Infringement
Claim or any of its Affiliates (including without limitation any
counterclaims brought by any such Person against Purchaser or its
Affiliates); (ii) any infringement, misappropriation or misuse resulting from
any alterations or modifications to existing products or any new products of
the PCS Business after the Closing Date (including any improvements or other
developments relating to such products); or [***]

Purchaser;

  

(b) At any time before the Closing, by Seller or Purchaser, in the event that
any Order or Law becomes effective restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting [***] Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted information.

     

   



  

or making illegal the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any Purchase Agreement, upon notification to the other
Party;

  

(c) If any of the Purchase Agreements shall be terminated in accordance with
its terms;

  

(d) By Purchaser or Seller, if any representation or warranty of Seller or
Purchaser, respectively, set forth in this Agreement shall be untrue when
made or shall become untrue, such that the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ or _7.1_ , as the case may be, would not be satisfied; _provided_ that,
if such misrepresentation is curable prior to February 26, 2007 by Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, through the exercise of its reasonable
commercial efforts to eliminate, undo or reverse the event or circumstance
giving rise to such misrepresentation and for so long as Seller or Purchaser,
as the case may be, continues to exercise such reasonable commercial efforts,
neither Purchaser nor Seller, respectively, may terminate this Agreement
under this clause at any time prior to February 26, 2007;

  

(e) By Purchaser or Seller, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of Seller or Purchaser, respectively, set forth in this Agreement, such
that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _7.1_ , as the case may be,
would not be satisfied; _provided_ that, if such breach is curable prior to
February 26, 2007 by Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, through the
exercise of its reasonable commercial efforts to eliminate, undo or reverse
the event or circumstance giving rise to such breach and for so long as
Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, continues to exercise such
reasonable commercial efforts, neither Purchaser nor Seller, respectively,
may terminate this Agreement under this clause at any time prior to February
26, 2007; or

  

(f) At any time after February 26, 2007 by Seller or Purchaser upon
notification to the other Party if the Closing shall not have occurred and
such failure to consummate is not caused by a breach of this Agreement by the
terminating Party.

  

11.2. _Effect of Termination_.

  

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 11.1_, this
Agreement and the Purchase Agreements will forthwith become null and void,
and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of Seller, the
Selling Subsidiaries or Purchaser (or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives or
Affiliates), except (i) that the provisions with respect to confidentiality
in _Section 12.4_ and expenses in _Section 13.2_ will continue to apply
following any such termination, and (ii) no such termination shall relieve
either Party of the consequences of any intentional or willful breach of or
misrepresentation in the Agreement or in any Purchase Agreement or
Transaction Agreement.

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated and there shall have a occurred an
intentional or willful breach or misrepresentation by a Party, Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, may seek such remedies, including damages and
attorneys fees, against the

     

   



  

other with respect to any such breach or misrepresentation as are provided in
this Agreement, any Purchase Agreement or as are otherwise available at Law
or in equity.

  

ARTICLE XII 
 NON-COMPETITION; NON-SOLICITATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

  

12.1. _Agreement Not to Compete_.

  

(a) For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, Seller shall not,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly: engage
in the PCS Business (as defined below) anywhere in the world. However,
Seller and its Affiliates will not be prohibited from designing,
manufacturing or selling any of the products listed below.  International
Rectifier will be required to represent that no products from these
categories are included in the sales figures for the PCS Business presented
to Vishay. Except as stated below, Seller agrees not to sell any planar
silicon or silicon carbide: discrete FETs transistors; discrete thyristors;
discrete (planar or non-planar) diodes or rectifiers; Schottky rectifiers
(planar or non-planar) or multi-chip modules not containing integrated
circuits. Seller further agrees not to introduce any new die in any package
in planar discrete silicon or silicon carbide FETs for the duration of the
Non-competition covenant.

  

(b) (i) Discrete planar MOSFETs: (A) Gen 5.x and Gen 7.x planar silicon
discrete MOSFETs two-hundred volts and below, (B) MOSFETs for Hi-Rel
aerospace, Hi-Rel defense and Hi-Rel medical applications only and (C)
Stacked EPI (P column or Superjunction) silicon transistors in support of the

Hi-Rel aerospace, Hi-Rel defense and Hi-Rel medical applications only; and
(iii) Modules: (A) multi-chip modules containing diodes, MOSFETs or IGBTs for
Hi-Rel aerospace, Hi-Rel defense and Hi-Rel medical applications only and (B)
a Dual FetKy Module (IRF 7335) which is 3 die 14 pin DIP.

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby agree that nothing in this
Non-Compete covenant shall prevent Seller or its Affiliates from competing
against any products of the PCS Business with functional or application
competitive products, as long as such competing products do not belong to any
of the product families comprising the PCS Business. Examples include but
are not limited to IGBTs that replace high-voltage MOSFETs, Trench
Mosfets replacing Shottky diodes and integrated circuits replacing MOSFETS or
Diodes.

  

(d) Any Restricted Person may engage in any manner in any activity that would
otherwise violate Section 12.1(a) if such activity is conducted by a Person
or business that is purchased or otherwise acquired by a Restricted Person
after the date of this Agreement by merger or by acquisition of assets, stock
or otherwise (an " _Acquired Business_ "), so long as either (i) the annual
consolidated gross revenues for the immediately preceding full fiscal year
derived from that portion of the Acquired Business that constitutes the PCS
Business (comprising the silicon and silicon carbide product

     

   



  

families thereof) do not exceed the lesser of (A) 10% of the consolidated
revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 attributable to the
relevant silicon and silicon carbide product families of the PCS Business in
which the Acquired Business competes and (b) $10 million in the aggregate
or (ii) such Restricted Person substantially completes a divestiture
or termination of that portion of the Acquired Business that would
cause non-compliance with this _Section 12.1_ within twenty-four (24)
months following the date of purchase or other acquisition.

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without implicitly agreeing that the
following activities would be prohibited by the provisions of Section
12.1(a), nothing in this Agreement shall preclude, prohibit, or restrict any
Restricted Person from (i) acquiring, owning or managing exclusively for the
account of unaffiliated third parties (which may include, without limitation,
employees of a Restricted Person) through a mutual fund, employee benefit
plan, pension fund, trust account, or investment pool or vehicle, any class
of securities of any Person regardless of whether such Person engages in (or
owns or acquires an equity interest in a Person that engages in) the PCS
Business or (ii) making De Minimus Investments.

  

(f) The terms defined in this _Section 12.1(d)_ , whenever used herein, shall
have the following meanings for the purposes of this _Section 12.1_ :

  

" _Acquired Business_ " shall have the meaning set forth in Section 12.1(d).

  

" _De Minimus Investment_ " means an equity investment in (a) Advanced Power
Electronics Corporation, (b) Nihon Inter Electronics Corp. and (c) any other
Person in which (i) Restricted Persons collectively hold not more than 10% of
the outstanding voting securities or other similar equity interests, and (ii)
such equity investment is held as a passive investment only and not with a
view towards controlling, directing or influencing the affairs of such
Person.

  

" _Restricted Person_ " means the Seller and its Affiliates.

  

12.2. _Non-Interference_. For a period of 18 months from the Closing Date,
(i) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will take any action, directly
or indirectly, that is designed or intended to disparage the PCS Business;
provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions
of this Section 12.2 are not intended to prohibit Seller from marketing to
any customer any product that Seller is not prohibited from designing,
manufacturing or selling pursuant to Section 12.1 above, and (ii)
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will take any action, directly or
indirectly, that is designed or intended to disparage Sellers reputation,
past practices or conduct with respect to the PCS Business.

  

12.3. _Non-Solicitation_.

  

(a) For a period of 18 months from the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates will employ, engage or seek to employ or engage any Person
who within the prior twelve (12) months had been an officer or employee of
any Company or the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in respect of the PCS
Business or otherwise was introduced and became known to Seller as a result
of the transactions contemplated

     

   



  

hereby, unless such officer or employee (i) resigns voluntarily (without any
solicitation from Seller or any of its Affiliates) or (ii) is terminated by
such Company or Purchaser after the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
prohibitions set forth in this Section 12.3(a) shall not be breached by
general solicitations to the public or general advertising (whether or not
such employees contact Seller or an Affiliate as a result thereof).

  

(b) For a period of 18 months from the Closing Date, except as otherwise
contemplated pursuant to the Purchase Agreements, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates will employ, engage or seek to employ or engage any Person
who within the prior twelve (12) months had been an officer or employee of
the Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of the PCS Business or
otherwise was introduced and became known to Purchaser as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby, unless such officer or employee (i) resigns
voluntarily (without any solicitation from Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates) or (ii) is terminated by Seller or its Affiliates after the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the prohibitions set forth in this
Section 12.3(b) shall not be breached by general solicitations to the public
or general advertising (whether or not such employees contact Purchaser or an
Affiliate as a result thereof).

  

12.4. _Confidentiality_.

  

(a) Until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, each Party hereto will
hold, and will use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates, and in the case
of Purchaser, any Person who has provided, or who is considering providing,
financing to Purchaser to finance all or any portion of the Purchase Price,
and their respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any
Person (other than any such Affiliate, Person who has provided, or who is
considering providing, financing or its Representative), all Confidential
Information (as defined below) of the other Party or any of its Affiliates
furnished to it by the other Party or such other Partys Representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
except Confidential Information that (i) a Party is compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process (including without limitation in
connection with obtaining the necessary approvals of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby of Governmental Authorities) or by other
requirements of Law; (ii) is disclosed in an Action or Proceeding brought by
a Party in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies
hereunder; (iii) is in the public domain (either prior to or after the
furnishing of such documents or information hereunder) through no fault of
such receiving Party; or (iv) is later acquired by the receiving Party from
another source if the receiving Party is not aware that such source is under
any obligation to keep such documents and information confidential, _provided_
that, until the twentieth anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Party
shall (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) intentionally publish any
Confidential Information of the other Party.

  

(b) " _Confidential Information_ " means any information, documents or other
materials of the Party or any of its Affiliates (whether written, oral,
graphic or electronic) which is generally regarded as confidential or
proprietary, including, without limitation: (i) names and addresses of
customers and vendors and information concerning transactions or relations
therewith; (ii) information concerning any product, technology,

     

   



  

process or procedure not generally known to the public, customers, vendors or
competitors, or under development by or being tested but not at the time
offered generally to its customers or vendors; (iii) information relating to
computer software and systems other than off-the-shelf software and systems
furnished by third party vendors; (iv) business plans, budgets, advertising
and marketing plans, pricing and marketing methods, sales margins, cost of
goods, cost of material, capital structure, operating results, and financial
arrangements; and (v) information belonging to customers and vendors and any
other Person which by agreement is held in confidence. Following
the Closing, all Confidential Information of the Companies, or of the Seller
or any of its Affiliates to the extent transferred to Purchaser or relating
to the Companies or the Acquired Assets shall be deemed Confidential
Information of the Purchaser and not of the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

(c) In the event the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated,
upon the request of the other Party, each Party will, and will cause its
Affiliates, any Person who has provided, or who is providing, financing to
such Party and their respective Representatives to, promptly redeliver or
cause to be redelivered all copies of confidential documents and information
furnished by the other Party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and destroy or cause to be destroyed all
notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings
related thereto or based thereon prepared by the Party or its
Representatives.

  

12.5. _Remedies_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it would be
difficult to measure the damages that might result from any actual
or threatened breach of _Article XII_ and that such actual or threatened
breach by it may result in immediate, irreparable and continuing injury to
the other Party and that a remedy at law for any such actual or threatened
breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties agree that the non-
breaching Party, in its sole discretion and in addition to any other remedies
it may have at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief or other equitable
relief, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, in case of any such
actual or threatened breach (without the necessity of actual injury being
proved).

13.5. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by a written instrument duly executed by each Party.

  

13.6. _No Third Party Beneficiary_. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of
the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person
other than a Person entitled to indemnity under _Article X._

  

13.7. _No Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any
right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by either Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party and any attempt to do so
will be void, except (a) for assignments and transfers by operation of Law
and (b) that Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary, provided that
such subsidiary agrees in writing to be bound by all of the provisions
contained herein, but no such assignment referred to in clause (b) shall
relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.  Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect
and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision
or by its severance herefrom.

  

13.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to a Contract
executed and performed in such State, without giving effect to the conflicts
of laws principles thereof.

  

13.11. _Disputes; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Except to the extent
that a court proceeding or other Action is necessary to obtain an injunction
or other equitable relief to protect the rights of a Party, no Action or
other proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be
commenced until thirty (30) days after a Party shall give notice of the
existence of a dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the other Party. During
such 30-day period, duly authorized representatives of both Parties shall
attempt to negotiate in good faith a resolution of the dispute. The Dispute
Notice shall set forth the basis of the dispute with reasonably specificity.
 The Parties hereby agree that any Action or Proceeding arising out of
or related to this Agreement may be conducted in the State of Delaware. Each
Party hereby irrevocably consents and submits to the non-exclusive personal
jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in the
State of Delaware. Each Party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each Party agrees that
service of any summons, complaint or other initial pleading made in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 13.1_ shall be
effective service in such Action or Proceeding. Nothing in this
_Section 13.11_ , however, shall affect the right of a Party to serve such
summons, complaint or initial pleading in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

13.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

  

13.13. _Interpretation_.

  

(a) The Schedules referred to herein and in the Purchase Agreements are an
integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth
verbatim herein. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule referenced by
a particular Section in this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreements to the extent that such disclosure is
reasonably apparent to a reader of such disclosure.

  

(b) Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is intended to imply that such
amount,

     

   



  

or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or
are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any
such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements.

  

(c) Unless this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements specifically provide
otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty nor the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or
matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business, and no Party
shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or
matter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule
is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreements.

  

(d) Either Party may, from time to time until ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing supplement, amend or create any Schedule in this Agreement or any
of the Purchase Agreements, in order to add information or correct previously
supplied information. No such supplement, amendment or addition shall be
evidence, in and of itself, that the representations and warranties in the
corresponding Section are no longer true and correct in all
material respects. It is specifically agreed that such Schedules may be
supplemented, amended and/or added to, to add immaterial, as well as
material, items thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreements, (a) in the event that any supplements
or amendments to any Schedule or any newly created Schedules pursuant to this
_Section 13.13(d)_ disclose any event, condition or state of facts that,
individually or in the aggregate with all other such supplements, amendments

all or any portion of the Purchase Price, and their respective
Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any Person (other than any
such Affiliate, Person who has provided, or who is considering providing,
financing or its Representative), all Confidential Information included in
the Licensed IP Rights, except Confidential Information that (i) a Party is
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process (including
without limitation in connection with obtaining the necessary approvals of
this Technology Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby of
Governmental Authorities) or by other requirements of Law; (ii) is disclosed
in an Action or Proceeding brought by a Party in pursuit of its rights or in
the exercise of its remedies hereunder; (iii) is in the public domain (either
prior to or after the furnishing of such documents or information hereunder)
through no fault of Purchaser; or (iv) is later acquired by Purchaser from
another

the damages that might result from any actual or threatened breach of this
_Article V_ and that such actual or threatened breach by it may result in
immediate, irreparable and continuing

   



  

   

injury to IR and that a remedy at law for any such actual or threatened

discretion and in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or in
equity, shall be entitled to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent

assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver is appointed for it,
or it otherwise takes advantage of any insolvency law, the other Party may
terminate this Technology Agreement upon one (1) days written notice.

  

6.3 All licenses granted under this Technology Agreement shall be deemed
licenses of "intellectual property rights" as defined in Section 365(n) of
Title IX, U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and each such license shall be governed by

the protection of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, Purchaser shall have
the further option to elect termination of this Technology Agreement
but retain all rights under the licenses granted in Article 2 to support
its then-existing customers and sublicensees; to dispose, in any manner, of
all Licensed Products and inventory related thereto; and to properly
discharge any and all of Purchasers third party obligations relating to
Licensed Products incurred prior to the termination.

AGREEMENT OR THE LICENSED IP RIGHTS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT,
TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF

     

   



  

SUCH PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES OR SHOULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES.

  

ARTICLE V ** _ Confidentiality_**

  

5.1. Until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, IR will hold, and
will use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any Person, all
Confidential Information included in the Licensed IP Rights, except
Confidential Information that (i) a Party is compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process (including without limitation in
connection with obtaining the necessary approvals of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby of Governmental Authorities) or by other
requirements of Law; (ii) is disclosed in an Action or Proceeding brought by
a Party in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its
remedies hereunder; (iii) is in the public domain (either prior to or after
the furnishing of such documents or information hereunder) through no fault
of IR; or (iv) is later acquired by IR from another source if IR is not aware
that such source is under any obligation to keep such documents and
information confidential, _provided_ that, until the twentieth anniversary
of the Closing Date, IR shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to)
intentionally publish any Confidential Information of Purchaser.

  

5.2. " _Confidential Information_ " means any information, documents or other
materials of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (whether written, oral,
graphic or electronic) included in the Licensed IP Rights which is generally
regarded as confidential or proprietary, including, without limitation: (i)
names and addresses of customers and vendors and information concerning
transactions or relations therewith; (ii) information concerning any product,
technology, process or procedure not generally known to the public,
customers, vendors or competitors, or under development by or being tested
but not at the time offered generally to its customers or vendors; (iii)
information relating to computer software and systems other than off-the-
shelf software and systems furnished by third party vendors; (iv) business
plans, budgets, advertising and marketing plans, pricing and marketing
methods, sales margins, cost of goods, cost of material, capital structure,
operating results, and financial arrangements; and (v) information belonging
to customers and vendors and any other Person which by agreement is

     

   



  

held in confidence. Confidential Information which Purchaser discloses to IR
shall remain the property of Purchaser.

  

5.3. In the event the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated,
upon the request of IR, Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates, any
Person who has provided, or who is providing, financing to Purchaser and
their respective Representatives to, promptly redeliver or cause to be
redelivered all copies of confidential documents and information furnished by
IR under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and destroy
or cause to be destroyed all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses,
compilations and other writings related thereto or based thereon prepared by
Purchaser or its Representatives.

  

5.4. IR acknowledges and agrees that it would be difficult to measure the
damages that might result from any actual or threatened breach of _Article V_
and that such actual or threatened breach by it may result in immediate,
irreparable and continuing injury to Purchaser and that a remedy at law for
any such actual or threatened breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, IR
agrees that Purchaser, in its sole discretion and in addition to any
other remedies it may have at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief or other equitable
relief, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, in case of any such
actual or threatened breach (without the necessity of actual injury being
proved).

  

ARTICLE VI ** _  Term_**

continue in full force for so long as Purchaser, or any future holder of the
Licensed IP Rights, retains any rights in any of the Licensed IP Rights.

  

6.2. In the event that either Party becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or makes
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver is appointed for
it, or it otherwise takes advantage of any insolvency law, the other Party
may terminate this Agreement upon one (1) days written notice.

  

6.3. All licenses granted under this Agreement shall be deemed licenses of
"intellectual property rights" as defined in Section 365(n) of Title IX, U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, and each such license shall be governed by Section 365(n) in
the event that Purchaser seeks or is

     

   



  

involuntarily placed under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code. In such
event, IR shall have the further option to elect termination of this
Agreement but retain all rights under the licenses granted in Section 2.1 to
support its then-existing customers and sublicensees; to dispose, in any
manner, of all products and inventory related thereto; and to properly
discharge any and all of IRs third party obligations incurred prior to the
termination.

  

ARTICLE VII ** _  General Limitations_**

  

7.1. The obligations and rights of the Parties under this Agreement shall be

WHEREAS, IR owns and makes commercial use of the Licensed Marks (as
hereinafter defined) and has registrations for certain Licensed Marks in
certain countries;

  

WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to use the Licensed Marks in connection with
Licensed Products (as hereinafter defined); and

  

WHEREAS, IR is willing to grant a license to Purchaser to use, and permit
Purchasers use of, the Licensed Marks in connection with Licensed Products
under the terms and conditions set forth herein;

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth in this Trademark Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, including, without limitation the valuable consideration set
forth in the MPA, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

     

   



  

ARTICLE 1 _ Definitions_

  

1.1. "Affiliate" means any person that, directly or indirectly through one or
more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by or is under common control
with the person specified. For purposes of this definition, control of
a person means the power, direct or indirect, to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such person, whether by contract
or otherwise.

  

1.2. "Common Law Marks" shall mean the marks "HALF-PAK", "MICRO3",

1.3. "Licensed Marks" **** means the registered marks and the part numbers
with IR or IRF prefixes listed on _Schedule A_ , attached hereto and made a
part hereof. Licensed Marks excludes all marks licensed to Purchaser pursuant
to that certain IR Trademark Agreement, executed concurrently with this
Trademark Agreement on the Effective Date.

  

1.4. "Licensed Products" means all products sold in connection with the
Licensed Marks and (i) identified on _Schedule B_ , attached hereto and made
a part hereof, or (ii) constituting subsequent versions of the products
identified on _Schedule B_ that do not include any materially additional or

ARTICLE 2 _  License Grant_

  

2.1. IR hereby grants to Purchaser a world-wide, non-transferable (subject to

its Affiliates,

     

   



  

non-exclusive license, to use the Licensed Marks on and in connection with
the Licensed Products during the term hereof, _provided_ that the Licensed
Products are manufactured and sold in accordance with the Standards
of Quality. Nothing in this Trademark Agreement shall be construed to grant
Purchaser the right to use the Licensed Marks on or in connection with any

2.2. IR shall not itself use, and shall not license or permit any Affiliate
or third Person to use, the part numbers included in the Licensed Marks.

ARTICLE 3 _  Examination of Products_

  

3.1. IR has the right to conduct a reasonable review of Purchasers use of
the Licensed Marks with respect to the nature and quality of the Licensed
Products sold pursuant to this Trademark Agreement.

  

3.2. IR, or its authorized representative, shall have the right at any
reasonable time during regular business hours, twice per calendar year, on
reasonable notice, to visit the plants and facilities of Purchaser and its
suppliers where Licensed Products are manufactured, assembled, packaged,
marketed, promoted, sold or serviced. IR may conduct an inspection and
examination of such portions of such plants and facilities as pertain to the
manufacturing, assembly, packaging, marketing, promoting, sale or service of
Licensed Products. Purchaser agrees to furnish IR, from time to time as
reasonably requested by IR and at IRs expense, representative samples of all
Licensed Products, and representative samples showing all other uses of the
Licensed Marks by Purchaser in connection with the Licensed Products. If, at
any time, Licensed Products sold in connection with the Licensed Marks fail
to meet the Standards

     

   



  

Of Quality or any requirement expressly set forth in this Trademark Agreement
and IR notifies Purchaser of such failure in writing explaining
the particular standard not met, Purchaser shall take reasonable steps to
bring the Licensed Products into conformance or obtain consent from IR to
continue such non-conformance. If Purchaser fails to cure such defects or
obtain such consent within two (2) months of receiving IRs written notice of
nonconformity, then Purchaser shall promptly cease the manufacturing,
assembly, packaging, marketing, promoting, and sale of non-conforming
Licensed Products bearing the Licensed Marks until conformance is achieved.

  

ARTICLE 4 _  Use of the Licensed Marks_

  

4.1. Under the license granted in Article 2 hereof, Purchaser is authorized
to use the Licensed Marks on or in connection with Licensed Products,
including use in its packaging, labeling, publicity, advertising, instruction
books and other literature for or relating to the Licensed Products. In no
event, however, shall Purchaser use the Licensed Marks as part of a trade
name or authorize another Person to do so.

  

4.2. Purchaser shall comply with reasonable rules and practices for trademark
usage set forth from time to time by IR with respect to the appearance and
manner of use of the Licensed Marks that IR is then using **,**
including such rules and practices set forth in any existing IR trademark
usage manuals or policy statements, as identified in _Schedule C_. In using
the Licensed Marks, Purchaser shall indicate that the registered Licensed
Marks are trademarks of IR.

  

4.3. Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
pertaining to the use of the Licensed Marks, including those pertaining to
the proper use and designation of trademarks, corporate names and trade
names.

  

4.4. Purchaser agrees to comply with all guidelines set forth in _Schedule C_
, and all reasonable revisions thereto from time to time, for the purpose of
distinguishing the Licensed Marks and preventing confusion of itself with any
third Person.

  

4.5. If, in the discretion of IR, it is required or advisable for the purpose
of implementing or enforcing this Trademark Agreement, or for the purpose of
maintaining, enhancing, or protecting IRs rights in the Licensed Marks, to
record or enter this Trademark

     

   



  

Agreement with a Governmental Authority, IR will attend to such recording or
entry at its own expense.  At IRs expense, Purchaser will execute and
deliver to IR such additional instruments or documentation as IR may
reasonably request to effectuate such recording or entry, including without
limitation execution and delivery of substitute or short-form license
agreements, with terms consistent with this Trademark Agreement, for
recordation or registration in specified countries in the event that this
Trademark Agreement shall be deemed to be unsuitable for recordation or entry
in such countries. The terms and conditions of this Trademark Agreement (and
not the terms and conditions of such substitute or short-form license
agreements entered into for recording or entry purposes) shall be binding
between the Parties throughout the world and shall govern and control any
controversy that may arise with respect to each Partys rights
and obligations hereunder.

  

4.6. Purchaser shall supply IR with such information concerning Licensed
Products as IR may reasonably request at IRs expense to aid IR in the
acquisition, maintenance, and renewal of registrations of the Licensed Marks,
to record this Trademark Agreement and to enter Purchaser as a registered or
authorized user of the Licensed Marks with a Governmental Authority.

  

ARTICLE 5 _  Ownership and Validity of Licensed Marks_

  

5.1. Purchaser acknowledges IRs ownership of the Licensed Marks and agrees
that any and all rights in the Licensed Marks that might be acquired by the
use of the Licensed Marks by Purchaser shall inure to the sole benefit of IR.
If Purchaser obtains rights in or to the Licensed Marks, Purchaser shall
transfer those rights back to IR upon its request at no charge. For purposes
of this Trademark Agreement only, IR agrees that Purchasers use of the IR
part numbers without the IR or IRF preface (e.g. use of 1234 for an existing
IR part number IR1234) does not requires a trademark license from IR.

  

5.2. Purchaser further agrees not to use or register in any country any
trademarks, trade names or internet domain names confusingly similar to the
Licensed Marks. Whenever the attention of Purchaser is called by IR to any
such risk of confusion, Purchaser agrees to take appropriate
steps immediately to remedy or avoid such risk of confusion.

     

   



  

5.3. Purchaser shall give IR notice of any known infringements of the
Licensed Marks by others, and Purchaser shall render IR reasonable
cooperation for the protection of the Licensed Marks at IRs expense. IR
shall retain all rights to bring all actions and proceedings in connection
with infringement or unauthorized use of the Licensed Marks at its
sole discretion. If IR decides to enforce its rights in or to the Licensed
Marks against an infringer, all costs incurred and recoveries made shall be
the responsibility of and for the account of IR.

  

5.4. Purchaser will not, directly or indirectly, do or cause to be done any
act or thing disputing, attacking, impairing, or diluting IRs right, title
or interest in or to the Licensed Marks. For purposes of this
Trademark Agreement only, IR agrees that Purchasers use of the Vishay house
mark or logo or the Siliconix house mark or logo in conjunction with the IR
part numbers included in the Licensed Marks without the IR preface does not
impair or dilute IRs right, title, or interest in or to the Licensed Marks.

  

ARTICLE 6 _  Term and Termination_

  

6.1. The term of this Trademark Agreement shall commence on the Effective
Date and, unless terminated sooner in accordance with this Article, shall
expire two (2) years thereafter.

  

6.2. This Trademark Agreement shall be subject to termination by IR upon
written notice to Purchaser in the event that, in IRs reasonable judgment:

  

6.2.1 Such termination is necessary to comply with any order, decree or
request of any court of competent jurisdiction or any competent governmental
authority or any department or agency thereof; or

  

6.2.2 The normal conduct of the business of Purchaser as an ongoing
enterprise ceases or is substantially altered as a consequence of any action
taken by any governmental, judicial, or other authority; or

  

6.2.3 Purchaser materially breaches its obligations under this Trademark
Agreement and the material breach is not corrected within forty-five (45)
days after written notice from IR specifying the nature of such material
breach.

     

   



  

6.3. In the event that either Party becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or makes
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver is appointed for
it, or it otherwise takes advantage of any insolvency law, the other Party
may terminate this Trademark Agreement upon one (1) days written notice.

  

6.4. Upon the termination of this Trademark Agreement, Purchaser agrees to
cease and discontinue, promptly and completely, further use of the Licensed
Marks.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that termination
occurs under Sections 6.1 or 6.3, Purchaser shall have a period of ninety
(90) days from the date of such termination to use up its supplies of
Licensed Products, literature, packaging and other materials to which the
Licensed Marks already have been applied prior to the date of termination;
_provided_ that such terminal use of the Licensed Marks shall otherwise be in
accordance with the provisions of this Trademark Agreement.

  

6.5. Expiration or termination of this Trademark Agreement shall not relieve
either Party of any liability or obligations accruing as of the effective
date of such expiration or termination.

  

6.6. The provisions of Sections 5.1, 5.4, 8.1, 8.10 and 8.11 shall survive
termination of this Trademark Agreement.

7.1. IR represents and warrants that the Licensed Marks are owned by IR.  IR
has good and valid title to Licensed Marks.

granted under this Trademark Agreement is or will be free from infringement
of any trademarks or tradenames of third persons; or (iii) conferring a right

ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SHOULD HAVE FORESEEN
SUCH DAMAGES.

  

ARTICLE 8 _  Miscellaneous_

Rectifier Corporation, a company organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware ("IR"), and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., a company organized under
the laws of Delaware ("Purchaser"). IR and Purchaser each may be referred to
herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

  

WHEREAS, the Parties have entered into that certain Master Purchase
Agreement, dated as of , 2006, pursuant to which IR
has agreed to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser has agreed to purchase from IR
the capital stock or other equity interests of certain subsidiary

WHEREAS, IR owns and makes commercial use of the Licensed Marks (as
hereinafter defined) and has registrations for certain Licensed Marks in
certain countries;

  

WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to use the Licensed Marks in connection with
Licensed Products (as hereinafter defined); and

  

WHEREAS, IR is willing to grant a license to Purchaser to use, and permit
Purchasers use of, the Licensed Marks in connection with Licensed Products,
under the terms and conditions set forth herein;

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth in this IR Trademark Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, including, without limitation the valuable consideration set
forth in the MPA, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

     

   



  

ARTICLE 1 _ Definitions_

  

1.1. "Affiliate" means any person that, directly or indirectly through one or
more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by or is under common control
with the person specified. For purposes of this definition, control of
a person means the power, direct or indirect, to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such person, whether by contract
or otherwise.

  

1.2. "Licensed Marks" **** means the marks listed on _Schedule A_ , attached
hereto and made a part hereof.

  

1.3. "Licensed Products" means all products sold in connection with the
Licensed Marks and (i) identified on _Schedule B_ , attached hereto and made
a part hereof, or (ii) constituting subsequent versions of the products
identified on _Schedule B_ that do not include any additional or different
form or functionality.

  

1.4. "Standards of Quality" means the general standards of design, material
and workmanship heretofore observed by IR in its manufacture and sale of
products identical or similar to the Licensed Products.

  

1.5. All other capitalized terms not defined herein shall be defined as set
forth in the MPA.

  

ARTICLE 2 _  License Grant_

  

2.1. IR hereby grants to Purchaser a world-wide, non-transferable (subject to
Section 8.6 hereof), non-sublicensable, except for the right to sublicense to
its Affiliates, non-exclusive limited license, to use the Licensed Marks on
and in connection with the Licensed Products during the term hereof, for the
following purposes only: (i) to market and sell Licensed Products
manufactured by Purchaser and/or IR; and (ii) to distribute documents for or
relating to the Licensed Products (e.g., packaging, labeling, instruction
books, and product literature. The aforementioned limited license is granted,
_provided_ that the Licensed Products are manufactured and sold in accordance
with the Standards of Quality.  Nothing in this IR Trademark Agreement shall
be construed to grant Purchaser the right to use the Licensed Marks on or in
connection with any products other than the Licensed Products as set forth
herein.

     

   



  

2.2. IR covenants not to sue Purchaser or its sublicensees for use of the
Licensed Marks to show the legacy of the Licensed Products (e.g. "formerly
sold as IR part No. IRF1234").

  

ARTICLE 3 _  Examination of Products_

  

3.1. IR has the right to conduct a reasonable review of Purchasers use of
the Licensed Marks with respect to the nature and quality of the Licensed
Products sold pursuant to this IR Trademark Agreement.

  

3.2. IR, or its authorized representative, shall have the right at any
reasonable time during regular business hours, on reasonable notice, to visit
the plants and facilities of Purchaser and its suppliers where Licensed
Products are manufactured, assembled, packaged, marketed, promoted, sold or
serviced.  IR may conduct an inspection and examination of such portions of
such plants and facilities as pertain to the manufacturing, assembly,
packaging, marketing, promoting, sale or service of Licensed Products.
Purchaser agrees to furnish IR, from time to time as reasonably requested by
IR and at IRs expense, representative samples of all Licensed Products, and
representative samples showing all other uses of the Licensed Marks by
Purchaser in connection with the Licensed Products. If, at any time, Licensed
Products sold in connection with the Licensed Marks fail to meet the
Standards Of Quality or any requirement expressly set forth in this IR
Trademark Agreement and IR notifies Purchaser of such failure in writing
explaining the particular standard not met, Purchaser shall immediately take
appropriate steps to bring the Licensed Products into conformance or obtain
consent from IR to continue such non-conformance. If Purchaser fails to cure
such defects or obtain such consent within fifteen (15) days of
receiving IRs written notice of nonconformity, then Purchaser shall promptly
cease the manufacturing, assembly, packaging, marketing, promoting, and sale
of non-conforming Licensed Products bearing the Licensed Marks until
conformance is achieved.

  

ARTICLE 4 _  Use of the Licensed Marks_

  

4.1. In no event shall Purchaser use the Licensed Marks as part of a trade
name or authorize another Person to do so.

     

   



  

4.2. Purchaser shall comply with reasonable rules and practices for trademark
usage set forth from time to time by IR with respect to the appearance and
manner of use of the Licensed Marks that IR is then using **,**
including such rules and practices set forth in any existing IR trademark
usage manuals or policy statements as identified in _Schedule C_. In using
the Licensed Marks, Purchaser shall indicate that the Licensed Marks are
trademarks of IR.

  

4.3. Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
pertaining to the use of the Licensed Marks, including those pertaining to
the proper use and designation of trademarks, corporate names and trade
names.

  

4.4. Purchaser agrees to comply with all guidelines set forth in _Schedule C_
, and all reasonable revisions thereto from time to time, for the purpose of
distinguishing the Licensed Marks and preventing confusion of itself with any
third Person.

  

4.5. If, in the discretion of IR, it is required or advisable for the purpose
of implementing or enforcing this IR Trademark Agreement, or for the purpose
of maintaining, enhancing, or protecting IRs rights in the Licensed Marks,
to record or enter this IR Trademark Agreement with a Governmental Authority,
IR will attend to such recording or entry at its own expense.  At IRs
expense, Purchaser will execute and deliver to IR such additional instruments
or documentation as IR may reasonably request to effectuate such recording or
entry, including without limitation execution and delivery of substitute or
short-form license agreements, with terms consistent with this IR Trademark
Agreement, for recordation or registration in specified countries in the
event that this IR Trademark Agreement shall be deemed to be unsuitable for
recordation or entry in such countries. The terms and conditions of this IR
Trademark Agreement (and not the terms and conditions of such substitute or
short-form license agreements entered into for recording or entry purposes)
shall be binding between the Parties throughout the world and shall govern
and control any controversy that may arise with respect to each Partys
rights and obligations hereunder.

  

4.6. Purchaser shall supply IR with such information concerning Licensed
Products as IR may reasonably request at IRs expense to aid IR in the
acquisition, maintenance, and renewal of registrations of the Licensed Marks,
to record this IR Trademark Agreement and

     

   



  

to enter Purchaser as a registered or authorized user of the Licensed Marks
with a Governmental Authority.

  

ARTICLE 5 _  Ownership and Validity of Licensed Marks_

  

5.1. Purchaser acknowledges IRs ownership of the Licensed Marks, and agrees
that any and all rights in the Licensed Marks that might be acquired by the
use of the Licensed Marks by Purchaser shall inure to the sole benefit of IR.
If Purchaser obtains rights in or to the Licensed Marks, Purchaser shall
transfer those rights back to IR upon its request at no charge. For purposes
of this IR Trademark Agreement only, IR agrees that Purchasers use of the IR
part numbers without the IR or IRF preface (e.g. use of 1234 for an existing
IR part number IR1234) does not requires a trademark license from IR.

  

5.2. Purchaser further agrees not to use or register in any country any
trademarks, trade names or internet domain names confusingly similar to the
Licensed Marks. Whenever the attention of Purchaser is called by IR to any
such risk of confusion, Purchaser agrees to take appropriate
steps immediately to remedy or avoid such risk of confusion.

  

5.3. Purchaser shall give IR notice of any known infringements of the
Licensed Marks by others, and Purchaser shall render IR reasonable
cooperation for the protection of the Licensed Marks at IRs expense. IR
shall retain all rights to bring all actions and proceedings in connection
with infringement or unauthorized use of the Licensed Marks at its
sole discretion. If IR decides to enforce its rights in or to the Licensed
Marks against an infringer, all costs incurred and recoveries made shall be
the responsibility of and for the account of IR.

  

5.4. Purchaser will not, directly or indirectly, do or cause to be done any
act or thing disputing, attacking, impairing, or diluting IRs right, title
or interest in or to the Licensed Marks.

  

ARTICLE 6 _  Term and Termination_

  

6.1. The term of this IR Trademark Agreement shall commence on the Effective
Date and, unless terminated sooner in accordance with this Article, shall
expire twelve (12) months thereafter.

     

   



  

6.2. This IR Trademark Agreement shall be subject to termination by IR upon
written notice to Purchaser in the event that, in IRs reasonable judgment:

request of any court of competent jurisdiction or any competent governmental
authority or any department or agency thereof; or

  

6.2.2 The normal conduct of the business of Purchaser as an ongoing
enterprise ceases or is substantially altered as a consequence of any action
taken by any governmental, judicial, or other authority; or

  

6.2.3 Purchaser materially breaches its obligations under this IR Trademark
Agreement and the material breach is not corrected within forty-five (45)
days after written notice from IR specifying the nature of such material
breach.

  

6.3. In the event that either Party becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or makes
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver is appointed for
it, or it otherwise takes advantage of any insolvency law, the other Party
may terminate this IR Trademark Agreement upon one (1) days written notice.

  

6.4. Upon the termination of this IR Trademark Agreement, Purchaser agrees to
cease and discontinue, promptly and completely, further use of the Licensed
Marks.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that termination
occurs under Sections 6.1 or 6.3, Purchaser shall have a period of thirty
(30) days from the date of such termination to use up its supplies of
Licensed Products to which the Licensed Marks already have been applied prior
to the date of termination; _provided_ that such terminal use of the Licensed
Marks shall otherwise be strictly in accordance with the provisions of this
IR Trademark Agreement

  

6.5. Expiration or termination of this IR Trademark Agreement shall not
relieve either Party of any liability or obligations accruing as of the
effective date of such expiration or termination.

  

6.6. The provisions of Sections 5.1, 5.4, 8.1, 8.10 and 8.11 shall survive
termination of this IR Trademark Agreement.

has good and valid title to Licensed Marks.

the validity or scope of any Licensed Marks; (ii) a warranty or
representation by IR that any use of the Licensed Marks under any license
granted under this IR Trademark Agreement is or will be free from
infringement of any trademarks or tradenames of third persons; or (iii)

conditions contained herein.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I  Services

  

1.1. _General_. In accordance with the provisions hereof, IR shall provide to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from IR, the services described in
Schedule A, and Schedule A-1, each attached hereto and made a part hereof
(each a "Service" and collectively, the "Services"). In addition to a
description of each Service, Schedules A and A-1 shall set forth, where
relevant, the maximum level or amount of each Service, applicable performance
times and the pricing parameters for each Service. Schedules A and A-1 may
be amended from time to time by written agreement of the Parties.

     

   



  

1.2. _Quality of Services_. Subject to Section 1.3, IR shall perform each of
the Services (i) in a workmanlike and professional manner, (ii) with the same
degree of care as it exercises in performing its own functions of a like or
similar nature, (iii) utilizing individuals of suitable experience,
training and skill, and (iv) in a timely manner in accordance with the
provisions of this Services Agreement.

  

1.3. _Forecasts_. Purchaser shall provide IR with a monthly forecast of its
requested level of Services.  The Service levels initially requested by
Purchaser (the "Initial Service Levels") shall be as set forth on Schedule A.
Service levels shall not be increased from the Initial Service Levels.
Service levels may be decreased from the Initial Service Levels upon
Purchasers delivery to IR of written notice of such decrease specified in
reasonable detail at least 30 days in advance of the month to which the
decrease forecast relates.  Once decreased Service levels may not be
subsequently increased.

  

1.4. _Responsible Personnel_. IR shall (i) from time to time designate
a senior level manager at IR who shall have overall responsibility for
IRs provision of Services hereunder and (ii) upon reasonable request of

Services and other matters specified in the Schedules.

  

1.6. _Recovery Procedures_. IR shall maintain, consistent with
past practices, operational recovery procedures to insure the availability
of systems and the integrity of data relating to the Services at all times.
In the event of the unavailability of any such system or the loss or
destruction of any such data, IR shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, consistent with past practices, to restore such systems and recover
or replace such data as quickly and completely as is practicable.

     

   



  

1.7. _Monitoring and Reports; Books and Records_. IR shall maintain books
and records in reasonable and customary detail pertaining to the provision of
Services pursuant to this Services Agreement. IR shall make such books and
records available for inspection by Purchaser or its authorized
representatives during normal business hours upon reasonable notice to IR.

  

ARTICLE 2  Compensation; Billing

  

2.1. _Service Fees_. In consideration of providing the Services, IR will
charge Purchaser the monthly fees indicated opposite each Service listed on
Schedules A and A-1 (each, a "Service Fee" and collectively, the
"Service Fees"). In the event that for any month there shall be an increase
or decrease of the level of any Service by 5% or more compared to the Initial
Service Levels, the Service Fee for the particular Service shall be adjusted
proportionately.

  

2.2. _Expenses_. IR shall also be entitled to charge Purchaser for its
documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses, of the kinds set forth
on Schedules A and A-1, incurred by IR in providing the Services
("Expenses").

  

2.3. _Invoices_. Not later than 30 days after the end of each calendar month,
IR shall send Purchaser an invoice that includes in reasonable detail the
Service Fees and Expenses due for Services provided to Purchaser for such
month. Payments of invoices shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available United States funds to one or more accounts specified in writing by
IR.  Payment shall be made within 30 days after the date of receipt of
IRs invoice. All amounts payable to IR hereunder shall be paid without
setoff, deduction, abatement or counterclaim.

  

2.4. _Payment Delay_. In the event that Purchaser fails to make any payment
of an invoice when due, IR shall have the right, at its sole option, upon 10
business days written notice (a "Suspension Notice"), to suspend performance
of the Services until payment has been received. IR may terminate this
Services Agreement in accordance with Article 11 in the event an invoice is
not paid within 30 days of Purchasers receipt of a Suspension Notice.

  

2.5. _Finance Charges_. With respect to the unpaid amount of any invoice not
paid in full within 30 days of receipt, a finance charge of 1% per month,
payable from the date of

     

   



  

the invoice to the date payment is received, shall be due and payable to IR.
In addition, Purchaser shall indemnify IR for its costs, including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred to collect any unpaid amount.

  

ARTICLE 3  Cooperation

  

3.1. _General_. Each Party shall cooperate with and provide assistance to the
other Party in carrying out the provisions of this Services Agreement.

  

3.2. _Transition_. At the request of Purchaser in contemplation of the
termination of any Services hereunder, in whole or in part, IR shall
cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchasers expense, in transitioning such
Services to Purchaser or any third-party service provider designated by
Purchaser.

  

ARTICLE 4  Confidentiality

  

4.1. _Generally_. In the course of the performance of the Services, each
Party may become aware of confidential and proprietary information of
the other Party ("Confidential Information").  All Confidential Information
disclosed by a Party during the term of this Services Agreement shall remain
the property of the disclosing Party and shall be used by the receiving Party
only in accordance with the provisions of this Services Agreement.

  

4.2. _Identification; Term_. (a) Except in the case of (x) information that
is subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 12.4 of the
Master Purchase Agreement or (y) information exchanged in furtherance of
the performance of the Services hereunder that is of a type that is
generally regarded by the Parties to be confidential information (such as
pricing, customer and production information), to which this subsection (a)
shall not apply, if disclosed in written form, Confidential Information shall
be identified as Confidential Information by an appropriate legend. If
disclosed orally or visually, it shall be identified as Confidential
Information at the time of disclosure and shall be confirmed by written
outline mailed to the other Party by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, within 30 days of the original disclosure. For a period of
7 years from the date of first receipt thereof, the receiving Party shall (i)
treat all such information in the same manner as it treats its own
confidential information, in any event exercising reasonable precautions to
prevent the disclosure of such information to

     

   



  

others; (ii) use such information only for the purposes set forth herein; and
(iii) disclose such information only to its employees who have a need to know
such information in the performance of their duties hereunder.

  

4.3. _Exceptions_. The obligations of confidential treatment under this
Article 4 shall not apply to any Confidential Information which (i) is or
becomes publicly known through no wrongful act, fault or negligence of the
receiving Party; (ii) was known by the receiving Party prior to disclosure or
is developed by the receiving Party independently of such disclosure
(and whose disclosure would not constitute a violation of the
confidentiality provisions of the Master Purchase Agreement); (iii) was
disclosed to the receiving Party by a third party who was not under any
obligation of confidentiality; (iv) is approved for release by written
authorization of the disclosing Party; or (v) is disclosed pursuant to a
requirement of law or by court order, provided that the receiving Party has
provided the disclosing Party with reasonable opportunity to prevent or limit
such legally required disclosure.

  

4.4. _Injunctive Relief_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it would be
difficult to measure the damages that might result from any actual
or threatened breach of this Article 4 and that such actual or threatened
breach by it may result in immediate, irreparable and continuing injury to
the other Party and that a remedy at law for any such actual or threatened
breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties agree that the non-
breaching Party, in its sole discretion and in addition to any other remedies
it may have at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief or other equitable relief, issued
by a court of competent jurisdiction, in case of any such actual or
threatened breach (without the necessity of actual injury being proved).

  

ARTICLE 5  Intellectual Property.

  

5.1. _Purchaser Intellectual Property_. Subject to the applicable provisions
of the Technology License Back Agreement dated as of the date hereof between
IR and Purchaser, all data, software, or other property or assets owned or
created by Purchaser shall remain the sole and exclusive property and
responsibility of Purchaser.  IR shall not acquire any rights in any such
data, software or other property or assets pursuant to this Services
Agreement.

     

   



  

5.2. _IR Intellectual Property_. Subject to the Technology License
Agreement, all data, software or other property or assets which are owned by
IR, including without limitation derivative works thereof and new data or
software created by IR at IRs expense pursuant to the provision of Services
and all intellectual property rights therein (the "IR Property"), shall be
the sole and exclusive property and responsibility of IR.  Purchaser shall
not acquire any rights in any IR Property pursuant to this Services
Agreement.

  

ARTICLE 6  Remedies and Limitation of Liability

  

6.1. In the event that any Service performed by IR hereunder is not performed
in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Purchasers sole remedy shall
be, at the election of Purchaser either (i) to require IR to re-perform such
Service in accordance with Article 1 without obligation on the part of
Purchaser to make payment for such performance or (ii) to provide Purchaser
with a credit in an equivalent amount towards the future purchase
of Services, as contemplated by this Services Agreement, and IR shall not be
liable for any other loss or damage on account of the performance of any
Service.

  

6.2. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, WITH REGARD TO ANY AND ALL CAUSES OF ACTION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS SERVICES AGREEMENT, THE LIABILITY OF A
PARTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO
THE OTHER FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS SERVICES

RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES IS BASED UPON BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT,
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
THEREOF.

  

6.3. In no event, whether as a result of breach of contract, indemnity,
warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall
either Partys liability to the other Party for any loss or damage arising
out of, or resulting from, this Services Agreement or the

     

   



  

furnishing of Services hereunder, exceed three times the monthly price of the
specific Service which gives rise to the claim.

extent, but only to the extent, that any such claims, liabilities, damages or
expenses are the result of a breach of this Services Agreement, gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the indemnified Party.

  

7.2. _Special Purchaser Indemnity_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold IR harmless from and
against (i) any tax, penalty, interest, addition to tax, tax surcharge, or
other charge payable by IR as a result of any sales, use or excise taxes
levied or based on amounts payable pursuant to this Services Agreement,
including privilege or excise taxes based on gross revenues under this
Agreement or taxes on the Services rendered to Purchaser, provided that
Purchaser shall not be responsible for any taxes levied measured by or based
upon the net income of IR; (ii) claims, liabilities, damages and expenses
arising out of or relating to (a) the content of or defects in any inventory,

upon reasonable action to minimize the impact of such event on the Parties.

disagrees with IRs Copper Change, it may elect (upon reasonable written
notice and timing to meet operational needs) to provide consigned copper
leadframe materials for IRs use in providing its Services; provided however,
any such materials must be qualified to and otherwise meet the specifications
for the particular Service being provided. Any such consigned
materials shall be subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.5 hereunder.

     

   



  

(c) In addition to any adjustments under Section 3(b), the then applicable
Service Fee for all Services provided hereunder shall be adjusted on the two
year anniversary of this Agreement ("Anniversary Adjustment Date") on the
basis of the change (increase or decrease) in IRs costs applicable to the
Services to the extent necessary to reflect IRs fair market value for the
cost of labor, overhead, utilities, supply gases, materials and allocations
(with allocations being on a similar basis as the allocations used to
establish the business forecast for the PCS business prepared in connection
with sale to Purchaser). IR shall provide a breakdown of such adjustment
upon written request from Purchaser (including upon reasonable request copies
of background supplier documents to verify material costs). IR shall provide
Purchaser with not less than 30 days advance notice of the proposed changes
in the Service Fees ("Changes") pursuant to this Section (c), including the
basis for such Changes in reasonable detail. If Purchaser disputes any of
the Changes, the Parties shall consult with each other and negotiate in good
faith in order to arrive at a mutually agreeable determination of the
appropriate Changes. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree upon

This Transition Buy Back Die Supply Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered
into and effective as of the day of [ ], [ ] (the

WHEREAS, IR and Supplier are parties to that certain Master Purchase
Agreement dated November 8, 2006 (the "Master Purchase Agreement"), pursuant
to which Supplier is purchasing from IR all of the capital stock of certain
IR subsidiaries and certain assets of IR and certain IR subsidiaries
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement; and

  

WHEREAS, Supplier agrees to provide, and IR desires to have Supplier provide,
certain of Suppliers die products on a transitional basis on the terms and
conditions contained herein.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE 1 
 Die Supply.

  

1.1. _General_. In accordance with the provisions hereof, Supplier shall sell
to IR, and IR shall purchase from Supplier, the types of die products set
forth on Exhibit A in whole wafer form (each a "Product" and collectively,
the "Products"). The Products shall be provided in accordance with the
applicable terms of this Agreement (including without limitation Exhibit A,
attached hereto and made a part hereof). Exhibit A may be amended from time
to time by written agreement of the Parties.

  

1.2. _Price_. For all Product deliveries made prior to the two year
anniversary of the Closing, the price for the Products shall be IRs
"standard cost" for such Products as determined as of the Closing ("Product
Standard Cost"), as set forth in Exhibit A. For all Product deliveries made
following the second anniversary of the Closing, the price for the Products
shall be the Product Standard Cost as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.1(b).

  

1.3. _Volume_. In each consecutive twelve month period following Closing
through the end of the term of this Agreement, Supplier shall be obligated to
supply only up to a maximum aggregate quantity of each type of Product set
forth in Exhibit A ("Aggregate Annual Quantity"), properly ordered in
accordance with the forecasting procedures set forth in Article 2. Within any
given calendar quarter, Supplier shall be obligated to supply up to 1/3 of
the Aggregate Annual Quantity for each Product type, subject to the Aggregate
Annual Quantity limitation and IR having properly ordered the quantity in
accordance with the forecasting procedures set forth in Article 2.

     

   



  

1.4. _Specifications_. The specifications for the Products shall be IRs
current product specifications.  Supplier shall produce the Products in
accordance with IRs current internal quality procedures in effect for the
facility at which the Products are produced.

  

1.5. _Wafer Testing_. IR shall be billed and pay for all Products passing

ARTICLE 2 
 Administrative Provisions.

  

2.1. _Forecast and Loading Procedures for Products_. (a) The forecast and
loading procedures for Products shall be as set forth in Schedule 1.

  

(b) Supplier shall use its good faith efforts to accommodate reasonable
changes timely requested by IR with respect to any Committed Forecast (as
defined in Schedule 1), but Supplier shall have no obligation to do so.
 Supplier shall otherwise be required to furnish Products in accordance with
each Committed Forecast furnished in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

  

(c) IR shall have the right to cancel without penalty any order whose
delivery is delayed by more than three weeks from the date of delivery
specified in the relevant Loading Schedule (as defined in Schedule 1),
provided that such delay is not attributable to any action or inaction of IR.
Such cancellation shall be without prejudice to any other rights that IR may
have under this Agreement or otherwise.

  

(d) IR shall provide such purchase order documents with respect to each
Committed Forecast and Loading Schedule as are reasonably requested by
Supplier to support its financial accounting and operational planning needs.
 The terms of this Agreement shall control in the event of any
conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order documents.

  

(e) Supplier shall provide notice to IR of scheduled maintenance of equipment
reasonably in advance of any Committed Forecast, so that IR can take account
of such scheduled maintenance in preparing its forecasts. In the event of
the need for any unscheduled equipment maintenance, Supplier shall
promptly so notify IR and shall take commercially reasonable action to
attempt to minimize disruption of production and otherwise conform production
as reasonably practicable under the circumstances to the Committed Forecasts.

  

2.2. _Quality Control and Certification_. The manufacturing systems and
protocols for the Products shall at all times qualify with TS 16949
certification. Supplier shall produce the Products in accordance with its
current internal quality procedures in effect for the facility at which the
Products are produced, COP 800, facility quality certification (TS 16949) and
customer quality requirements currently in effect with respect to the
Products and reasonable quality requirements of IRs customers as may arise
from time to time following the Effective Date ("Future Customer
Requirements") (provided that IR shall be responsible for any increased cost
arising from the Future Customer Requirements). Supplier will
communicate any change in the Products or their manufacture in accordance
with IRs Product Change Notification ("PCN") process; provided that if IR
reasonably believes that any such change would not be acceptable to a
customer, IR may elect pursuant to delivery of written notice thereof to
Supplier to have the

     

   



  

provisions of product discontinuation apply (Section 12.4 below) in which
case the PCN shall be deemed to be the Affected Products Notice and the
Products, without any such change, shall be the Affected Products.

  

2.3. _Shipping_. All Products shall have been deemed delivered upon tender of
the Product (Ex Works Suppliers applicable factory) at IRs request to an IR
inventory or "bank" location established for IR. IR shall be responsible, at

by Supplier pursuant to this Agreement. Supplier will cooperate with IR in
assembling and coordinating shipments, as reasonably requested by IR
consistent with the relevant Loading Schedule.

  

2.4. _Consultation_. At either Partys reasonable request, the Parties shall
meet and discuss the nature, quality, and quantity of Products contemplated
by this Agreement and any amendments a Party may wish to make to this
Agreement, including to the attached Exhibits and Schedules.

  

ARTICLE 3 
 Compensation; Billing

  

3.1. _Product Prices_.

Exhibit A (each, a "Purchase Price" and collectively, the "Purchase Prices"),
as otherwise adjusted hereunder.

  

(b) The then applicable Purchase Prices for all Products provided hereunder
shall be adjusted on the two year anniversary of this Agreement ("Anniversary
Adjustment Date") on the basis of the change (increase or decrease) in
Suppliers costs applicable to the Products to the extent necessary to
reflect Suppliers fair market value for the cost of labor, overhead,
utilities, supply gases, materials and allocations (with allocations being on
a similar basis as the allocations used to establish the business forecast
for the PCS Business (as defined in the Master Purchase Agreement) prepared
in connection with sale to Supplier). Supplier shall provide a breakdown of
such adjustment upon written request from IR (including upon reasonable
request copies of background supplier documents to verify material costs).
Supplier shall provide IR with not less than 30 days advance notice of the
proposed changes in the Purchase Prices ("Changes") pursuant to this Section
3.1(b), including the basis for such Changes in reasonable detail. If IR
disputes any of the Changes, the Parties shall consult with each other and
negotiate in good faith in order to arrive at a mutually agreeable
determination of the appropriate Changes. In the event that the Parties are
unable to agree upon the Changes by the Anniversary Adjustment Date, IR will
be obligated to make payments under this Agreement in accordance the Changes
as proposed by Supplier, without prejudice, however, to any contract or other
remedy available to IR for Suppliers failure to comply with the requirements
of this Agreement with respect to the Changes proposed by Supplier; provided
however, any claim of dispute with respect to Changes shall be filed within
60 days following the Anniversary Adjustment Date.

     

   



  

(c) Each Party shall be responsible for any bank charges that it incurs in
connection with the activities contemplated by this Agreement.

  

3.2. _Invoices_. Supplier shall send IR a weekly invoice that includes in
reasonable detail the Purchase Prices for Products provided to IR for the
week and any other amounts owing hereunder. Payments of invoices shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds to one or more
accounts specified in writing by Supplier.  Payment shall be made within 30
days after the date of IRs receipt of Suppliers invoice.

  

3.3. _Failure to Pay_. In the event that IR fails to make payment of an
invoice when due, Supplier shall have the right, at its sole option, upon
10 business days written notice (a "Suspension Notice") to suspend delivery
of the Products until payment has been received.  Supplier may terminate
this Agreement in accordance with Article 12 in the event an invoice is not
paid within 30 days of IRs receipt of a Suspension Notice.

  

3.4. _Late Payment Penalty_. With respect to the unpaid amount of any invoice
not paid in full within 30 days of receipt, a finance charge of 1% per month,
payable from the date of the invoice to the date payment is received, shall
be due and payable to Supplier. In addition, IR shall indemnify Supplier for
its costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred
to collect any unpaid amount.

  

ARTICLE 4 
 Cooperation

  

4.1. _Generally_. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with and provide
assistance to the other Party in carrying out the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

ARTICLE 5 
 Confidentiality

  

5.1. _Generally_. In the course of the supply of the Products, each Party may
become aware of confidential and proprietary information of the other Party
or of a third party in possession of such other Party
("Confidential Information"). All Confidential Information disclosed by a
Party during the term of this Agreement shall remain the property of the
disclosing Party and shall be used by the receiving Party only in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

  

5.2. _Identification; Term_. (a) Except in the case of (x) information that
is subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 12.4 of the Master
Purchase Agreement or (y) information exchanged in furtherance of the supply
of the Products hereunder that is of a type that is generally regarded by the
Parties to be confidential information (such as pricing, customer and
production information), to which this subsection (a) shall not apply, (i) if
disclosed in written form, Confidential Information shall be identified as
Confidential Information by an appropriate legend; and (ii) if disclosed
orally or visually, it shall be identified as Confidential Information at the
time of disclosure and shall be confirmed by written outline mailed to the
other Party by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, within
30 days of the original disclosure. (b) For a period of 7 years from the
date of first receipt thereof, the receiving Party shall (i) treat all
such information in the same manner as it treats its own confidential

     

   



  

information, in any event exercising reasonable precautions to prevent the
disclosure of such information to others; (ii) use such information only for
the purposes set forth herein; and (iii) disclose such information only to
its employees who have a need to know such information in the performance of
their duties hereunder.

  

5.3. _Exceptions_. The obligations of confidential treatment under this
Article 4 shall not apply to any Confidential Information which (i) is or
becomes publicly known through no wrongful act, fault or negligence of the
receiving Party; (ii) was known by the receiving Party prior to disclosure or
is developed by the receiving Party independently of such disclosure (and
whose disclosure would not constitute a violation of the confidentiality
provisions of the Master Purchase Agreement); (iii) was disclosed to the
receiving Party by a third party who was not under any obligation of
confidentiality; (iv) is approved for release by written authorization of the
disclosing Party; or (v) is disclosed pursuant to a requirement of law or by
court order, provided that the receiving Party has provided the disclosing
Party with reasonable opportunity to prevent or limit such legally required
disclosure.

  

5.4. _Injunctive Relief_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it would be
difficult to measure the damages that might result from any actual
or threatened breach of this Article 5 and that such actual or
threatened breach by it may result in immediate, irreparable and continuing
injury to the other Party and that a remedy at law for any such actual or
threatened breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties agree that the
non-breaching Party, in its sole discretion and in addition to any other
remedies it may have at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief or other equitable
relief, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, in case of any such
actual or threatened breach (without the necessity of actual injury being
proved).

this Agreement.

(ii) to provide IR with a credit in an equivalent amount towards future
Products, as contemplated by this Agreement. Die that is part of a Product

credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supplier shall be liable for
additional damages actually incurred by IR ("IR Damages") arising from
product liability claims brought by third parties up to an aggregate amount
of $2,000,000; provided however, that any and all IR Damages recoverable
hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of Article 10 of the Master

OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR
LOSS OF PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM
GIVING RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES IS BASED UPON BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF
CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE 1 
 Die Supply.

  

1.1. _General_. In accordance with the provisions hereof, IR shall sell to
the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase from IR, the types of die
products set forth on Exhibit A in whole wafer form (each a "Product" and
collectively, the "Products"). The Products shall be provided in accordance
with the applicable terms of this Agreement (including without limitation
Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof). Exhibit A may be amended
from time to time by written agreement of the Parties.

  

1.2. _Price_. For all Product deliveries made prior to the two year
anniversary of the Closing, the price for the Products shall be IRs

following the second anniversary of the Closing, the price for the Products
shall be the Product Standard Cost as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.1(b).

  

1.3. _Volume_. In each consecutive twelve month period following Closing
through the end of the term of this Agreement, IR shall be obligated to
supply only up to a maximum aggregate quantity of each type of Product set
forth in Exhibit A ("Aggregate Annual Quantity"), properly ordered in

Aggregate Annual Quantity for each Product type, subject to the Aggregate
Annual Quantity limitation and

     

   



  

Purchaser having properly ordered the quantity in accordance with the
forecasting procedures set forth in Article 2.

  

1.4. _Specifications_. The specifications for the Products shall be IRs

with its current internal quality procedures in effect for the facility at
which the Products are produced.

  

1.5. _Restriction on Use_. Purchaser shall use the Products solely

passing IRs Maverick Product Elimination Program (HOP-500-17)
("Maverick Protocol").

  

ARTICLE 2 
 Administrative Provisions.

  

2.1. _Forecast and Loading Procedures for Products_. (a) The forecast and
loading procedures for Products shall be as set forth in Schedule 1.

  

(b) IR shall use its good faith efforts to accommodate reasonable changes
timely requested by Purchaser with respect to any Committed Forecast (as
defined in Schedule 1), but IR shall have no obligation to do so. IR
shall otherwise be required to furnish Products in accordance with each
Committed Forecast furnished in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

(c) Purchaser shall have the right to cancel without penalty any order whose
delivery is delayed by more than three weeks from the date of delivery
specified in the relevant Loading Schedule (as defined in Schedule 1),
provided that such delay is not attributable to any action or inaction of
Purchaser. Such cancellation shall be without prejudice to any other rights
that Purchaser may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

  

(d) Purchaser shall provide such purchase order documents with respect to
each Committed Forecast and Loading Schedule as are reasonably requested by
IR to support its financial accounting and operational planning needs.  The
terms of this Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict between
this Agreement and any purchase order documents.

  

(e) IR shall provide notice to Purchaser of scheduled maintenance of
equipment reasonably in advance of any Committed Forecast, so that Purchaser
can take account of such scheduled maintenance in preparing its forecasts.
 In the event of the need for any unscheduled equipment maintenance,
IR shall promptly so notify Purchaser and shall take commercially
reasonable action to attempt to minimize disruption of production and
otherwise conform production as reasonably practicable under the
circumstances to the Committed Forecasts.

  

2.2. _Quality Control and Certification_. The manufacturing systems and
protocols for the Products shall at all times qualify with TS 16949
certification. IR shall produce the Products in accordance with its current
internal quality procedures in effect for the facility at which the

     

   



  

Products are produced, COP 800, facility quality certification (TS 16949) and
customer quality requirements currently in effect with respect to the
Products and reasonable quality requirements of Purchasers customers as may
arise from time to time following the Effective Date ("Future Customer
Requirements") (provided that Purchaser shall be responsible for any
increased cost arising from the Future Customer Requirements). IR will
communicate any change in the Products or their manufacture in accordance
with IRs Product Change Notification ("PCN") process; provided that if
Purchaser reasonably believes that any such change would not be acceptable to
a customer, Purchaser may elect pursuant to delivery of written notice
thereof to IR to have the provisions of product discontinuation apply
(Section 12.4 below) in which case the PCN shall be deemed to be the Affected
Products Notice and the Products, without any such change, shall be the
Affected Products.

  

2.3. _Shipping_. All Products shall have been deemed delivered upon tender of
the Product (Ex Works IRs applicable factory) at Purchasers request to a
Purchaser inventory or "bank" location established for Purchaser. Purchaser

reasonably requested by Purchaser consistent with the relevant Loading
Schedule.

meet and discuss the nature, quality, and quantity of Products contemplated

"Purchase Prices"), as otherwise adjusted hereunder.

  

(b) The then applicable Purchase Prices for all Products provided hereunder
shall be adjusted on the two year anniversary of this Agreement ("Anniversary
Adjustment Date") on the basis of the change (increase or decrease) in IRs
costs applicable to the Products to the extent necessary to reflect IRs fair
market value for the cost of labor, overhead, utilities, supply gases,
materials and allocations (with allocations being on a similar basis as the
allocations used to establish the business forecast for the PCS Business (as
defined in the Master Purchase Agreement) prepared in connection with sale to
Purchaser). IR shall provide a breakdown of such adjustment upon written
request from Purchaser (including upon reasonable request copies of
background supplier documents to verify material costs). IR shall provide
Purchaser with not less than 30 days advance notice of the proposed changes
in the Purchase Prices ("Changes") pursuant to this Section 3.1(b), including
the basis for such Changes in reasonable detail. If Purchaser disputes any of
the Changes, the Parties shall consult with each other and negotiate in good
faith in order to arrive at a mutually agreeable determination of the

     

   



  

appropriate Changes.  In the event that the Parties are unable to agree upon
the Changes by the Anniversary Adjustment Date, Purchaser will be obligated
to make payments under this Agreement in accordance the Changes as proposed
by IR, without prejudice, however, to any contract or other remedy available
to Purchaser for IRs failure to comply with the requirements of this
Agreement with respect to the Changes proposed by IR; provided however, any
claim of dispute with respect to Changes shall be filed within 60 days
following the Anniversary Adjustment Date.

  

(c) Each Party shall be responsible for any bank charges that it incurs in
connection with the activities contemplated by this Agreement.

reasonable detail the Purchase Prices for Products provided to Purchaser for
the week and any other amounts owing hereunder. Payments of invoices shall be

more accounts specified in writing by IR. Payment shall be made within 30
days after the date of Purchasers receipt of IRs invoice.

  

3.3. _Failure to Pay_. In the event that Purchaser fails to make payment of
an invoice when due, IR shall have the right, at its sole option, upon 10
business days written notice (a "Suspension Notice") to suspend delivery of
the Products until payment has been received. IR may terminate this Agreement
in accordance with Article 12 in the event an invoice is not paid within 30
days of Purchasers receipt of a Suspension Notice.

  

3.4. _Late Payment Penalty_. With respect to the unpaid amount of any invoice
not paid in full within 30 days of receipt, a finance charge of 1% per month,
payable from the date of the invoice to the date payment is received, shall
be due and payable to IR. In addition, Purchaser shall indemnify IR for its
costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred to
collect any unpaid amount.

  

ARTICLE 4 
 Cooperation

  

4.1. _Generally_. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with and provide
assistance to the other Party in carrying out the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

ARTICLE 5 
 Confidentiality

  

5.1. _Generally_. In the course of the supply of the Products, each Party may
become aware of confidential and proprietary information of the other Party
or of a third party in possession of such other Party
("Confidential Information"). All Confidential Information disclosed by a
Party during the term of this Agreement shall remain the property of the
disclosing Party and shall be used by the receiving Party only in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

  

5.2. _Identification; Term_. (a) Except in the case of (x) information that
is subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 12.4 of the Master
Purchase Agreement or (y) information exchanged in furtherance of the supply
of the Products hereunder that is of a type

     

   



  

that is generally regarded by the Parties to be confidential information
(such as pricing, customer and production information), to which this
subsection (a) shall not apply, (i) if disclosed in written form,
Confidential Information shall be identified as Confidential Information by
an appropriate legend; and (ii) if disclosed orally or visually, it shall be
identified as Confidential Information at the time of disclosure and shall be
confirmed by written outline mailed to the other Party by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, within 30 days of the original
disclosure. (b) For a period of 7 years from the date of first receipt
thereof, the receiving Party shall (i) treat all such information in the same
manner as it treats its own confidential information, in any event exercising
reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure of such information to
others; (ii) use such information only for the purposes set forth herein; and
(iii) disclose such information only to its employees who have a need to know
such information in the performance of their duties hereunder.

  

5.3. _Exceptions_. The obligations of confidential treatment under this
Article 4 shall not apply to any Confidential Information which (i) is or
becomes publicly known through no wrongful act, fault or negligence of the
receiving Party; (ii) was known by the receiving Party prior to disclosure or

confidentiality; (iv) is approved for release by written authorization of the
disclosing Party; or (v) is disclosed pursuant to a requirement of law or by
court order, provided that the receiving Party has provided the disclosing
Party with reasonable opportunity to prevent or limit such legally required
disclosure.

  

5.4. _Injunctive Relief_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it would be
difficult to measure the damages that might result from any actual
or threatened breach of this Article 5 and that such actual or
threatened breach by it may result in immediate, irreparable and continuing
injury to the other Party and that a remedy at law for any such actual or
threatened breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties agree that the
non-breaching Party, in its sole discretion and in addition to any other
remedies it may have at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief or other equitable
relief, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, in case of any such
actual or threatened breach (without the necessity of actual injury being
proved).

pursuant to this Agreement.

payment for such re-supply or (ii) to provide Purchaser with a credit in an
equivalent amount towards future Products, as contemplated by this Agreement.

("Purchaser IGBT Auto Die Damages") arising from product liability claims
brought by third parties up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 (when taken
together with any Purchaser Damages as defined under the Transition Product

unreasonably withheld).

THE WARRANTY, ARE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED IN RESPECT OF ANY PRODUCTS PROVIDED
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  

7.3. _SPECIAL DAMAGES_. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT
MAY BE ALLOWABLE UNDER THE  PROVISIONS OF THE LAST SENTENCE OF SECTION 7.1
(AND SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS THEREIN), THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT, WITH REGARD TO ANY AND ALL CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR

 **Form of Indemnification Agreement**

  

 **INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AGREEMENT**

  

This Escrow Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into this day
of  , 2006, by and among by and among Vishay Intertechnology,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), International Rectifier
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "), and [ ], as
escrow agent hereunder (the " _Escrow Agent_ ").  Capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them
in the Master Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

  

 **RECITALS**

  

WHEREAS, Purchaser and Seller have entered into that certain Master Purchase
Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2006 (the " _Master Purchase Agreement_
"), which provides for, among other things, the sale by the Seller of all of
the Shares of the Companies and certain of the assets of Seller and the
Selling Subsidiaries, in each case related to, and primarily used in, the PCS
Business;

  

WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms of the Master Purchase Agreement,
$14,485,000 (together with any interest or other income earned thereon, the "
_Escrow Funds_ ") of the consideration otherwise payable to the Seller has
been paid to the Escrow Agent and is to be held by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Master Purchase
Agreement; and

  

WHEREAS, the parties desire that the Escrow Agent disburse amounts from the
Escrow Account (as defined in Section 3 below) to Seller or Purchaser from
time to time as provided below.

  

 **AGREEMENT**

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual obligations
and covenants set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration
(the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged), the parties
hereto agree as follows:

  

# **1. _Escrow Agent Appointment_. The Escrow Agent is hereby appointed to
act as escrow agent hereunder, to hold in escrow the Escrow Funds and to
direct the disposition thereof in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The
Escrow Agent represents and warrants to Purchaser and Seller that Escrow
Agent has all legal power and authority to act in the manner contemplated by
this Agreement and to perform its duties hereunder.**

  

# **2. _Receipt of Escrow Funds_. By its signature below, the Escrow
Agent hereby acknowledges its receipt by wire transfer of funds in the amount
of the Escrow Funds to a separate, segregated escrow account established by
the Escrow Agent and maintained by it at its office referred to in Section 10
below (the " _Escrow Account_ "). The Escrow Funds shall**

     

   



  

# **be held by the Escrow Agent for the benefit of Purchaser and Seller
pursuant to this Agreement.**

  

# **3. _Investment of Escrow Funds_. The Escrow Funds shall be invested by
the Escrow Agent, as directed pursuant to the written instructions of
Seller, solely in interest-bearing bank accounts or certificates of deposit.
Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that all payments made pursuant to this
Agreement from the Escrow Funds shall be subject to applicable withholding
laws or regulations then in force. If Purchaser provides the Escrow Agent with
a properly completed Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN, then, absent
a relevant change of law, the Escrow Agent shall not withhold any U.S. Taxes
with respect to any amounts paid to Purchaser under this Agreement or with
respect to any Escrow Interest (as defined below).  The Escrow Agent shall
report the amounts of all interest earned on the Escrow Fund and any other
income recognized for tax purposes with respect to the Escrow Fund
(collectively, the " _Escrow Interest_ ") during each calendar year (i) to
all applicable taxing authorities as the income of the Purchaser by January
31 of the succeeding calendar year and (ii) to the Purchaser and Seller
within ten (10) days of a written request for such information from either of
the Purchaser or Seller. The Purchaser shall report as its income for tax
purposes all amounts of Escrow Interest to the appropriate taxing
authorities and shall pay or cause to be paid all income taxes (if any) that
are due and payable by the Purchaser with respect to Escrow Interest (such
income taxes, the " _Escrow Taxes_ "). In connection with this payment of
Escrow Taxes, the Purchaser and Seller shall direct the Escrow Agent by joint
written instructions of Purchaser and Seller (" _Joint Instructions_ ") to
release to the Purchaser from time to time out of the Escrow Funds the amount
of the Escrow Taxes payable by the Purchaser so as to permit the timely
payment of Escrow Taxes by the Purchaser; ****_provided_** **, any Escrow
Taxes withheld by the Escrow Agent shall be treated as having been so
released to the Purchaser. The amount of Escrow Taxes shall be determined by
Purchaser, with Sellers consent (which Seller agrees not to unreasonably
withhold). In the event any portion of the Escrow Funds is to be paid over to
Seller pursuant to Section 4, then, at the time such payment out of the
Escrow Funds is required to be made, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an
amount equal to the product of (i) the aggregate amount of Escrow Taxes
released to the Purchaser multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of
which is the amount of such portion of the Escrow Funds to be so paid over to
Seller and (B) the denominator of which is the sum of $14,485,000
****_plus_** **the aggregate amount of Escrow Interest with respect to which
Escrow Taxes have been released to the Purchaser.**

  

# **4. _Disbursements from Escrow Account_.**

  

## ** _(a)_** ** _ _****_Escrow Agent shall continue to hold and safeguard
the Escrow Account until authorized hereunder to release the Escrow Funds and
Escrow Agent shall only release the Escrow Funds, or any portion thereof, as
follows:_**

  

(i) pursuant to the Joint Instructions at any time setting forth (A) the
amount of indemnification or distribution, which shall be disbursed from the
Escrow Account (to the extent of the then remaining balance thereof) and (B)
the recipients thereof; provided, that, notwithstanding such Joint
Instructions, the Escrow Agent shall report, and as required, except as
otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Agreement, withhold from any

     

   



  

payments or disbursements made pursuant to this Agreement from the Escrow
Funds any taxes as it determines may be required by any law or regulation
then in force;

  

(ii) as determined by the final order, decree or judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction in the United States of America (the time for appeal
having expired with no appeal having been taken) in a proceeding to which
Purchaser and the Seller are parties (a "Final Decree") upon receipt from
Purchaser or Seller of a certified copy of such Final Decree together with a
written notice (the " _Notice_ ") which Notice shall state that such Final
Decree is a final, non-appealable judgment or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction resolving the dispute as to the release of the applicable
portion of the Escrow Account, setting forth in reasonable detail the
substance of such judgment and instructions as to the resulting release
of the Escrow Account and certifying that a copy of such Notice has been
simultaneously delivered to the Seller (if Purchaser is delivering the
Notice) or Purchaser (if Seller is delivering the Notice) (such recipient,
the " _Non-Presenting Party_ "), in which case Escrow Agent shall release the
applicable portion of such Escrow Account according to such Notice on the
third (3rd) Business Day following receipt by Escrow Agent of the Notice;
provided, however, that if the Non-Presenting Party delivers to Escrow Agent
a certificate prior to such third (3rd) Business Day disputing the contents
of the Notice, then Escrow Agent shall not release the disputed portion of
the Escrow Account specified therein and shall interplead the disputed
portion of the Escrow Account specified therein into, or file a declaratory
judgment action with, a court of competent jurisdiction to determine the
rights of the parties to the dispute unless prior to such interpleader or
filing Escrow Agent receives joint written instructions from the Seller and
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 4(a)(i)_ hereof; or

  

(iii) within three (3) Business Days after the eighteenth (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Escrow Agent shall deliver to Seller the
balance of the Escrow Account, after deducting from the Escrow Account an
amount equal to the aggregate amounts set forth in then pending and
unresolved Claim Notices (copies of which shall be delivered by the Purchaser
to the Escrow Agent promptly following delivery thereof to the
Seller pursuant to the Master Purchase Agreement).

  

## ** _(b)_** ** _ _****_As promptly as practicable following any
disbursement of funds from the Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall send a
written statement to each of Purchaser and Seller stating the amount and
recipient of each such disbursement._**

  

## ** _(c)_** ** _ _****_Upon receipt of any Joint Instructions in
accordance with Section 4(a), the Escrow Agent shall, as soon as practicable
and in no event later than five Business Days after the receipt thereof,
disburse the amounts from the Escrow Account to Purchaser and/or Seller, as

(a) The Purchase Price and any other consideration for the Assets and Shares,

Treasury Regulation 1.1060-1(c) (the " _Tax Purchase Price_ "), shall be
allocated for such purposes as provided in United States Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.1060-1(c) and United States Treasury Regulations referred to
therein and pursuant to the procedures set forth herein. Purchaser and
Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) execute
and file all federal Income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with any
allocations agreed or determined pursuant hereto and shall not take any
position in any other Tax Return, before any Governmental Authority, or in
any Tax Proceeding that is inconsistent with any such allocation, except
pursuant to a final "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Law). Purchaser
and Sellers shall (and, if applicable, shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries, including the Companies, to) timely file any IRS Forms 8594 and
8883, as appropriate, and any other United States federal Income Tax Return
prepared in a manner consistent with the allocations agreed or determined
pursuant hereto and shall file any other Tax Return with any state, local or
foreign Governmental Authority in a manner that is not inconsistent
therewith. Any redetermination of the Tax Purchase Price within the meaning
of United States Treasury Regulations section 1.338-7 shall be made as
required thereby and shall be taken into account by Purchaser, Seller, and
their respective Subsidiaries in carrying out the provisions hereof and the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns referred to above to the
extent applicable.

  

(b) Subject to the foregoing and other provisions of this Tax Matters
Agreement (including the remainder of this Section 3), in connection with the
application of the provisions of United States Treasury Regulations sections
1.1060-1, 1.338-6 and 1.338-7, the Parties agree as follows: (i) the fair
market value of the Shares of each Company is the Purchase Price for such
Shares as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement for such Shares, and (ii)
the fair market value of Assets shall be as set forth on _Schedule 1_
hereto.

  

(c) [Intentionally omitted.]

  

(d) By written notice given no later than ninety (90) calendar days after the
Closing Date, either Seller or Purchaser may make a proposal to the other to
adjust the allocation of the Tax Purchase Price among the Shares and/or
Assets provided that such proposal is made in good faith and upon a
reasonable basis appropriately

     

   



  

substantiated by appraisal or valuation. Any proposed adjustment of the Tax
Purchase Price shall require the consent of both Seller and Purchaser.

  

(e) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement between
them regarding allocation of the Tax Purchase Price or other matter permitted
or required to be resolved by the Tax Arbitrator pursuant to this Tax Matters
Agreement (whether arising in connection with the procedures set forth herein
or thereafter in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or any Tax
Proceeding) within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery by either
Purchaser or Seller to the other of written notice of such disagreement, then
any of such disagreements may be submitted by either Purchaser or Seller for
final and binding resolution to the Neutral Accounting Firm to resolve such
disagreements. Upon receipt of any such submission, the Neutral Accounting
Firm shall designate a Tax partner at the Neutral Accounting Firm to resolve
the disagreements so submitted (the " _Tax Arbitrator_ "). Purchaser and
Seller shall instruct the Tax Arbitrator to choose either the resolution
proposed by Purchaser or the resolution proposed by Seller and to deliver to
Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any event within
ninety (90) calendar days after appointment of the Tax Arbitrator, a written
report setting forth the resolution of any such disagreement determined in
accordance herewith. The determination of the Tax Arbitrator shall be final
and binding upon Buyer and Seller.  The fees, expenses and costs of the Tax
Arbitrator shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by the party whose
position is rejected by the Tax Arbitrator.

  

(f) In the event that the allocation of Purchase Price has not been fully
agreed or determined pursuant hereto or a disagreement hereunder regarding a
Tax Return or Tax Proceeding remains unresolved at the time (taking into
account extensions, which the Purchaser, Seller, Company or Subsidiary shall
seek to the extent reasonably available) that Purchaser, Seller, a Company or
a Subsidiary of any of them is required to file a Tax Return that could
reasonably be affected by determination of the allocation of the Purchase
Price or resolution of such disagreement, then Purchaser and Seller shall
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, including the Companies, to)
allocate the Tax Purchase Price and otherwise file Tax Returns based upon
their respective good faith determinations and shall cause amendments to such
Tax Returns to be filed to the extent necessary to conform them to any
subsequent determination of the Tax Arbitrator or agreement of Purchaser and
Seller.

  

4. _Transfer and Withholding Taxes_.

  

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Any Taxes (other than Income Taxes) incurred as a
result of the sale of the Shares and Assets and other transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, including without limitation any documentary,
gross receipts, general excise, sales, use, stamp, registration or other
Taxes, shall be borne by the parties hereto as follows: (i) fifty
percent (50%) by the Seller and (ii) fifty percent (50%) by the Purchaser.

  

(b) _Withholding Taxes_. Purchaser shall provide Seller fifteen (15) days
advance notice of any requirement of applicable law or any demand that
Purchaser withhold any Taxes from interest, royalties, fees, compensation or
other payments provided for in the Agreement. Any amounts so withheld shall be
treated as paid to

     

   



  

Seller and, accordingly, shall reduce the amounts otherwise owed to Seller.
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller as Seller may reasonably request to
avoid any such withholding requirement as permitted by applicable law (such
as, for example and not by way of limitation, Seller providing Purchaser such
certifications, affidavits or other instruments as will relieve Purchaser of
such withholding requirement or Seller obtaining from the relevant taxing
authority an exemption from such withholding requirement), provided, that,
Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from any Liability of
Purchaser as a result of Purchaser cooperating with Seller pursuant to this
sentence. Purchasers failure to provide Seller with notice that Purchaser is
required to withhold any amount shall not cause Purchaser to be liable to
Seller for such amount.

  

5. [Intentionally Omitted]

  

6. _Negative Covenants of Purchaser_. Except with the prior written consent of Seller, Purchaser shall not

  

(a) make any election under section 338 of the Code with respect to
International Rectifier (India) Limited or Xian IR Micro-Electronics Co.,
Ltd.;

  

(b) (i) cause or permit either IR Germany Holding GmbH or International
Rectifier Automotive Systems GmbH not to maintain the same accounting and
valuation principles and options to capitalize or to account liabilities
and/or to prepare their annual financial statements in a manner deviating
from the practice consistently applied in the past, unless such past practice
is in violation of the applicable accounting provisions of the German
Commercial Code or German generally accepted accounting principles, or (ii)
take any measure that (aa) would constitute a violation of the applicable
German capital maintenance rules or (bb) would otherwise bring or be likely
to bring either IR Germany Holding GmbH or International Rectifier Automotive
Systems GmbH in danger of becoming insolvent within the meaning of the German
Insolvency Act with respect to or within any fiscal period or portion thereof
falling before the expiration of one year following the Closing Date,
provided that Seller and its Affiliates are not in breach of Section 2.24 of
the Share Purchase Agreement between Purchaser and Seller dated as of the
date hereof with respect to the Shares of IR Germany Holding GmbH; Purchaser
shall in case of an insolvency by IR Germany Holding GmbH or International
Rectifier Automotive Systems GmbH indemnify and hold Seller harmless against
any claim brought by a potential receiver of these entities by virtue or in
connection with Purchaser failing to comply with its duties according to this
_Section 6(b)_ ; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that International Rectifier Automotive Systems GmbH is merged into IR
Germany Holding GmbH prior to Closing the foregoing covenant shall apply only
with respect to IR Germany Holding GmbH.

  

(c) unless Seller effectuates a merger of International Rectifier Automotive

maintain any fiscal unity that exists for German Income Tax purposes between
IR Germany Holding GmbH and International Rectifier Automotive Systems GmbH,
or fail to perform fully and timely all obligations relating thereto until
after June 30, 2007 **;**

     

   



  

(d) cause, permit or suffer any Company or any Subsidiary of a Company to:

  

(1) declare, pay or make any distribution or dividend with respect to its
capital stock,

  

(2) engage in a transaction described in section 304 of the Code,

ordinary course of business,

  

that, in any such case, could (A) change the amount treated as a dividend to
Seller under section 301 or 1248 or the Code with respect to such Company,
(B) affect the amount taken into account by Seller under section 951 of the
Code with respect to such Company, or (C) could reasonably be expected to
increase the liability of Seller for Taxes or under any Transaction
Agreement; provided that Purchaser may engage in any action listed in
_Section 6(a)_ or in this _Section 6(d)_ without Sellers consent if
Purchaser pays to Seller the net amount of any Taxes required to be paid by
Seller that would not be required to be paid but for such action (taking into
account the amount of any Taxes payable by Seller with respect to such
payment), and provided further that an election under section 338 of the Code
that is otherwise not prohibited by _Section 6(a)_ shall not be subject to
the provisions of this _Section 6(d)_.

  

7. _Tax Returns_.

  

(a) _Tax Returns for Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date._ Seller
shall prepare any Tax Returns required to be filed by each Company and
Subsidiary of a Company under the Laws of any jurisdiction for all periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared
in a manner that is

     

   



  

consistent with the historic practices and procedures of such Company or
Subsidiary and shall be subject to Purchasers review and approval before
filing. Seller shall make drafts of all such Tax Returns required to be filed
after the date hereof available for Purchasers review and approval, no later
than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns. Seller shall cause each Company and Subsidiary to timely file all
such Tax Returns required to be filed by such Company or Subsidiary on or
prior to the Closing Date (taking into account extensions actually obtained
on or prior to the Closing Date), and Purchaser shall cause each such Company
and Subsidiary to timely file all such Tax Returns required to be filed by
such Company or Subsidiary after the Closing Date (taking into account
extensions actually obtained on or prior to the Closing Date). Seller shall
duly and timely pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the Liabilities for Taxes
for such periods to the extent that they are not reflected as liabilities in
the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital Amount. Seller shall make
such payment to Purchaser no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
due date for filing the applicable Tax Return (or, if such Liability is
determined pursuant to a Tax Proceeding, no later than three (3) Business
Days before Purchaser is required to pay such Tax), and Purchaser shall
timely remit such payment to the appropriate Governmental Authority.

  

(b) _Tax Returns for Straddle Periods._ Purchaser shall prepare and timely
file all Tax Returns required to be filed by each Company and Subsidiary of a
Company under the Laws of any jurisdiction for any period that includes the
Closing Date and that does not end on the Closing Date or as a result of the
Closing (a " _Straddle Period_ "), and such Company or Subsidiary shall duly
and timely pay all Liabilities for Taxes shown on such Tax Returns. Seller
shall duly and timely pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the portion of the
Liabilities for Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Partial Period_ ") to the
extent that such Taxes are not reflected as liabilities in the calculation of
the Final Net Working Capital Amount, or to the extent that such Taxes are
reflected as liabilities in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital
Amount but are taken into account in determining the amount of a payment
required to be made by Seller to Purchaser under _Section 7(a)_. Seller shall
make such payment to Purchaser no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the due date for filing the applicable Tax Return for such Straddle Period
(or, if such Liability is determined pursuant to a Tax Proceeding, no later
than three (3) Business Days before Purchaser is required to pay such Tax),
and Purchaser shall timely remit such payment to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. Seller and Purchaser shall make any elections and take such other
actions as are reasonably available to cause the portion of any taxable
period that otherwise would not end on the Closing Date or as of the Closing
Date to be treated as a separate taxable year or period under applicable Tax
law of any non-U.S. jurisdiction, rather than as a Straddle Period.
Purchasers preparation and filing of Tax Returns for a Straddle Period shall
be consistent with the historic practices and procedures of such Company or
Subsidiary and shall be subject to Sellers review and approval before
filing.  Purchaser shall make drafts of all Tax Returns for Straddle
Periods available for Sellers review and approval no later than twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns.

  

(c) _Surrender of U.K. Tax Losses_. Seller and Purchaser shall, so far as
possible, cause International Rectifier Electronic Motion Systems Ltd. to
surrender to any

     

   



  

Affiliate of Seller designated by Seller all tax losses and reliefs arising
under the provisions of Section 393 of the U.K. Income and Corporation Taxes
Act of 1988 and Section 83 of the U.K. Finance Act of 1996 that are (i)
attributable to the Pre-Closing Partial Period (as that term is defined in
_Section 8(c)_ hereof) or the taxable years ending within 2005 or 2006, or
(ii) attributable to any other period ended prior to the Closing if and to
the extent that, as a result of such surrender, such losses and reliefs are
available to offset any adjustment made to the income of any Affiliate of
Seller by HM Revenue and Customs for such period pursuant to an audit or
enquiry (provided, that surrender pursuant to this clause (ii) shall require
the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no additional tax
losses and reliefs of International Rectifier Electronic Motion Systems Ltd.
shall be surrendered to any Affiliate of Seller.

  

(d) _Disagreements Regarding Certain Tax Returns._ Any disagreement between
Purchaser and Seller regarding any Tax Return for which Sellers or
Purchasers approval is required under _Section 7(a)_ or _7(b)_ hereof shall
be finally resolved by the Tax Arbitrator in accordance with _Section 3(d)_
hereof, and in connection therewith any such Tax Returns shall be filed and
amended in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3(e)_ hereof.

  

8. _Refunds, Indemnity and Allocation of Taxes_

  

(a) _Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Taxes
(including interest thereon) with respect to periods ending on or before the
Closing or attributable to any Pre-Closing Partial Period, except to the
extent such refund arises as the result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax
benefit from a period beginning on or after the Closing Date or to the extent
such refund is reflected in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital
Amount.

  

(b) _Indemnity for Subpart F Inclusion_.  Seller shall indemnify Purchaser
and hold it harmless from and against any Liability of Purchaser (or an
Affiliate of Purchaser) for Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Partial
Period (as that term is defined in _Section 8(c)_ hereof) that are imposed on
Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser) pursuant to section 951 of the Code
as a result of Purchasers (or an Affiliate of Purchasers) ownership of
Shares on the last day of a Straddle Period.

  

(c) _Allocation of Taxes_. In the case of any Straddle Period (i) the amount
of any Income Taxes and other Taxes that can be reasonably allocated based on
an interim closing of the books method (including any Taxes imposed on the
Purchaser (or an Affiliate of the Purchaser) pursuant to section 951 of the
Code as a result of such partys ownership of Shares) attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing
Partial Period") shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books
as of the close of business on the Closing Date; and (ii) the amount of all
other Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Partial Period shall be determined
by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Partial Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period.  For purposes of

     

   



  

clause (i) of this _Section 8(c)_ , any extraordinary transaction outside the
ordinary course of business that occurs on the Closing Date but after the
Closing shall be considered to occur on the day following the Closing Date.

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto intend that any Tax Return
required to be filed pursuant to _Section 7(a)_ or _Section 7(b)_ of this
Agreement shall be included in the scope of the Tax Returns covered by the
representations made by Seller in Section 3.7(a) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement and Section 2.5(a) of each Stock Purchase Agreement.

  

9. _Cooperation_. Seller and Purchaser agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon reasonable request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (including, without limitation, access to books and records) relating to the Assets, any Company or any Subsidiary of a Company as is reasonably necessary for the preparation of any Tax Return (including but not limited to preparation of Tax Returns in accordance herewith) or claim for refund or for the prosecution or defense of such claim or any Seller Tax Contest, Straddle Period Tax Contest, or Purchaser Tax Contest. Any information obtained pursuant hereto shall be kept confidential by the Parties (unless disclosure is required by law or legal process or by a regulatory authority). During the pendency of any Tax Proceeding that arises within ten (10) years after the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries, including the Companies, to) use reasonable efforts to preserve materials, books, records and files relating to the matters at issue in such Tax Proceeding. Nothing herein, and nothing in any Transaction Agreement, shall require disclosure of (i) any Tax Return of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller other than a Company or Subsidiary of a Company (though information on such Tax Returns may be required) or (ii) any attorney-client communication, any attorney work product, or any otherwise privileged document or information.

  

10. _Tax Proceedings_. Seller and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to each other of the receipt by it or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Companies) of any proposed adjustment to Taxes and of the commencement of any Tax audit, Tax examination or Tax litigation relating to Taxes of a Company or Subsidiary for a period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period (or for any subsequent period or portion thereof the resolution of which could affect the liability of Seller or a Company or a Subsidiary for Taxes for any such period or that could affect the liability of a Seller under any Transaction Agreement) (each, together with any related administrative appeal or litigation, a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such proposed adjustment or such Tax Proceeding. The failure of Purchaser or Seller to give notice to the other party of a Tax Proceeding as required by this _Section 10_  shall not affect such first partys rights under this Agreement except to the extent that such failure is prejudicial to a defense of such Tax Proceeding.

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 10_, Seller and Purchaser (i)
shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, including the
Companies, to) cooperate with each other in the conduct of any such Tax
Proceeding, and (ii) may participate in any such Tax Proceeding at its own
expense.

     

   



  

(b) Seller shall have the exclusive right to control the conduct and
settlement of any Tax Proceeding involving a Company or Subsidiary of a
Company and relating to a period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (a "
_Seller Tax Contest_ "), including the right to pursue or forego any such Tax
Proceeding or the continuation thereof, and Purchaser and the Company shall
execute or cause to be executed powers of attorney or other necessary
documents in order for Seller to exercise such control; provided, however,
that (i) counsel for the Seller in any Seller Tax Contest shall consult in
good faith with a single counsel selected by the Purchaser in connection with
the Seller Tax Contest and shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed regarding
such Seller Tax Contest, (ii) the Seller shall not resolve or settle any
Seller Tax Contest if such resolution or settlement would or could reasonably
be anticipated to result in an increase in liability for Tax of Purchaser or
any Subsidiary of Purchaser (including the Companies) for any taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning on or after Closing Date, unless Purchaser
consents to that resolution or settlement (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (iii) the Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser copies of all written communications to and from any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such Seller Tax Contest and will
give Purchaser the option to attend all conferences (telephonic
or otherwise), subject to Purchasers execution of a commercially
reasonable confidentiality agreement.

  

(c) Purchaser shall control the conduct and settlement of any Tax Proceeding
(including the right to pursue or forego any such Tax Proceeding or the
continuation thereof) that relates to a Straddle Period (a " _Straddle Period
Tax Contest_ "), and in the exercise of such control Purchaser shall act
reasonably.  In connection with any Straddle Period Tax Contest, (i) counsel
for Purchaser shall consult in good faith with a single counsel selected by
Seller, and shall keep the other counsel reasonably informed, (ii) any
resolution or settlement of any Straddle Period Tax Contest shall require the
consent of both Seller and Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (iii) the Seller and Purchaser each
shall deliver to the other copies of all written communications to and from
any Governmental Authority in respect of any such Straddle Period Tax Contest
and will give the other the option to attend all conferences (telephonic
or otherwise), subject to the others execution of a commercially
reasonable confidentiality agreement.

  

(d) Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to control the conduct and
settlement of any Tax Proceeding involving a Company or a Subsidiary of a
Company relating to a period beginning on or after, the Closing Date (a "
_Purchaser Tax Contest_ "), including the right to pursue or forego any such
Tax Proceeding or the continuation thereof; provided, however, that, if, and
only to the extent that, the resolution of a Purchaser Tax Contest could
affect the liability of Seller or a Company or a Subsidiary of a Company for
Taxes for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing
Date or affect the liability of a Seller under any Transaction Agreement,
then (i) counsel for the Purchaser in any Purchaser Tax Contest shall consult
in good faith with a single counsel selected by the Seller in connection with
the Purchaser Tax Contest and shall keep Seller reasonably informed regarding
such Purchaser Tax Contest, (ii) the Purchaser shall not resolve or settle
any Purchaser Tax Contest if, and to the extent that, such resolution or
settlement would or could reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase

     

   



  

in liability for Tax of Seller for any period (or portion thereof) or affect
the liability of Seller under any Transaction Agreement, unless Purchaser
consents to that resolution or settlement (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (iii) the Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller copies of all written communications to and from any
Governmental Authority in respect of any such Purchaser Tax Contest and will
give Seller the option to attend all conferences (telephonic or otherwise),
subject to Sellers execution of a commercially reasonable confidentiality
agreement, to the extent such communications or conferences relate to matters
that could affect the liability of Seller or a Company or a Subsidiary of a
Company for Taxes for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Closing Date or affect the liability of a Seller under any Transaction
Agreement.

  

(e) Any disagreement between Purchaser and Seller regarding any approval
required of one of them with respect to a Tax Proceeding shall be submitted
to the Tax Arbitrator for resolution in accordance with the procedures of
_Section 3(e)_ hereof and, if applicable, Tax Returns affected thereby shall
be filed and amended in accordance with the procedures of _Section 3(f)_
hereof.
