other Person. The Company is not liable for the Taxes of any other Person,
other than withholding Taxes arising in the ordinary course of business. No
claim has ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where
the Company does not file a Tax Return that the Company or is or may be
subject to Tax in that jurisdiction.

  

  

(d) The Company timely and properly elected to be an S corporation (within the
meaning of Section 1361(a)(1) of the Code) on Form 2553 filed on and duly
effective on November 1, 1990 (the "Election Date") with the IRS, and at all
times since that date has continuously remained an S corporation. In addition,
the Company has timely and properly elected to be an S corporation in every
taxing jurisdiction that recognizes S corporations and where the Company is
subject to Tax, and at all times since then has continuously remained an S
corporation in such jurisdictions. The Company has been a validly electing S
corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code since the
Election Date and the Company will be an S corporation up to and including the
Closing Date. The Company has not been taxable as anything other than an S
corporation in each taxing jurisdiction that recognizes S corporations since
the Election Date. Neither the Company, any Seller, nor any former stockholder
of the Company has taken any action or made any filing that would terminate
the Company's status as an S corporation for federal, state or local income
Tax purposes. None of the IRS nor any other taxing authority has ever
challenged, disputed, or otherwise contested the Company's status as an S
corporation for federal, state, or local income Tax purposes. Since the
Election Date, no shares of capital stock of the Company have been held by any
person or entity that was ineligible to be an S Corporation shareholder. For
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Canadian Subsidiary is and has been
since its incorporation, an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate
from the Company.

  

  

(e) The Company does not own any assets, the disposition of which would give
rise to any Tax under Section 1374 of the Code (or under comparable provisions
of state or local Tax law).

  

  

(f) Neither the Company, nor the Canadian Subsidiary, have filed or been party
to any election pursuant to section 85 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), or the
corresponding provisions of any provincial or territorial taxing statute.

  

  

(g) The Canadian Subsidiary has not deducted any amount in computing its
income in a taxation year which may be included in a subsequent taxation year
under section 78 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or the similar provisions of
any provincial or territorial taxing statute.

  

  

(h) No circumstances exist which would make the Canadian Subsidiary subject to
the application of section 17 or any of sections 79 to 80.04 of the Income Tax
Act (Canada) or the similar provisions of any provincial or territorial taxing
statute.

  

  

(i) The Canadian Subsidiary has not claimed and will not claim any reserve
under any one or more of subparagraph 40(1)(a)(iii), or paragraphs 20(1)(m) or
20(1)(n) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any equivalent provincial or
territorial provision, if any such amount could be included in the Canadian
Subsidiary's income for any period ending after the Closing Date.

  

  

(j) The Canadian Subsidiary has not acquired property from a non-arm's length
person, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada), for consideration,
the value of which is less than the fair market value of the property
acquired, in circumstances which would subject the Canadian Subsidiary to a
liability under section 160 of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

  

  

(k) Notices of Determination of Loss, under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (and
any relevant provincial or territorial taxing statute), have neither been
requested by nor issued to the Canadian Subsidiary for any fiscal periods.

  

  

(l) The Canadian Subsidiary has prepared on a timely basis and maintained
transfer pricing documentation as required by subsection 247(4) of the Income
Tax Act (Canada).

council or any other employee body representing workers, and has not
experienced any strikes, grievances, claims of unfair labor practices, or
other collective bargaining disputes in the past three years. To the knowledge
of the Company, there is no organizational effort currently being made or
threatened by or on behalf of any labor union, trade union, employee
representative(s), staff association, work council or any other employee body
representing workers with respect to employees of the Company. To the
knowledge of the Company, there is no labor strike, slowdown or stoppage
pending or threatened against the Company.

who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting.

(i) Each Seller agrees to join, in an appropriate and timely manner, with
Buyer in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any
corresponding election permitted under any local, state or foreign
jurisdiction (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to
Buyer's acquisition of the Purchased Stock. Each Seller agrees to cooperate
with Buyer to take all actions necessary or appropriate to effect and preserve

the Sellers a schedule allocating the Purchase Price (and liabilities of the
Company and other relevant items) among the assets of the Company (the
"Purchase Price Allocation Schedule"). The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule

consistent with the methodologies set forth on Schedule 5.7(a). The Sellers
may review the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and discuss with the Buyer
any reasonable revisions thereto and the Buyer shall, subject to applicable
law, make such revisions thereto as are reasonably requested by the Sellers so
long as, and to the extent, the Closing 338(h)(10) Tax Amount is greater than
$3,000,000, subject to applicable law. Buyer and each Seller agree for all
relevant Tax reporting purposes, including the preparation of IRS Form 8883,
to report the transactions in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule. The Buyer and Sellers shall make appropriate adjustments to the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to reflect changes in the Purchase Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer and each Seller agrees than an amount
equal to $500,000 of the Purchase Price payable to each Seller shall be
allocated to the covenants contained in such Seller's Noncompetition
Agreement.

  

  

(iii) Buyer and each Seller shall prepare all Tax Returns consistent with, and
take no position that is inconsistent with, the Section 338(h)(10) Election,

timely file such Tax Returns. The Company shall permit the Sellers and the
Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return at least ten (10) days
prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are

include in his federal and state income tax returns all items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit attributable to the S Final Year of the Company

Election) in a manner consistent with Form 1120S and schedules thereto (and
the corresponding state income tax forms and schedules) to be filed by the
Company with respect to such period; and (ii) pay any and all Taxes required
to be paid for all taxable years of the Sellers, including the taxable year
that includes the S Final Year, that are attributable to the Sellers' stock
ownership in the Company. The Sellers shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify and hold the Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiary harmless against,
all Taxes (i) of the Sellers,

  

  

 

 

EX-21

 

  

   

  

 

  (ii) of, or imposed on, the Company or the Subsidiary that relate to
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including any Taxes
related to the transfer of the Canadian Affiliate Property to Sellers Canadian
Affiliate or the deemed asset sale resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election), and (iii) of, or imposed on, the Company or the Subsidiary that
relate to the pre-Closing portion of a taxable period that includes but does
not end on the Closing Date as determined under this Section 5.7(b) (including
any Taxes related to the transfer of the Canadian Affiliate Property to
Sellers Canadian Affiliate or the deemed asset sale resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election), and shall pay to (or as directed by) the Company amounts
equal to such Taxes. Such payments shall be made in each applicable case by no
later than five (5) business days prior to the due date for paying such amount
of Taxes to the relevant tax authority. For purposes of this Section 5.7(b),
in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable
for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the
portion of such Tax that relates to the pre-Closing period shall (a) in the
case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, receipts
or payroll, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (b) in the case of any
Tax based upon or related to income, receipts or payroll, be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the
Closing Date. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and
ends after the Closing Date shall be allocated on a basis consistent with the
allocations made pursuant to the preceding sentence.

 

  

  

(c) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(i) The Buyer, the Company and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, to the
extent reasonably requested by another, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to Section 5.7(b) or otherwise, and any Contest. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return filing and/or Contest and making employees available on a
mutually convenient reasonable basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  

  

(ii) If requested by the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers will cooperate
with the Buyer to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed upon the Company or the
Canadian Subsidiary (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
Transactions).

  

  

(iii) Except (x) to the extent taken into account as an asset in the final
determination of Closing Working Capital or included in Closing Prepaid Taxes,
or (y) attributable to the carryback of a loss, item or credit from a taxable
period ending after the Closing Date, all Tax refunds relating to taxable
periods or any portion thereof ending on the Closing Date, whether received in
cash or applied to a subsequent taxable period, shall be solely for the
benefit of the Sellers, and the Buyer shall cause the same to be paid promptly
to the Sellers.

  

  

(d) Control of Audits. After the Closing Date, except as set forth in the next
sentence, the Company shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own
choosing, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiary (each, a "Contest"). In the case of a Contest after
the Closing Date that relates to a taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall control the conduct of such Contest, using
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, but the Company shall have the
right to participate in such Contest at its own expense, and the Sellers shall
not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that could
affect the Tax liability of the Company or the Canadian Subsidiary for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without
the written consent of Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
this Section 5.7(d) and the provisions of Article VII, the provisions of this
Section 5.7(d) shall control.

  

  

(e) Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains,
stamp, registration, and other such Taxes and fees incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be paid by the Sellers when due, and the Company will, at
the Sellers' expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property
gains, stamp, registration, and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable law, the Buyer and the Sellers will join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  

  

5.8. Physical Inventory. The Company shall conduct a "wall-to-wall" physical
count of the inventory of the Company or the Canadian Subsidiary (the
"Physical Inventory") during a period not to exceed five (5) days prior to the
Closing, which physical count may be observed by representatives of the
Sellers and the Buyer. The Company shall grant the Sellers and the Buyer and
their representatives unrestricted access to the Company's and the Canadian
Subsidiary's inventory in connection with observing the Physical Inventory.
The final inventory count resulting from the Physical Inventory will be
accounted for using the average cost methodology, which amounts and values
shall be used in the calculation of Closing Working Capital in accordance with
this Agreement.

records and other information of the Company and its Subsidiary solely as
reasonably necessary relating to the Sellers' ownership of the Company or the
Subsidiary prior to the Closing including, without limitation, the preparation
of Tax Returns. In the event of any litigation or threatened litigation
between the parties relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, the
covenants contained in this Section 5.9 shall not be considered a waiver by
any party of any right to assert the attorney-client privilege or any similar
privilege.

  

  

5.10. Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to

things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

5.11. Transition. None of the Sellers shall take any action that is designed
or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,
supplier, or other business associate of the Company or the Canadian
Subsidiary, as the case may be, from maintaining the same business
relationships with the Company after the Closing as it maintained with the
Company prior to the Closing.

  

  

5.12. Litigation Assistance. Upon the reasonable request of the Buyer, the
Sellers shall cooperate with the Company or the Canadian Subsidiary in the
defense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may
be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company or the Canadian
Subsidiary that relate to events or occurrences that transpired prior to the
Closing Date. The Sellers' cooperation in connection with such claims or
actions shall include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with
counsel to prepare for discovery or trial and to act as a witness on behalf of
the Company or the Canadian Subsidiary at mutually convenient times. Upon the
reasonable request of the Buyer, the Sellers also shall cooperate with the
Company or the Canadian Subsidiary in connection with any investigation or
review by any federal, state or local regulatory authority as any such
investigation or review relates to events or occurrences that transpired prior
to the Closing Date. The Company shall reimburse the Sellers for any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the Sellers' performance of obligations pursuant to this Section 5.12.

  The Company and the Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
transfer, assign or hold, good title to all personal property and equipment
installed and located at the New Houston Facility to the Company. At the
Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Buyer that the Company holds good title to all personal property and
equipment installed and located at the New Houston Facility as of the Closing

Houston Facility will be owned by WSL. The Sellers shall pay, reimburse and
indemnify the Buyer for any and all such costs, fees and expenses and other
Losses of the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company on and after the

Sellers and the Company shall cooperate with the Buyer, and consider
recommendations from legal counsel, in good faith in order for the Buyer to
acquire, directly or indirectly, the Canadian Subsidiary and its operations in
a manner the Buyer proposes given the structure of the Debt Financing or
Financing Sources for the Transactions and in a manner which minimizes the
federal, state, provincial and territorial tax liabilities of the Buyer
incurred in connection with the direct or indirect acquisition of the Canadian
Subsidiary or its operations; provided, however, that no such action shall be
taken if it shall have the effect of increasing the Sellers' direct or
indirect tax costs or tax liabilities unless the Buyer shall fully be

costs or liabilities. Subject to the foregoing, on or prior to the Closing,
the Buyer may fully assign the right to purchase the outstanding capital stock
of the Canadian Subsidiary to one or more of its Affiliates. In such event,
the Company shall be deemed a Seller and the Canadian Subsidiary shall be
deemed the Company for all purposes of this Agreement in respect of the sale
and purchase of all the shares of outstanding capital stock of the Canadian
Subsidiary.

  

  

5.19. Releases. Each Seller, for him and his heirs, spouse, personal
representatives, successors, and assigns (collectively, the "Releasors"),
hereby forever fully and irrevocably releases and discharges the Buyer, the
Company, the Canadian Subsidiary and their respective predecessors,
successors, direct or indirect subsidiaries and past and present stockholders,
members (direct and indirect), managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents, and representatives (collectively, the "Released Parties") from any

liabilities or obligations of any kind whatsoever in law or equity and causes
of action of every kind and nature, or otherwise (including claims for

unanticipated as well as anticipated and that now exist or may hereinafter
accrue based on matters now known as well as unknown (collectively, the

indirectly asserting any claim or demand or commencing (or causing to be
commenced) any Proceeding of any kind before any Government Authority or other
tribunal, against any Released Party based upon any Released Claim, and
further agrees not to make claim or take proceedings with respect to any

or take any actions to collect, the Norquest Receivable.

ARTICLE VII

  

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

7.1. Survival. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
and in the certificates delivered at the Closing pursuant to Sections 6.1(c)
and 6.2(c) shall survive the Closing until the two-year anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties
in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.7, 2.18, 2.21, 2.22, 3.1 and 3.2 and the
representations and warranties related to title to the assets of the Company
and the Canadian Subsidiary and (ii) fraud or intentional breaches of any
representation or warranty (collectively (i) and (ii), the "Special
Representations") shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and, for
purposes of Section 2.18, including the period, if any, during which an
assessment, reassessment or other form of recognized document assessing
liability for Taxes could be issued (in each instance, the end date of the
applicable survival period is herein referred to as the "Cut-off Date"). No
claim for breach of any representation or warranty may be brought after the
Cut-Off Date, except for any claim (a) made with reasonable specificity prior
to the Cut-Off Date, or (b) that is brought by the indemnifying party during
the Response Period as a counterclaim to a claim brought in accordance with
preceding clause (a). Each of the covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall survive until such time as it has been fully performed and
satisfied.

  

  

7.2. Indemnification of the Buyer. Subject to the other terms of this Article
VII, the Sellers shall severally (with each Seller bearing one-half of such
obligation or liability), and not jointly, indemnify and hold the Buyer and
its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents, including, after the Closing, the Company and the Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless without limit from
all Losses incurred by them that relate to or arise from: (a) any breach of
any of the representations or warranties of the Company contained in Article
II or the certificate delivered at the Closing by the Company pursuant to
Section 6.1(c), (b) any breach of the representations and warranties of the
Sellers contained in Article III, (c) the failure of the Sellers to perform
any of their covenants or agreements contained herein, (d) the failure of the
Company to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained herein that
are required to be performed prior to the Closing, or (e) any Designated
Liabilities. The Buyer's right to make claims under this Section, however,
shall be subject to the following limitations and conditions:

  

  

(i) No claim under Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b), shall be made unless, and only to
the extent that, the cumulative amount of Losses incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for all claims exceeds an amount equal to $500,000 (the
"Threshold Amount"), and then only to the extent of such excess; provided,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, making any claim, and being indemnified
fully from the first dollar of Loss with respect thereto, under Section 7.2(a)
or 7.2(b) relating to the Special Representations shall not be subject to the
limitations of the Threshold Amount.

  

  

(ii) The aggregate liability of the Sellers to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for Losses for claims under Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) shall not exceed, in the
aggregate, $32,000,000 (exclusive of the Threshold Amount); provided, however,
that such limitation shall not apply with respect to (i) any Losses resulting
from or relating to a breach of any of the Special Representations, (ii) any
indemnification pursuant to Section 5.7, (iii) any Designated Liabilities or
(iv) any action arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the
Company or the Sellers. Notwithstanding the limitations in the preceding
sentence, in no event (other than fraud or intentional misrepresentation)
shall the Sellers' aggregate liability for indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement exceed the Purchase Price plus the aggregate amount of the Closing
Indebtedness.

  

  

(iii) None of the Buyer, the Company or the Sellers may assign their rights in
the Escrow Fund or any interest therein without the prior written consent of
the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers.

  

  

7.3. Indemnification of the Sellers. Subject to the other terms of this
Article VII, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold
the Sellers and their Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") harmless from Losses incurred by them which arise or result from (a)
any breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Buyer contained
in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered at the Closing by the Buyer
pursuant to Section 6.2(c), or (b) the failure of the Buyer to perform any of
its covenants or agreements set forth herein. No claim for a breach of a
representation or warranty shall be made by the Sellers under this Section 7.3
unless, and only to the extent that, the cumulative amount of Losses incurred
by the Seller Indemnified Parties for all claims exceeds the Threshold Amount,
and then only to the extent of such excess. The aggregate liability of the
Buyer to the Seller Indemnified Parties for Losses under such claims shall not
exceed, in the aggregate, the Purchase Price; provided, however, that such
limitation shall not apply with respect to any action arising from fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by the Buyer.

  

  

7.4. Procedure for Indemnification.

  

(a) Any party hereto entitled to make a claim for indemnification hereunder
shall promptly notify the indemnifying party of the claim in writing upon
learning of such claim or the facts constituting such claim, describing the
claim in reasonable detail, the amount thereof (if known), and the basis
therefore. The indemnifying party will be relieved of its indemnification
obligations hereunder to the extent that it is prejudiced by the indemnified
party's failure to give such prompt notice.

  

  

 

 

EX-28

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(b) If a claim for indemnification hereunder is based on a claim by a third
party, the indemnifying party shall have the right, by notice to the
indemnified party within twenty (20) days, to assume the entire control of the
defense thereof including, at its own expense, employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, that the
indemnified party may participate in any proceeding with counsel of its choice
at its expense. In such event, the indemnifying party shall have the right to
settle or resolve any such claim by a third party; provided, however, that no
party will approve the entry of any judgment or order or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to the claim without the other party's
prior written approval (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or
conditioned).

  

  

(c) The party claiming indemnification shall cooperate fully with the
indemnifying party and make available to the indemnifying party all pertinent
information under its control. Such cooperation shall include, without
limitation, (i) reasonably assisting in the collection and preparation of
discovery materials, and (ii) making employees available to meet, prepare for
and/or appear as witnesses at depositions, court proceedings and/or trial.

  

  

7.5. Determination of Losses. As used herein, "Losses" means all damages,
losses, expenses, costs and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses), in each case, including, without limitation, arising from
matters disclosed to the Buyer or its Affiliates or otherwise referenced in
this Agreement. In determining the amount of any Losses for which a Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder,
the amount of any such Losses shall be determined after deducting therefrom
the amount of any insurance proceeds (after giving effect to any applicable
deductible or retention) and other third party recoveries actually received by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Company or the Subsidiary in respect of
such Losses (which proceeds and recoveries the Buyer agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain). If an indemnification payment is
received by a Buyer Indemnified Party, and any Buyer Indemnified Party, the
Company or the Subsidiary later receives insurance proceeds, or other third
party recoveries in respect of the related Losses, the Buyer shall promptly
pay to the Sellers (with each Seller receiving one-half of such amount) an
amount equal to the lesser of (a) the actual amount of such insurance
proceeds, or other third party recoveries or (b) the actual amount of the
indemnification payment previously paid by the Sellers with respect to such
Losses. All parties shall use commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate the
amount of Losses for which they may be entitled to indemnification hereunder,
including but not limited to any Losses that result from any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 2.14.

  

  

7.6. Subrogation. If (a) the Buyer receives Sellers indemnification payments
hereunder, (directly or from the Escrow Fund) and (b) the Buyer, the Company
or the Subsidiary has or may have a claim against a third party (including,
without limitation, any insurer) in respect of the related Losses, at the
request of the Sellers, the Sellers shall be subrogated to the rights and
claims of the Buyer, the Company and/or the Subsidiary, as the case may be,
against such third party. The Sellers shall not, however, have the right to
collect aggregate payments from such third party or third parties in excess of
the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid with respect
to such Losses. The Buyer and the Company will, and will cause the Subsidiary
to, execute and deliver to the Sellers such documents and take such other
actions as may reasonably be requested in order to give effect to this
Section.

  

  

7.7. Remedies Exclusive. All representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive
remedies set forth herein, except in the case of fraud by the Company or the
Sellers. Except as specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the
remedies provided in this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties and their
heirs, successors and permitted assigns after the Closing with respect to this
Agreement and the Transactions including, without limitation, any breach or
non-performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, in the absence of fraud and except for equitable relief. The
provisions of this Article VII constitute an integral part of the
consideration given to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement and were
specifically bargained for and reflected in the total amount of the Purchase
Price payable to the Sellers in connection with the Transactions.

  

  

7.8. Treatment of Indemnity Payments. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
it is the intention of the parties to treat any indemnity payment made under
this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes, and
the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly.

to the failure of the Transactions to occur on or before such date.

  

  

8.2. Effect of Termination.

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated as provided above, the parties shall have

to perform any of their material obligations or agreements under this
Agreement, (iii) a failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1
to be fully satisfied or fulfilled, (iv) there has occurred a Company Material
Adverse Effect since the date of this Agreement, or (v) a failure to obtain
required approval or consent from any Governmental Authority and the Agreement
is terminated hereunder, then the Buyer shall pay the Sellers liquidated
damages, in immediately available funds, in the amount of $2,500,000 (the
"Termination Damages") within ten (10) days of such termination. The Sellers'
right to receive the Termination Damages pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) shall
be the exclusive remedy of the Sellers or the Company against the Buyer, the
Financing Sources or any of their respective former, current or future
stockholders, controlling persons, general and limited partners, members,
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, managers or agents for any Loss
suffered as a result of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The obligations of the Buyer and its Affiliates and representatives under

party and such arbitrator shall be the sole arbitrator for the Arbitration and
if two arbitrators are selected by the parties within ten (10) business days
after Arbitration is sought as provided above, but the two arbitrators thus

shall select the third arbitrator.

  

  

 

 

EX-31

 

  

   

  

 

  The Parties agree that any Arbitration shall take place only in the State
of Delaware. In any such controversy, the arbitrators may grant any relief,
legal or equitable, interim or final, which could be granted by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Further, the parties shall have the right to enforce
this Agreement and to recover their respective costs and attorney fees
incurred in such enforcement, including any confirmation, modification, or
vacatur proceeding or appeal from such proceeding. All expenses of producing a
witness or witnesses shall be paid by the party who produces such witness or
witnesses. The arbitrators may award or apportion attorneys' fees and related
costs and all other expenses of the Arbitration (including AAA administrative
fees, required travel expenses, and fees and expenses of the arbitrators and
representatives of the AAA, and the expenses of any witnesses other than those
produced by a party) in their judgment as they deem appropriate.

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring any action, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Financing, the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan in the State of New York.

  

  

9.5. Specific Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the
failure of any party to this Agreement to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the other parties to this Agreement
for which monetary damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the granting of
equitable relief (including specific performance and injunctive relief) by any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce and party's obligations hereunder.
The parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such equitable relief and
that this Section 9.5 is without prejudice to any other rights that the
parties hereto may have for any failure to perform this Agreement.

  

  

9.6. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, successors and
assigns, but may not be assigned by any party without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers, except that the Buyer may
assign all or any portion of its rights hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates; provided, that no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of its
obligations hereunder; provided further, that the Buyer may assign this
Agreement and its rights under this Agreement to one or more of the Financing
Sources and any collateral agents in connection with the Debt Financing. Upon
any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to the Buyer
shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

  

  

9.7. Integration; Schedules.

  

(a) This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto
and the agreements referred to herein, embodies the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties with respect to the Transactions and
supersedes all prior discussions, understandings and agreements concerning the
matters covered hereby. The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define
their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the sale of the Purchased
Stock exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of
this Agreement; and the parties hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed
any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) No disclosure in any Schedule hereto relating to any possible breach or
violation of any agreement, Authorization or Legal Requirement shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred, or shall constitute an admission of liability
to any third party.

  

  

9.8. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
and with counterpart signature pages, each of which shall be an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement, binding on
all of the parties hereto notwithstanding that all such parties have not
signed the same counterpart. Counterpart signature pages to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in .pdf or .tiff
format, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original
graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, and will have the same effect
as physical delivery of the paper document bearing an original signature.

  

  

9.9. Expenses. All legal and other costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring
such costs and expenses, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

  

  

9.10. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement, including without limitation Section 5.19, nothing in this
Agreement will be construed as giving any third party any right, remedy or
claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision hereof; provided
that the Financing Sources shall be third party beneficiaries to Sections
5.21, 8.2(b), 9.4 and 9.6 and such Sections shall inure to the benefit of the
Financing Sources.

  

  

9.11. Publicity. No party shall issue a press release or make any other public
announcement concerning the Transactions without the prior written consent of
the Company, the Sellers and the Buyer, except to the extent required by law,
regulation or stock exchange rule in which case the other parties hereto shall
have the reasonable opportunity to review and comment prior to disclosure.

  

 

 

EX-32

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

9.12. Construction of Agreement.

  

  

(a) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or
illegal, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
law and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

  

  

(b) No Strict Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and
documents contemplated herein. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises under any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement or documents contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other
agreements or documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties thereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authoring any of the provisions of this
Agreement or any other agreements or documents contemplated herein.

  

  

(c) Headings. The headings of Articles and Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or
interpretation hereof.

  

  

(d) Currency. Unless otherwise specified herein, any references to "dollars",
"$" or other dollar amounts in this Agreement shall mean the lawful currency
of United States.

  

  

(e) Business Days. Any reference to a "business day" means any day except
Saturday, Sunday, any statutory holiday in the State of Delaware or any other
day on which the principal chartered banks in the State of New York are closed
for business.

  

  

(f) Calculation of Days. When calculating the period of time within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date which is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-business day, the
period in question shall end on the next business day.

  

  

(g) Pronouns. All words and personal pronouns shall be read and construed as
the number and gender of the party or parties referred to in each case require
and the verb shall be construed as agreeing with the required word and
pronoun.

  

  

(h) Legal Requirements and Documents. Unless otherwise specified, (i) any
references herein to any Legal Requirement shall be construed as a reference
thereto as in effect from time to time, and (ii) any reference to this
Agreement or any other document is a reference to this Agreement or such other
document as amended, restated and supplemented from time to time and includes
all schedules and exhibits thereto.

  

  

(i) References to this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein," "hereto",
"hereunder", "hereby" and other similar expressions refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular section or portion of it.

  

  

(j) Including. Where the word "including" or the word "includes" is used in
this Agreement, it means "including (or includes) without limitation".
