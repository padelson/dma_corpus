hereto, and, as so amended and restated, will be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by Florida Law and such articles of incorporation;

Section 1.06 _Conversion of Company Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
Company, any stockholder of Company or any other Person:

  



  

(a)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to, and contingent upon the
occurrence of, the Effective Time (excluding any shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 1.06(c)) will be converted into and represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. " _Merger Consideration_ " means (i) a
number of shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock of Parent, no par value per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_
"), equal to the Exchange Ratio, plus (ii) any Additional Consideration, to
the extent issuable pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.07, plus
(iii) any Milestone Shares to the extent earned pursuant to, and in accordance
with, Section 1.12 of this Agreement, in each case, with any resulting
fractional shares to be rounded down to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(b)  _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock then
outstanding will be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any
such shares will, as of the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(c)  _Cancellation_. Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury
of Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Company or Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and without payment
of any consideration therefor and cease to exist.

  



  

(d)  _Company Options_. Each Company Option under the Company Option Plan
that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be subject to Section 5.16. Prior to the Closing Date, and subject
to the review and approval of Parent, Company will take all actions necessary
to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.06(d) under
applicable Legal Requirements and all such Company Options, including
delivering all notices required thereby and, if required, entering into
termination agreements with the holders of such Company Options. In addition,
promptly after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days before the Effective Time, and subject to the review and
approval of Parent, Company shall deliver notice to all holders of Company
Options setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(e)  _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued in connection with the Merger, and any fractional shares will be
rounded down to the nearest whole share. Company Stockholders will not be
entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or
distributions or other rights as a stockholder of Parent with respect to any
such fraction of a share that would have otherwise been issued to such
Company Stockholder.

  



  

(f)  _Restrictions_. If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract with Company or under
which Company has any rights, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock, subject to Section 5.16,
and in connection with any Milestone Event, subject to Section 1.12, will also
be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition, and the book-entry representing such shares of Parent Common
Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Company will take
all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right
set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract.

Section 1.07 _Additional Consideration_. The Merger Consideration includes
the right to receive additional consideration payable in cash as provided in
this Section 1.07 (the " _Additional Consideration_ "). Not later than thirty
(30) days after the two-year anniversary of the Effective Date, the Parent
shall cause its Exchange Agent to pay to the Company Stockholders on a pro
rata basis an amount in cash equal to the aggregate cash proceeds received by
Parent from the exercise of any Company Option assumed by the Parent prior to
the second year anniversary of the Effective Time. The Additional
Consideration shall be limited and will not exceed the maximum amount of cash
consideration that may be received by the Company Stockholders
without affecting the intended tax consequences of the Merger, as described
in _Section 1.11_.

  



  

Section 1.08 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a)  _Exchange Agent_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent will select
Parent's transfer agent or another reputable bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent will issue and cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent non-
certificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by book-entry issuable
pursuant to Section 1.06(a). The shares of Parent Common Stock so deposited
with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions
received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are referred to
collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_."

  



  

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the record
holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and containing such provisions on which Parent and Company may
mutually agree (and which will include a provision confirming that delivery
of Company Stock Certificates will be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Company Stock Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock
Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for non-
certificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by book-entry issuable
pursuant to Section 1.06(a). Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate
to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (A) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor non-certificated
shares of Parent Common Stock represented by book-entry (via DRS) equal to the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.06(a), and (B) the Company
Stock Certificate so surrendered will be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.08(b), each Company Stock Certificate held by
a Company Stockholder will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. If any Company
Stock Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate
to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

(c)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with
a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger
until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance
with this Section 1.08 (at which time such holder will be entitled, subject to
the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such
dividends and distributions, without interest).

  



  

(d)  _Transfers of Ownership_. If any shares of Parent Common Stock are to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Company Stock Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any Person
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(e)  _Unclaimed Portion of the Exchange Fund_.

  



       | (i)  | Any  portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days
after  the date on which the Merger becomes effective will be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates  who have
not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance
with this Section 1.08 will thereafter  look only to Parent for satisfaction
of their claims for Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions
with respect  to Parent Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 
     |   | 
     | (ii)  | Neither  Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any
other  Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto), or for any  cash amounts, delivered
to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law,
escheat law or similar Legal  Requirement. 
  



  

(f)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely
paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts will be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

Section 1.09 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and all
holders of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights as stockholders of
Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of Company will be closed with
respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common
Stock will be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is
presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate will be canceled and exchanged as provided in
Sections 1.06 and 1.08.

Section 1.10 _No Further Rights_. The Merger Consideration delivered upon
the surrender for exchange of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement will be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares.

  



  

Section 1.11 _Tax Consequences_. For United States federal income Tax
purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury Regulations, and will report consistently
with the foregoing, including by filing the statement required by Section
1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations.

(a) The Merger Consideration includes the right to receive contingent
consideration, which shall be paid to the Company Stockholders in the manner
described in this Section 1.12, and at the times and if, and only if, the
conditions to such contingent payments described in this Section 1.12 are
satisfied.

  



  

(b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in the table below
under "Milestone Event" (each, a " _Milestone Event_ "), Parent will be
obligated to make the payment set forth in the table below under "Milestone
Payment" that is opposite the Milestone Event that has occurred (such amount,
the " _Milestone Payment_ "), which Milestone Payment shall be made in
accordance with Section 1.12(c).

  



     Milestone Event|   | Milestone Payment 
---|---|--- 
   Market Capitalization of Parent for at least 10 Trading Days during any
20 consecutive Trading Day period during the Milestone Period is equal to or
greater than $500,000,000 (the " _First Milestone Event_ ").|   |
$20,000,000 
   |   | 
   For every $250,000,000 incremental increase in Market Capitalization of
Parent after the First Milestone Event to the extent such incremental increase
occurs for at least 10 Trading Days during any 20 consecutive Trading Day
period during the Milestone Period, up to a $1,000,000,000 Market
Capitalization of Parent.|   | $10,000,000 per each incremental increase (it
being understood, however, that, if such incremental increase results in
Market Capitalization equal to $1,000,000,000, such $10,000,000 payment in
respect of such incremental increase shall be payable without duplication of
any amount payable in respect of a Second Milestone Event). 
   |   | 
   Market Capitalization of Parent for at least 10 Trading Days during any
20 consecutive Trading Day period is equal to or greater than $1,000,000,000
(the " _Second Milestone Event_ ") |   | $25,000,000. 
   |   | 
   For every $1,000,000,000 incremental increase in Market Capitalization of

(c) Milestone Payments shall be payable by Parent in shares of Parent Common
Stock (such shares, the " _Milestone Shares_ "). The number of Milestone

dollar value of the applicable Milestone Payment set forth in Section
1.12(b), divided by (ii) the Milestone Stock Price as of the Milestone
Achievement Date. Promptly after the occurrence of a Milestone Event (and in
any event, no later than five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of such
Milestone Event), Parent shall cause its Exchange Agent to issue to each
Company Stockholder a number of Milestone Shares from Parent's authorized and
unissued shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Company Stockholder

successor entity in such Parent Change in Control or Asset Divestiture (the "
_Acquiror_ ") shall assume all applicable obligations of Parent under this
Agreement (and shall be deemed to be Parent for purposes hereof and thereof
without relieving Parent of its obligations hereunder and thereunder) and if
the consideration per share of Parent Common Stock payable to the Parent's
stockholders in such Parent Change in Control or Asset Divestiture would value
the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock in amount equal to a Market
Capitalization that would trigger a Milestone Payment (without regard to any
requirement set forth above that such Market Capitalization be maintained for
any number of Trading Days), the applicable Milestone Payment shall be due
and payable immediately prior to the consummation of such Parent Change in
Control or Asset Divestiture.

  



  

Section 1.13 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary, desirable or proper to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,

business). No Acquired Company has ever been part of a consolidated group

or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any Tax period (or

claim or otherwise has any knowledge of any claim that any Company Owned IP
Right, or that the manufacture, sale, offer for sale, development, use or

Tax Return was filed), and no waiver or agreement by or with respect to an
Acquiring Company is in force for the extension of time for the payment,

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(collectively, the " _Parent Owned IP Rights_ "). Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of a claim or otherwise has
any knowledge of any claim that any Parent Owned IP Right, or that the
manufacture, sale, offer for sale, development, use or importation of any

risks and losses that are reasonably adequate for the operation of Parent's
and its Subsidiaries' businesses in all material respects. To Parent's
knowledge, such Parent Insurance Policies are in full force and effect,
maintained with reputable companies against loss relating to the business,
operations and properties and such other risks as companies engaged in

business practice, customarily insure. Since the Parent Lookback Date, all
premiums due and payable under such Parent Insurance Policies have been paid

of such Parent Insurance Policies, or summaries of all terms material
thereof, have been made available to Company.

timely fashion and no Acquiring Company has been refused insurance for which
it has applied or had any policy of insurance terminated (other than at its
request), nor has any Acquiring Company received written (or, to the
knowledge of Parent, oral) notice from any insurance carrier that: (i) such
insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or
eliminated; or (ii) premium costs with respect to such insurance will be
increased, other than premium increases in the ordinary course of business
applicable on their terms to all holders of similar policies.

and read a copy of Section 607.1302 of Florida Law, and (iii) acknowledging
that by its approval of the Merger it is not entitled to appraisal rights
with respect to its shares in connection with the Merger and thereby waives
any rights to receive payment of the fair value of its Company Common Stock

the record date established for the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, the S-4
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The Parent

to ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if

scheduled, Parent reasonably believes that (A) it will not receive proxies
sufficient to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum
would be present or (B) it will not have sufficient shares of Parent Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting,

Recommendation_ "); (iii) the Parent Board Recommendation shall not be
withheld, amended, withdrawn or modified (and the Parent Board shall not,
except to the extent required by applicable law, publicly propose to
withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the Parent Board Recommendation) in a
manner adverse to Company, and no resolution by the Parent Board or any
committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Parent Board Recommendation in a

Stockholder Approval, including by soliciting proxies in favor thereof.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.03(b),
and subject to compliance with Section 5.13, at any time prior to the approval
of the Parent Stockholder Approval Matters by the Parent Stockholder
Approval, the Parent Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified (a "
_Parent Change in Recommendation_ ") if the Parent Board concludes in good
faith, after having consulted with Parent's outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that as a result of Parent's receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a violation of Section 5.13 and which
constitutes a Superior Offer, the withdrawal or modification of the Parent
Board Recommendation is required in order for the Parent Board to comply with
its fiduciary obligations to Parent's stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to Parent taking any action
permitted under this Section 5.03(c), Parent shall (i) provide Company with
four (4) Business Days' prior written notice advising Company that it intends

Proposal, the information required by Section 5.13(b), (ii) during such four
(4) Business Day period, negotiate, and cause its Representatives to
negotiate, with Company in good faith (to the extent Company wishes to
negotiate) to enable Company to determine whether to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement such that it would obviate the need for the Parent
Board to effect such withdrawal or modification, and (iii) consider in good
faith any proposal by Company to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to effect such Parent Change
in Recommendation.

faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such statement
would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , _further_ , that (A) in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), any such disclosure or public statement shall

shall not affect a Parent Change in Recommendation unless specifically
permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 5.03(c).

response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest
that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv)

letter of intent or similar document or any agreement contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction.

(b) Company will promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information)
advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any
inquiry or indication of interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information relating to Company or its
Subsidiaries (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request, the
material terms thereof and copies of any written material submitted therewith)
that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period.
Company will keep Parent informed on a prompt basis in all material respects
with respect to the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request and any modification or
proposed modification thereto and shall deliver copies of any written
material submitted therewith.

  



  

(c) Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal and will
promptly request from each person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of making an Acquisition
Proposal prior to the date hereof to return or destroy (as provided in the
terms of such confidentiality agreement) all confidential
information concerning Parent, Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and promptly terminate all physical and electronic data
access previously granted to such person.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Non-Solicitation by Parent_.

  



  

(a) Beginning on the date hereof and continuing until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article VII, Parent will not and will not authorize or permit any
of its Subsidiaries or any Representative of Parent or its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, induce
or facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition
Proposal or take any action that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding Parent
or its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in response to an
Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest that could lead
to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Transaction (other than an Acceptable Parent Confidentiality
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the Parent Stockholder Approval, this Section 5.13(a) will
not prohibit Parent from furnishing nonpublic information regarding Parent
and its Subsidiaries to, entering into discussions with, any Person in
response to any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that, after
consultation with a financial advisor and outside legal counsel, the Parent
Board determines in good faith is, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a Superior Offer (and is not withdrawn) if (1) such Acquisition Proposal
did not result from a breach of this Section 5.13(a); (2) the Parent Board
concludes in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Acquisition Proposal and the
terms of this Agreement, failure to take such action would result in a breach
of its fiduciary obligations to Parent's stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements; (3) at least two (2) Business Days prior to furnishing
any such information to, or entering into discussions with, such Person,
Parent gives Company written notice of the identity of such Person, the terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies
of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements)
made thereby and of Parent's intention to furnish information to, or enter
into discussions with, such Person, and Parent receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to Parent than
the confidentiality agreement between Parent and Company and containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Parent as well
as customary "standstill" provisions (an " _Accepted Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and (4) substantially contemporaneous with furnishing any such
information to such Person, Parent furnishes such nonpublic information to
Company (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously furnished by Parent to Company). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agrees that in the event any
Representative of Parent (or its Subsidiaries), whether or not such
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Parent (or its
Subsidiaries), takes any action that, if taken by Parent (or its
Subsidiaries), would constitute a breach of this Section 5.13, the taking of
such action by such Representative will be deemed to constitute a breach of
this Section 5.13 by Parent for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Parent will promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that could
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information)
advise Company orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry
or indication of interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request, the
material terms thereof and copies of any written material submitted therewith)
that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period. Parent
will keep Company informed on a prompt basis in all material respects with
respect to the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication
of interest or request and any modification or proposed modification
thereto and shall deliver copies of any written material submitted therewith.

  



  

(c) Parent will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal and will
promptly request from each person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of making an Acquisition
Proposal prior to the date hereof to return or destroy (as provided in the
terms of such confidentiality agreement) all confidential
information concerning Parent, Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and promptly terminate all physical and electronic data
access previously granted to such person.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Subject to the following sentence, prior
to the Effective Time, Parent and Company will take all such steps as may be
required (to the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements and no-
action letters issued by the SEC) to cause any acquisition of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock and
any Milestone Shares (to the extent earned pursuant to, and in accordance
with, Section 1.12) by each individual who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. At least
thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, Company will furnish the
following information to Parent for each individual who, immediately after
the Effective Time, will become subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent: (a) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock held by such individual and expected to be
exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, (b) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such individual and
expected to be exchanged for Milestone Shares (to the extent earned pursuant
to, and in accordance with, Section 1.12), and (c) the number of other
derivative securities (if any) with respect to Company Common Stock held by
such individual and expected to be converted into shares of Parent Common
Stock or derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger or in connection with a Milestone Event (to the
extent Milestone Shares are earned pursuant to, and in accordance with,
Section 1.12).

Section 5.15 _Parent Charter Amendment_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent will file the Parent Charter Amendment with the Secretary of
State of the State of New Jersey to become effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 5.16 _Company Options; Restricted Shares_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Option
Plan, whether or not vested, will be converted into and become an option to
purchase Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "), and Parent
shall assume the Company Option Plan and the terms of the stock option
agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced (but with changes to such
documents as Parent and Company mutually agree are appropriate to reflect the
substitution of the Company Options by Parent to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock). All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company
Options assumed by Parent will thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time: (i) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for
shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Company Option assumed by Parent will be determined by
multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting number
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (iii) the
per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
each Company Option assumed by Parent will be determined by dividing (x) the
per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the
Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent; and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any Company Option
assumed by Parent will continue in full force and effect, and the term,
exercisability, method of exercise, vesting schedule, and other provisions of
such Company Option will otherwise remain unchanged; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that: (1) to the extent provided under the terms of a Company Option, such
Company Option assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 5.16(a) will,
in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate
to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Parent
Common Stock subsequent to the Effective Time; (2) the Parent Board or a
committee thereof will succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to each Company Option
assumed by Parent; (3) notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.16 to the
contrary, effective as of the Effective Time, the term of such Company Option
assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 5.16(a) will be amended to
expire on the second year anniversary of the Effective Time; and (4)
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each holder of Company
Options listed on Schedule A shall enter into a lock-up and leak-
out agreement, in form and substance attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ ,
pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the sale,
redemption, pledge and/or transfer by such holder of any shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be restricted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.16(a), the conversion of each Company Option (regardless of
whether such option qualifies as an "incentive stock option" within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code) into an option to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock will be made in a manner consistent with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.424-1, such that the conversion of a Company Option will
not constitute a "modification" of such Company Option for purposes of
Section 409A or Section 424 of the Code. It is the intention of the parties
that each Company Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify following the
Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the
Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent
such Company Option qualified as an incentive stock option prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Restricted Share that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Option
Plan will be exchanged for restricted shares of Parent Common Stock that
shall have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including
vesting terms) set forth in the applicable Company Option Plan and the
applicable Company Restricted Share agreements relating thereto, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in an amount equal to the number of
Company Restricted Shares outstanding with respect to such Company Restricted
Share award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(c) Parent shall file with the SEC, promptly after the Effective Time, a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or alternative form),
relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
Company Options or Company Restricted Shares assumed by Parent in accordance
with this Section 5.16.

  



  

Section 5.17 __Intentionally Left Blank__.

  



  

Section 5.18 _Parent Warrants; Parent Preferred Stock_.

  



  

(a) If required by any applicable Parent Warrant, promptly after the date of
this Agreement, and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days before the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver notice to the holders of such Parent
Warrants with respect to the Transactions and the rights of the holders
thereof in connection therewith, subject to the review and approval of
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld). At the Effective Time, each Parent
Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall survive the Closing and remain outstanding in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause all issued and
outstanding Parent Preferred Stock to be converted, redeemed, exchanged,
cancelled or retired such that, as of the Effective Time, there is no Parent
Preferred Stock issued or outstanding.

  



  

Section 5.19 _Allocation Certificate; Indebtedness; Invoices; Parent
Certificate_.

  



  

(a) Company will prepare and deliver to Parent at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date a certificate signed by the Chief Financial
Officer and Secretary of Company in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent
which sets forth (i) a true and complete list of the Company Stockholders
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by each such Company Stockholder and (ii) the allocation
of the Merger Consideration among the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
Merger (the " _Allocation Certificate_ ").

  



    

55

--- 

    



  

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall,
to the extent applicable, deliver to Company an accurate and complete copy
of: one or more payoff letters, each dated no more than five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, with respect to all outstanding Indebtedness of
Parent, to: (A) satisfy such Indebtedness as of the Closing; and (B)
terminate and release any Encumbrances related thereto (the " _Indebtedness
Payoff Letters_ "); and (ii) Parent Invoices with respect to all Transaction
Costs estimated to be due and payable by Parent as of the Closing Date. 

  



  

(c) Parent will prepare and deliver to Company at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date a certificate signed by the Chief Financial
Officer and Secretary of Parent in a form reasonably acceptable to Company
which sets forth the calculation of Parent Net Cash, together with reasonable
supporting detail and taking into account the Cash Contribution, if
applicable (the " _Parent Certificate_ "), which Parent Certificate shall be
subject to the reasonable review and approval of Company. Following delivery
of the Parent Certificate until the Closing, Company and its accountants
shall, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, be permitted
to discuss with Parent and its accountants the calculation of Parent Net Cash
and shall be provided complete and accurate copies of, and have reasonable
access, upon reasonable notice at reasonable times during normal business
hours, to the work papers and supporting records of Parent and its
accountants so as to allow Company and its accountants to verify the accuracy
of the Parent Net Cash.

  



  

Section 5.20 _Employees; Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(a) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall adopt or cause to
be adopted a new stock incentive plan, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and Company, pursuant to which shares of Parent Common
Stock comprising an amount equal to 15% of the fully-diluted, outstanding
equity interests of Parent immediately following the Merger will be reserved
for issuance by Parent pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms and
conditions of such stock incentive plan, to employees, directors,
consultants and other service providers of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility, and level of benefits to
participate under the benefit plans, programs, contracts or arrangements of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, Company
and its Subsidiaries) providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the
Closing (the " _Post-Closing Plans_ "), each employee of Parent, Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries who is employed by such entity on the
Closing and continues to be employed by such Entities immediately following
the Closing (" _Continuing Employees_ ") shall be credited with his or her
years of service with Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
and their respective predecessors; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, for purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to a Continuing Employee,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Post-Closing
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent and unless such conditions would have been waived or
satisfied under the employee benefit plan whose coverage is being replaced
under the Post-Closing Plan, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by a Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year in
which the Closing occurs to be taken into account under such Post-Closing
Plan with respect to the plan year in which participation in such Post-
Closing Plan begins for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for such plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Post-Closing Plan.

Section 5.21 _Company and Parent Disclosure Schedules_. Each of Company and
Parent may in its discretion, for informational purposes only, supplement the
information set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable, with respect to any matter now existing or
hereafter arising that, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, on
the date of this Agreement or that is necessary to correct any information in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
which has been rendered inaccurate thereby promptly following discovery
thereof. Any such amended or supplemented disclosure shall not be deemed to
modify the representations and warranties of Company, Parent or Merger Sub for
purposes of Section 6.02(a) and 6.03(a) of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.22 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Parties shall treat, and shall not take any Tax reporting position
inconsistent with the treatment of, the Merger as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal, state and other
relevant Tax purposes, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  



  

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that each has relied upon the advice
of its own tax advisors in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions and that none of Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, makes any representation or warranty with respect to
the tax treatment of the Merger or the Transactions, other than as expressly
set forth in Section 2.07(h) or Section 3.07(h), respectively.

  



  

Section 5.23 _Reverse Split_. If applicable, Parent shall submit to the
holders of Parent Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting a proposal
to approve and adopt the Parent Charter Amendment, which shall include a
proposal authorizing the Parent Board to effect a reverse stock split of all
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock at a reverse stock split ratio as
mutually agreed to by Parent and Company (the " _Reverse Split_ ") and within
the range approved by the holders of Parent Common Stock, which range
shall be sufficient to cause the price of Parent's Common Stock on the Nasdaq
following such Reverse Split and the Effective Time to be no less than $5.00
per share. If applicable, Parent shall cause the Reverse Split to be
implemented and take effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

enter into such Lock-up Agreements; and (b) Parent shall deliver a Lock-Up
Agreement to each of the Parent Lock-Up Signatories, which Persons are listed
on _Schedule A_ , and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such

regulations of Nasdaq, prepare and submit to Nasdaq a notification form for
the listing of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection

Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5110, to file an initial listing application for the
Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq (the " _Nasdaq Listing Application_ ") and to
cause such Nasdaq Listing Application to be conditionally approved prior to
the Effective Time. The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to
coordinate with respect to compliance with Nasdaq rules and
regulations. Parent agrees to pay all Nasdaq fees associated with the Nasdaq
Listing Application. Company will cooperate with Parent as
reasonably requested by Parent with respect to the Nasdaq Listing Application
and promptly furnish to Parent all information concerning Company and its
stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this Section 5.25.

Parent (i) audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended 2018 and
2019, if any, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement (the " _Company Audited

each interim period completed prior to Closing that would be required to be
included in the Proxy Statement or any periodic report due prior to the
Closing if Company were subject to the periodic reporting requirements
under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the " _Company Interim
Financial Statements_ "). Each of the Company Audited Financial Statements
and the Company Interim Financial Statements will be suitable for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement and prepared in accordance with GAAP as applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except in each case as
described in the notes thereto) and on that basis will present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position and the results of operations,
changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows of Company as of the dates of
and for the periods referred to in the Company Audited Financial Statements
or the Company Interim Financial Statements, as the case may be.

conditions set forth under Article VI. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments, or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect, or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation

Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  



  

Section 5.28 _Parent Spin-Off_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent may,
in its discretion, consummate the Parent Spin-Off, which shall be (if
consummated by Parent) effective immediately prior to the Closing, in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. Parent shall provide Company a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all documents and agreements
related to the Parent Spin-Off, which documents and agreements shall be
reasonably acceptable to Company. Prior to effecting the Parent Spin-Off
pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.28, Parent shall (a) seek and obtain
written agreements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Company from
all parties to Contracts that are distributed in connection with the Parent
Spin-Off releasing Parent from any and all liabilities and obligations under
such Contracts, (b) provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Company that
no material Tax will arise to Parent as a result of the Parent Spin-Off and
(c) deliver to Company a schedule, which schedule shall be reasonably
acceptable to Company, setting forth the list of Contracts and other assets
and all related liabilities and obligations to be transferred to SpinCo (if
any) or other acquiror. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.28 to the
contrary, to the extent the Cash Contribution made by Parent to SpinCo (if
any) or other acquiror would cause or would be reasonably likely to cause
Parent Net Cash to be less than the Minimum Parent Net Cash Amount as of the
Effective Time, no such Cash Contribution will be made in connection with the
Parent Spin-Off.

  



  

Section 5.29 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover statute or

action (including amending or terminating the Rights Agreement, as may be
required) to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, there shall be no rights
plan, rights agreement, "poison pill" or similar agreement or
arrangement (including, for clarity, the Rights Agreement) that is in force
and applicable to Parent or any other Acquiring Company in connection with
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.31 _Supera Purchase_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Company shall
consummate the Supera Purchase, which shall be effective immediately prior to
