independent accountants indicating the Maximum Amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii)&nbsp;a letter from Parent&#146;s counsel indicating that (A)&nbsp;Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that
the receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code or (B)&nbsp;Parent&#146;s outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code,
in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Payment to Parent. Any amount of the Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
