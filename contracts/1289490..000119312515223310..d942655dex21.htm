of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and

Time represented shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any

Company Merger Effective Time, the Company should split, combine or otherwise

then (without limiting any other rights of Parent or Merger Sub I hereunder),
the Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration shall be ratably adjusted
to reflect any such change.

Section 3.2 _Effect on Partnership Units_. At the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any action on
the part of Merger Partnership, the Partnership or the holder of any
securities thereof:

 

(a) _Partnership Merger Consideration; Conversion of Merger Partnership
Units_. Each Merger Partnership Unit outstanding immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time (other than any Merger Partnership Units
held by a Parent Subsidiary) shall automatically be converted into, and shall
be cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, without interest (the "
_Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ , that in lieu of
receiving the Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration, if, but only if, (x)
the holder of such Merger Partnership Unit has effectively made and not
revoked a valid election pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ to receive Partnership
Units in respect thereof, and (y) the issuance of such Partnership Units would
be exempt from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, then each of such holders Merger Partnership Units shall be
converted into 0.2031 Partnership Units, including the right to receive,
pursuant to  _Section 3.9_, cash in lieu of any fractional interests in
Partnership Units into which such Merger Partnership Units have been converted

entitled, Partnership Units (a " _Unit Election_ ") as follows:

 

(i) The Partnership shall prepare and deliver to Merger Partnership, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date the Proxy Statement is
mailed to the stockholders of the Company and, in any event, not later than
three (3) Business Days thereafter, and Merger Partnership shall mail to the
holders of Merger Partnership Units, a form of election, which form shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of the Company (the " _Form of Election_
"). The Form of Election may be used by each holder of Merger Partnership
Units to designate such holders election to convert all, but not less than
all, of the Merger Partnership Units held by such holder into Partnership
Units. Any such holders election to receive Partnership Units shall be deemed
to have been properly made only if Parent shall have 

 



12  received at its principal executive office, not later than 5:00 p.m., Salt
Lake City time, on the date that is three (3) Business Days before the
scheduled date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Date_ "),

state therein the date that constitutes the Election Date.

(ii) A Form of Election may be revoked by any holder of a Merger Partnership
Unit only by written notice received by Parent prior to 5:00 p.m., Salt Lake
City time, on the Election Date. In addition, all Forms of Election shall
automatically be revoked if the Partnership Merger has been abandoned.

 

(iii) The determination of Parent shall be binding as to whether or not

Parent reasonably determines that any election to receive Partnership Units
was not properly made, the Merger Partnership Units with respect to which such
election was not properly made shall be converted into Per Partnership Unit
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.2(a)_. Parent may make
such rules as are consistent with this _Section 3.2(b)_ for the
implementation of elections provided for herein as shall be
reasonably necessary or desirable to fully effect such elections.

(iv) Each holder of Merger Partnership Units, as a condition to making a Unit
Election with respect to such holders Merger Partnership Units, shall (A)

to be bound by the terms of the limited partnership agreement of the Surviving
Partnership as it will be in effect immediately following the Partnership
Merger Effective Time.

 

(v) The Company agrees to reasonably cooperate with Parent in preparing any
disclosure statement or other disclosure information to accompany the Form of
Election, including information applicable to an offering of securities exempt
from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 506 thereunder,
each of which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company.

(vi) Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Partnership

outstanding partnership unit of the Surviving Partnership.

at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, Merger Partnership should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify the Merger Partnership Units, or make a distribution in
Merger Partnership Units, or otherwise change the Merger Partnership
Units into any other securities, then (without limiting any other rights of
Parent, the Partnership or Merger Sub II hereunder), the Per Partnership Unit
Merger Consideration shall be ratably adjusted to reflect any such change.

 

Section 3.3 _Exchange Fund; Paying Agent_.

 

(a) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for (i) the payment and delivery of the Merger
Consideration, as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.2(a)_, other
than any Partnership Units to be issued in accordance with this _Article
III_ pursuant to the Unit Election, and (ii) if Parent wishes the Paying Agent
to so act, in Parents discretion, the exchange of Merger Partnership Units

13  Partnership Units in accordance with this _Article III_ pursuant to the
Unit Election (the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any such
Partnership Units referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). On or
before the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be

Section 3.4 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Procedure_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or Partnership Units, as applicable, to which the holder thereof
is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company
as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or Partnership Units, as applicable, payable in respect of
Company Common Stock or Merger Partnership Units, as applicable, previously
represented by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article
III_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Merger Partnership
Units to a Person that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company or Merger Partnership, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.4_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Closing Date to represent only the right
to receive, upon such surrender, the Per Company Common Share Merger
Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or Partnership Units,
as applicable, as contemplated by this _Section 3.4_. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(b) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Merger Partnership
Units_. On the Closing Date, holders of Company Common Stock or Merger
Partnership Units (that are converted into the right

 



14  to receive Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership
Unit Merger Consideration or Partnership Units) shall cease to be, and shall
have no rights as, stockholders of the Company or limited partners of Merger
Partnership other than the right to receive the Per Company Common Share
Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or Partnership
Units, as applicable, provided under this  _Article III_. The Per Company
Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger Consideration
or Partnership Units, as applicable, paid or delivered upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates representing Company Common Stock or Merger
Partnership Units in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be
deemed to have been paid or delivered, as the case may be, in full
satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to Company Common
Stock or Merger Partnership Units exchanged therefor.

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, and any
holders of Company Common Stock or Merger Partnership Units prior to the
Company Merger or Partnership Merger, as applicable, who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Company for payment of the Per Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per
Partnership Unit Merger Consideration or Partnership Units, as applicable.

(d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the
Partnership, the Company, Merger Partnership, the Surviving Company, the
Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, trustee,
director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect
of Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates immediately prior to
the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Company, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving Company. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Per Company
Common Share Merger Consideration and Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at
a level sufficient to make such payments.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent, and if reasonably required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the
Exchange Fund and subject to  _Section 3.4(c)_, the Surviving Company) will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration or Partnership Units, as applicable, payable in respect
thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

15 Section 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, Parent, the Partnership, the
Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or the Paying Agent (each, a "
_Payor_ "), as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause
to be deducted and withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment (and, with respect to the
Company Restricted Shares, the vesting of such Company Restricted Shares)
under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld, or caused to be deducted or withheld, by the
applicable Payor, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the applicable Payor.

 

Section 3.8 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 3.9 _Fractional Interests_. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional interests in Partnership Units shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Merger Partnership Units, and such fractional
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a unitholder of the Partnership. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of Merger Partnership Units converted pursuant to
the Partnership Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a Partnership Unit shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without
interest, in an amount equal to the product of (a) the volume weighted average
price of Parent Common Stock for the last full trading day ending immediately

(a) The Company has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis)
to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required
to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and
after January 1, 2013 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ "). Each
Company SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its
date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did
not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of
registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Company Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated,
if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared
(except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of the

 



21  Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP, including that: (i) transactions are executed only in accordance
with managements authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of the financial statements of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (iii) access to such assets is permitted
only in accordance with managements authorization; and (iv) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. The Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls, and
the Company has made available to Parent copies of any written materials
relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed
under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods
in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being
prepared, and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required
to be included in the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive
officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange
Act).

 

(d) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
_Section 6.1_ hereof, (ii) disclosed in publicly available Company SEC
Filings filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (iii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Company SEC Filings filed
with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, (iv) described in any
Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or (v) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Filings is the
subject of ongoing SEC review and the Company has not received any comments
from the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Filings since January 1,
2013 which remain unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information
request from the SEC as to any matters affecting the Company which has not
been adequately addressed. The Company has made available to Parent true and
complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC
received since January 1, 2013 through the date of this Agreement relating to
the Company SEC Filings and all written responses of the Company thereto
through the date of this Agreement. None of the Company SEC Filings is the
subject of any confidential treatment request by the Company.

supplied by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for

the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the Company Merger
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this _Section

upon information supplied to the Company by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub
I, Merger Sub II or the Partnership explicitly for use therein.

Merger Partnership) in respect of its stock, partnership interests or other
equity interests or made any actual, constructive or deemed distribution in
respect of any shares of its stock, partnership interests or other equity
interests or otherwise made any payments to equityholders in their capacity as
such.

be material to any Company Property.

(n)  _Section 4.16(n)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists (i) to the
knowledge of the Company, each of the Company Properties which are under
development as of the date hereof, and describes the status of such

30 Section 4.17 _Taxes_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authority all federal and state income Tax Returns
and other material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking into account any

Returns were complete and correct in all material respects. The Company and
each Company Subsidiary have duly paid (or there has been paid on their
behalf), or made adequate provisions for, all material Taxes required to be
paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax Return.

 

(b) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with the Companys
taxable year ended December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2014, has been
subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of
Section 856 of the Code (a " _REIT_ ") and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2015 to
the date hereof in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner
as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year that will end with the Company
Merger; and (iv) has not taken or omitted to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS or any other
Governmental Authority to its status as a REIT, and no such challenge is

income tax purposes, other than a corporation that qualifies as a

Company Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which
deficiency has not yet been settled, except for such deficiencies which are
being contested in good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect
to the assessment of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to
any Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year; (iv) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return, (v) neither

company has been since its formation treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation.

disposition of which would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section

which have not been previously paid, and (ii) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes other
than (x) in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice,
or (y) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with sales of property.
No event has occurred, and

 



31  no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(g) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the
payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation, withholding
of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446 and 3402 of the Code or
similar provisions under any state and foreign Laws) and have duly and

or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

 

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 4.17(h)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no Company Tax Protection Agreements (as defined below) in
force or effect, and no person has raised in writing, or to the knowledge of
the Company threatened to raise, a claim against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for any breach of any Company Tax Protection Agreements. As

agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party pursuant

and for which adequate reserves are being maintained (if such reserves are
required pursuant to GAAP).

(j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has requested, has received
or is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Authority or has

to any Taxes.

Letter, there are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar
arrangements with respect to or involving the Company or any Company

Subsidiary shall be bound by any such Tax allocation agreements or similar
arrangements or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of
periods prior to the Closing Date.

 

(l) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (A) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return or (B)

two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution
which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of
related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



32 (o) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary: (i) has agreed to make any

Subsidiary that would result in a material increase in the amount of any
material Tax to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be subject.

(q) No written power of attorney that has been granted by the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries (other than to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary) currently is in force with respect to any matter relating to

respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on substantially
similar terms prior to the date of such cancellation.

any creditor of any Excluded Asset Company.

 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 4.25(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, as of the date hereof and upon the consummation of the Excluded Asset
Transactions, each Excluded Asset Company (i) is and will be Solvent, (ii) has
and will have sufficient capital for carrying on its business and (iii) is and
will be able to pay its debts as they mature. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to a particular date, that on such date
(A) the present fair market value (or present fair saleable value) of the
assets of each Excluded Asset Company is not less than the total amount
required to pay the liabilities of such Excluded Asset Company on its total
existing debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as they
become absolute and matured; (B) each Excluded Asset Company is able to pay
its debts and other liabilities, contingent obligations and commitments as

Asset Company is otherwise insolvent under the standards set forth in
applicable Laws.

 

(e) Each of the Excluded Asset Sellers had as of the date of the Excluded
Asset Purchase Agreements and continues to have the requisite organizational
power and authority to execute and deliver the Excluded Asset Purchase
Agreements, and has the requisite organizational power and authority to
perform its obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery of the

 



34  Excluded Asset Purchase Agreements by each of the Excluded Asset Sellers,
and the consummation by each of the Excluded Asset Sellers of the transactions
contemplated thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
organizational action, and no other organizational proceedings on the part of
each of the Excluded Asset Sellers is necessary to authorize the Excluded
Asset Purchase Agreements or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby. No vote of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock

the Company or any Company Subsidiary is required in connection with
the execution or delivery of the Excluded Asset Purchase Agreements by any of
the Excluded Asset Sellers or in connection with the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated thereby. Each of the Excluded Asset Purchase
Agreements has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Excluded Asset
Sellers and, assuming the Excluded Asset Purchase Agreements were duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the other parties thereto, constitutes a
legally valid and binding obligation of each of the Excluded Asset Sellers,
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 

(f) The execution and delivery of the Excluded Asset Purchase Agreements by
any of the Excluded Asset Sellers does not, and the performance of the
Excluded Asset Purchase Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby by any of the Excluded Asset Sellers will not, (i)
conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Charter or Company
Bylaws or any equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary,
(ii) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound or (iii) require any consent or approval under, result in
any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or result in the triggering of
any payments pursuant to, or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to
others any right of termination, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit or other legally binding obligation to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, except as to clauses (ii)
and (iii), respectively, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The execution and delivery of the Excluded Asset Purchase Agreements by any of
the Excluded Asset Sellers did not, and the performance of the Excluded Asset
Purchase Agreements by the Excluded Asset Sellers will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority.

representations and warranties contained in this  _Article IV_, neither the
Company, Merger Partnership, any of the other Company Subsidiaries nor any

material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
promptly inform the other party hereto, and an appropriate amendment or

that Parent deems to be reasonably necessary, so long as such access does not
unduly interfere with the Companys ordinary conduct of business.

(b) Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates to
hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant
to this _Section 6.4_, in confidence to the extent required by and in
accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent agree to give prompt written notice to the
other upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which (i) would be reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or (ii) if unremedied by
the Company Merger Effective Time, would cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein, and
to use its reasonable best efforts to prevent or promptly to remedy the same;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations and warranties of any party or relieve any party of any
breach of any such representation or warranty or affect the remedies available
to the party receiving notice hereunder.

 

Section 6.5 _Company Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.5_, during the Interim
Period, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their officers and directors, managers or
equivalent, and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly
through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition
Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ "), (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Third Party any non-public information in
connection with, or knowingly facilitate in any way any effort by, any Third
Party in furtherance of any Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, (iii)
approve or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.5_) providing for or
relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5_, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may,
directly or indirectly, through any Representative, in response to an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party
made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from a breach
of this _Section 6.5_) (i) furnish non-public information to such Third
Party (and such Third Partys Representatives) making a Company Acquisition
Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing
such information, the Company receives from the Third Party an executed
confidentiality agreement on customary terms no more favorable to such Person
than the Confidentiality Agreement (such confidentiality agreement, an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (B) any non-public information
concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to such
Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, be
provided to Parent prior to or simultaneously with providing it to such Third
Party), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Third Party
(and such Third Partys Representatives) with respect to the Company
Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii): (x) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, and
(y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal

 



44  counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each
of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), such Company Acquisition Proposal was
not solicited in violation of this _Section 6.5._

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 48
hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any
Third Party that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has
made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any Inquiry from any Person seeking
to have discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a possible
Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed
in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Third Party making the
Company Acquisition Proposal, request or Inquiry and the material terms and
conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposals, Inquiries, proposals or
offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation
or correspondence). The Company shall also promptly, and in any event within
48 hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions
or negotiations concerning any Company Acquisition Proposal or provides
nonpublic information or data to any Person in accordance with this _Section
6.5(c)_ and keep the other party informed of the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including
by providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating
thereto.

 

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in
any manner adverse to Parent (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Recommendation,
(ii) approve, adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iv) fail to publicly recommend against
any Company Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days of the request
of Parent or reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days
(any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this
_Section 6.5(d)_, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve,
adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to
approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the
Company to enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
_Section 6.5_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board shall be permitted to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change (x) upon the incurrence of an Intervening Event, that, in the good
faith determination of the Company Board, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors duties under applicable Law, or (y) if the Company Board
(i) has received an unsolicited _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal (that
did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_) that, in the good faith
determination of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having
complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be
offered by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)_, and such Company Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn, and (ii) determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

(e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted under clause (y) of _Section 6.5(d)_
unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") to Parent that the Company intends to take such action,
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and describing the
material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (it being understood that
such material terms shall include the identity of the Third Party), (ii)
during the three (3) Business Day period following Parents receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal, and (iii) following the end of the three (3) Business Day
period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into
account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in
response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior
Proposal giving

 



45  rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal, and the Company shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 6.5(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
references to the three (3) Business Day period above shall then be deemed to
be references to a two (2) Business Day period.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any
applicable Company Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Company Recommendation to the Companys stockholders in favor of the Company
Merger shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(g) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries, and
its and their officers and directors, managers or equivalent, and other
Representatives to (i) immediately cease any existing discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) take such action as is
necessary to enforce any confidentiality or "standstill" provisions or
provisions of similar effect to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a beneficiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
be permitted to waive any "standstill" provision or provision of similar
effect for the limited purpose of allowing a Third Party to submit a Company
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause all Third Parties who have been furnished confidential information
regarding the Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions
regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal within the six (6) months prior to
the date of this Agreement to promptly return or destroy such information (to
the extent that the Company is entitled to have such information returned or
destroyed).

 

(h) Nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall (i) permit the Company to terminate
this Agreement or (ii) affect any other obligation of the Company under this
Agreement. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Company Acquisition Proposal other than the Company Merger prior to the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer for (or
expression by a Third Party that it is considering or may engage in), whether
in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (A) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (B) any sale,
lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of equity interests,

(20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-value basis, (C) any
issue, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, joint venture, business combination, share exchange or any
similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase,
or securities convertible into, such securities) representing twenty percent
(20%) or more of the voting power of the Company, (D) any tender offer or
exchange offer in which any Person or "group" (as such term is defined
in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall seek to acquire
beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class of voting
securities of the Company, (E) any recapitalization, restructuring,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar type of transaction with respect to
the Company in which a Third Party shall acquire beneficial ownership of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class of voting
securities of the Company or (F) any transaction which is similar in form,
substance or purpose to any of the foregoing

 



46  transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Company Acquisition
Proposal" shall not include the Company Merger, the Partnership Merger, the
Excluded Asset Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition
Proposal (except that, for purposes of this definition, the references in the
definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" to "twenty percent (20%)" shall
be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made by a Third Party on terms that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and any other aspects of the transaction
described in such proposal, including the identity of the Person making such
proposal, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation, as well as any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise, to be
(A) more favorable to the Company and the Companys stockholders (solely in
their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms proposed.

(j) References in this  _Section 6.5_ to "Company Board" shall include a
duly authorized committee thereof.

Section 6.6 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including  _Section 6.5_), each of the Company and Parent shall and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other

taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental

which is set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(collectively, the " _Required Consents_ "), (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment
under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and

Subsidiaries, respectively, to give) any notices to Third Parties, and each of
Parent and the Company shall use, and cause each of their respective
Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any Third Party
consents not covered by _Section 6.6(a)_ that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Mergers, including consents or notices required by
any telephone company or related to website advertising. Each of the parties
hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any
required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding
to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly informing
the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each
other with copies of all material correspondence, 

 



47  filings or communications between either party and any Governmental
Authority with respect to this Agreement. To the extent practicable, and

Representatives of the other party to participate in meetings (whether by
telephone or in person) with such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from any Third Party pursuant
to this _Section 6.6(b)_ shall not be a condition to the obligations of
Parent.

Section 6.7 _Excluded Asset Transactions_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the other Excluded Asset Sellers and
the Excluded Asset Companies to, cause the Excluded Asset Closings to occur
in full on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
_Section 6.1_, the Company shall not, and shall cause the other Excluded

any amendment or modification to, or any waiver under, or any termination of

their respective rights under the Excluded Asset Purchase Agreements or any
agreement, document or instrument contemplated thereby or executed in
connection therewith, in each case without the prior written consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned (it
being understood that any consent provided by Parent hereunder shall not and
shall not be deemed to affect Parents closing conditions or constitute a
waiver thereof).

(c) In the event that any Excluded Asset Purchase Agreement is terminated by
any other party thereto, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to, and to cause the other Excluded Asset Sellers and the Excluded Asset
Companies to, enter into one or more substitute purchase agreements that are

Purchase Agreement_ ") and shall provide reasonable notice to Parent, and keep
Parent reasonably apprised of the status and expectations related to any
Alternative Excluded Asset Purchase Agreement.

 

(d) In the event that the Company and the other Excluded Asset Sellers enter
into any Alternative Excluded Asset Purchase Agreement, the term "Excluded
Asset Purchase Agreements" shall be deemed to include any Alternative Excluded
Asset Purchase Agreement to the extent then in effect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the obligations set forth in  _Section 6.7(a)_
and _Section 6.7(b)_ shall apply to any Alternative Excluded Asset Purchase
Agreement.

Section 6.8  _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by
it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions would reasonably be expected to be incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with
or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement.

 



48 (c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any Action commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such party or any of

relate to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to reasonably
participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with

parties consent, issue such press release or make such public statement or
filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of any party
hereto. If for any reason it is not practicable to consult with the other
party before making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, then the party making such statement
shall not make a statement that is inconsistent with public statements or
filings to which the other party had previously consented; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such consultation and consent shall not be required with
respect to any release, communication or announcement to the extent permitted
by _Section 6.5_.

 

Section 6.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall provide exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for
each Indemnitee, which is at least as favorable in scope and amount to such
Indemnitee as the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided to such Indemnitee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time in the Company Charter
or the Company Bylaws or each of the Company Subsidiaries respective articles
or certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents), as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_
that such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses covers
actions or omissions at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
including all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.10(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Company Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Company Merger Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from
any fees, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such Action arises out of or pertains to (x) any
action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity
as a director, officer, partner or member of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Mergers; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such Action the reasonable expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses incurred by any Indemnitee in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to indemnification) of any
Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Company (i)
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is
prohibited by

 



49  applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee shall promptly refund to Parent
or the Surviving Company the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced
pursuant hereto.

 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policies (accurate and complete
copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) in effect on the date
hereof (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not less than
six (6) years after the Closing Date;  _provided_ that the Surviving Company
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms no less advantageous in any material respect to such former
directors or officers so long as such substitution does not result in gaps or
lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time; _provided further_ that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Company be required to pay annual premiums in the aggregate of more
than an amount equal to 250% of the current annual premiums paid by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "), to maintain or procure
insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided further_ that if the amount of
the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving Company shall procure
and maintain for such six-year period as much coverage as can be
reasonably obtained for the Maximum Premium. Parent shall have the option to
cause coverage to be extended under the Companys DandO Insurance by obtaining a
six-year "tail" policy or policies on terms and conditions no less
advantageous in any material respect than the Companys existing DandO
Insurance, subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos above in this
_Section 6.10(c)_, and such "tail" policy or policies shall satisfy the
provisions of this _Section 6.10(c)_.

(d) Any Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
6.10_, upon learning of any claim, action, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify the Surviving Company thereof in
writing; _provided_ that the failure to so notify the Surviving Company shall
not affect the indemnification obligations of the Surviving Company under
this _Section 6.10_, except to the extent such failure to notify prejudices
the Surviving Company.

 

(e) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.10_ applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_. The provisions of this _Section 6.10_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives.

 

(f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as
applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.10_.

 

Section 6.11 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _REIT Matters_. The Company shall take all actions, and refrain from
taking all actions, as are necessary to ensure that the Company (i) will
qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its
current taxable year and any other taxable year that includes the Closing
Date, and (ii) will not become liable for U.S. federal income Tax
under Section 857(b) or 4981 of the Code. During the Interim Period, the
Company shall accommodate all reasonable requests of Parent with respect to
maintenance of the Companys REIT status, including for the Companys 2015
taxable year and, if applicable, 2016 taxable year.

(b) _Mitigation of Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall, upon written request,
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(c) _Tax Returns_. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed (in each case, including applicable
extensions) all Tax Returns for the Company and each Company Subsidiary
required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall
pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. Any such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the historical Tax accounting practices
of the Company (except as may be required under applicable Tax Law). The
Company shall provide to Parent copies of such Tax Returns at least five (5)
days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns

 



50  (including applicable extensions) and the Company shall consider in good
faith any and all reasonable comments of Parent with respect to such Tax
Returns.

 

(d) _FIRPTA Certificate_. On the Closing Date, prior to the Company Merger,
the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub I a duly executed certificate of non-
foreign status, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form of the
sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

 

Section 6.12 _Distributions_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, the Company may make distributions reasonably
required for the Company to maintain its status as a REIT under the Code or
to avoid the payment of income or excise tax under Sections 857 or 4981 of the
Code.

(b) If the Company declares distributions pursuant to _Section 6.12(a)_ or
any other provision of this Agreement (including _Section 6.1(d)_) in excess
of the distributions permitted under _Section 6.1(c)(iii)(B)_, the Per
Company Common Share Merger Consideration and Per Partnership Unit Merger
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the per share amount of
such excess distributions.

 

Section 6.13 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Effective immediately following the Closing, the employment of each
Company Employee listed in _Section 6.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be terminated by the Surviving Company (each such employee, a "
_Terminated Employee_ "); _provided_ that Parent and the Surviving Company
shall be liable for all termination-related payments or benefits set forth in
_Section 6.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter to be paid to such
Terminated Employees as a result of such terminations.

 

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall (i) use their reasonable
best efforts to maintain good employee relations, (ii) use their reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the Company Employees (other than the Terminated
Employees) continue to be employed through the Closing Date, and (iii) not
engage in any activity intended to discourage any Company Employee from
continuing employment with Parent or the Surviving Company following the
Closing.

(c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after
the Company Merger Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Company
Merger Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled, before the Company Merger Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents and domestic partners
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Company Merger Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



51 (d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time.

(e) The Company may establish a cash retention program with a retention pool
in the aggregate amount of up to $1,500,000, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, with any retention awards from such retention pool to
be paid upon the 60th day following the Company Merger Effective Time. The
retention awards contemplated by this _Section 6.13(e)_ shall be allocated to
the Company Employees (other than the Terminated Employees) identified, and in
the amounts determined, by mutual agreement of the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company and the Chief Executive Officer of Parent. If a retention award or
portion thereof is forfeited by a participant prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or his designees)
may reallocate the retention award (or unpaid portion thereof) to existing
employees or new hires of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, but only
with the prior written consent of Parent, subject to the provisions of this 
_Section 6.13(e)_.

(f) Prior to making any material written communications to the Company
Employees pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication (
_provided_ that Parent shall review and comment promptly), and Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
shall have the right to pay annual bonus awards to the Company Employees in
respect of fiscal year 2015 upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time if the Company Merger Effective Time occurs
prior to the end of fiscal year 2015 and (ii) following completion of fiscal
year 2015, with such payments to be based upon the greater of (x) actual
performance (linearly extrapolating in good faith the Companys performance as
of the Closing Date through the end of fiscal year 2015 if the Company
Merger Effective Time occurs prior to the end of fiscal year 2015) and (y)
target performance. _Section 6.13(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth the annual bonus awards paid in respect of fiscal year 2014 and the
estimated full year annual bonus awards expected to be paid in respect of
fiscal year 2015 (linearly extrapolating in good faith the Companys
performance as of the date of this Agreement through the end of fiscal year
2015).

 

(h) Nothing in this _Section 6.13_ or any other provision of this Agreement
shall (i) confer upon any Company Employee any right to continue in the
employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent,
or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Company Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause,
except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement
between Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent and the
Company Employee, (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement or
(iii) limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company, the
Surviving Partnership and their subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate in
accordance with its terms any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.13_
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any other Person,
including any current or former director, officer, employee or other service
provider of the Company or its Affiliates or any participant in any Company
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement
(or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 6.14 _Termination of Plans and Agreements_. Unless otherwise notified
by Parent in writing, the Company shall and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to take all actions necessary to terminate, and shall cause to be
terminated, effective immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
(a) any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code, (b) the Company Stock Plan, such that no further awards shall be
granted thereunder, and (c) any and all transactions that would be required
to be

 



52  disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC (except,
for purposes hereof, there shall be no dollar threshold of $120,000
or otherwise) (the " _Affiliate Transactions_ ") (other than those set forth
in _Section 6.14_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) that have liabilities or
obligations remaining in whole or in part after the Company Merger Effective
Time, in each case without any further liability or obligation of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Company thereunder. In connection with clause (c)
above, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
other party or parties to each such Affiliate Transaction a release in favor
of Parent, the Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates from any and
all liabilities or obligations arising out of such Affiliate Transaction.

 

Section 6.15 _Resignations_. Upon the written request of Parent, (a) the
Company shall cause any or all of the directors (or persons occupying similar
positions in any limited liability company or other entity) and/or officers of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary to resign or be removed or, as to
officers, to resign or be terminated, effective as of the Closing, and (b) if
the Company or any of its affiliated entities has the right to appoint any
director (or person occupying a similar position in any limited liability
company or other entity), or to cause the resignation or termination of any
officer of any other entity in which the Company (directly or indirectly)
owns an equity interest, the Company shall cause, effective as of the Closing,
such director to resign or be removed and/or such officer to resign or be
terminated.

 

Section 6.16 _Cooperation_.

 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise directed by
Parent, all Indebtedness of the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall be
repaid or otherwise terminated on the Closing Date. In anticipation thereof,
at Parents request, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, (i) use its reasonable best efforts to deliver all
notices and take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to
facilitate the redemption, defeasance or payoff of all Indebtedness of the
Company, and the release of all Liens securing such Indebtedness, and (ii)
provide such assistance with any debt financing (the " _Debt Financing_ ") as
is reasonably requested by Parent related to debt obtained by Parent to pay
the Merger Consideration and other amounts due by Parent in connection with
the Mergers, including any expenses related thereto, and the refinancing of
any existing credit agreements of which Parent is a party ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such requested assistance does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary). Such
assistance shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (A) delivery
to Parent and its current or potential lenders of any financial information
pertaining to the Company and Company Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to
obtain such Debt Financing; (B) participation by the Companys senior
management and Representatives in the negotiation, execution and delivery of
any Debt Financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent; (C)
taking such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or its current or

conditions precedent to obtaining such Debt Financing; and (D) causing
its independent auditors and other Representatives to cooperate with the Debt
Financing. The Company further agrees to cooperate with Parent in obtaining
such title insurance as Parent or any current or potential lender in
connection with the Debt Financing may reasonably request. The Company and
Parent shall work together in good faith and pursue with their reasonable best
efforts to cause the release of any exceptions to title to any of the Company
Owned Properties as may be reasonably unacceptable to Parent or any current
or potential lender in connection with the Debt Financing.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees that (i) the effectiveness
of any definitive documentation executed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries shall be subject to the consummation of the Closing, (ii) this
_Section 6.16_ shall not require the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any
of their Affiliates to (A) agree to any contractual obligation relating to any
proposed Debt Financing that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
Closing and that does not terminate without any liability to the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates upon the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, (B) pay any commitment or other
similar fee, reimburse any expenses, provide any indemnities or incur
or assume any obligations in connection with any Debt Financing, or (C) take
any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate the
Companys or any Company Subsidiarys respective 

 



53  organizational or governing documents, (iii) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries may share non-public information with respect to the Company and
its businesses that Parent or its Affiliates may share with its current or
potential lenders, provided that the recipients of such information agree to
customary confidentiality arrangements, (iv) none of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Company shall be deemed breached or violated
by any action taken by the Company or any Company Subsidiary at the request of
Parent or any of Parents current or potential lenders pursuant to this
_Section 6.16_, (v) Parent shall promptly, upon request of the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of their
Representatives, including attorneys fees, in connection with any action
taken by any of them at the request of Parent or their current or potential
lenders pursuant to, and in accordance with this _Section 6.16_ ( _provided_
, that the Company shall have given prior written notice to Parent of
the nature and estimated amount of any such fees and expenses that it
expected to incur), (vi) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses
(including attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and
any information used in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company and any Company Subsidiary) and all other
actions taken by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives taken at Parents request pursuant to this _Section 6.16_,
except to the extent finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to have arisen from the Companys, any Company Subsidiarys or their
respective Representatives fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct,
and (vii) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
its efforts to arrange and consummate any Debt Financing.

 

(c) To assist Parent in arranging for the continuation of existing insurance
coverage for the Companys tenants following the Closing, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to facilitate discussions between the existing tenant insurers and
Parent with respect to the continuation of the existing insurance policies
and policy renewal programs following the Closing. Such assistance shall
include the provision to Parent by the Company and its current and former
third party administrators of the tenant insurance programs of copies of the
master policies, loss histories and premiums, historical policy sales,
current insurance certificate holders and detail on administrative costs, and
other information reasonably necessary or advisable for Parent to obtain a
substitute master policy and program for tenant insurance coverage following
the Closing.

Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by Parent within two (2) Business Days of such termination. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

 

(i) under no circumstance shall the Company be required to pay both the
Termination Fee and the Expense Amount, or be required to pay the Termination
Fee or the Expense Amount, as applicable, on more than one occasion; and

 



58 (ii) the Company shall not be required to pay under any circumstance any
amount in excess of the Termination Fee or the Expense Amount, as applicable,
subject to the provisions of _Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3(c)_.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Payment is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section
8.3_, the Company shall pay Parent its Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%)
for the period from the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law. 

(d) (i) If the Company is required to pay to Parent a Termination Payment,
such Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment
is required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow account designated in
accordance with this _Section 8.3(d)_. In the event that the Company
is obligated to pay to Parent the Termination Payment, the amount payable to
Parent in any tax year of Parent shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the
Termination Payment and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be
paid to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of
Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and Parent has
$2,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income) (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), in each case, as determined by
Parents independent accountants, plus (B) in the event Parent receives either
(x) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that Parent has received
a ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (y) an
opinion from Parents outside counsel as described below in this _Section
8.3(d)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Payment less the
amount payable under clause (A) above.

(ii) To secure the Companys obligation to pay these amounts, the Company
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Termination Payment
with an escrow agent selected by Parent on such terms (subject to this
_Section 8.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and
the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination
Payment pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the
Company is obligated to pay to Parent such amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_
by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination
Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i)
a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the Maximum Amount,
in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii) a
letter from Parents counsel indicating that (A) Parent received a ruling from
the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment should
either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B) Parents
outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt
by Parent of the Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying
Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release
the remainder of the Termination Payment to Parent. Any amount of the
Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall
be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.3(d)_; _provided_ that the
obligation of the Company to pay the unpaid portion of the Termination Payment
shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years
from the date of this Agreement.

 



59 Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval and prior to the Company Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes
the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this
Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law
or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further approval
of such stockholders, or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under
applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)
subject to the proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement
or condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Merger
Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or the Partnership in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder.

 

Section 8.6 _Fees, Costs and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated.

 

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to Tax,
" _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in attempting to minimize the
amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Company Merger Effective Time,
the Surviving Company or the Surving Partnership, as applicable, shall pay or
cause to be paid all Transfer Taxes.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Appendix or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article
or Section of, or an Appendix or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine

 



61  and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in
any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a Person
are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All references to "dollars"
or "$" refer to currency of the United States of America.

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto
(except to the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership).

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
schedules, annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for the provisions of _Section 6.10_. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
harm, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that one or more parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of a party hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with the
Agreements specified terms or otherwise breach(es) such provisions.
Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties, or any of
them, shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent and/or remedy a breach of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent a breach or breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with the
request for or grant of any such order or injunction.

 



62 Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Actions (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub
II, the Partnership, the Company or Merger Partnership in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of
the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland,
except that the laws of the State of Delaware (including the provisions of the
DLLCA and the DRULPA applicable to the Partnership Merger) will apply to the
Partnership Merger.

 

Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) irrevocably submits to and agrees to
be subject to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Maryland and/or the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, for the
purpose of any Action (whether based in contract, tort or otherwise), directly
or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions
of the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement thereof, (ii) irrevocably agrees that all such claims or any such
Action may and shall be brought before, and determined by, only a state or
federal court sitting in or for the State of Maryland with subject matter
jurisdiction over such claim(s) or Action(s), (iii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and (iv) agrees that it will not
(except for a suit on the judgment as expressly permitted by _Section
9.11(c)_) bring any claim or Action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the U.S.
District Court for the District of Maryland or a Maryland state court.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other Action relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such party and
nothing in this _Section 9.11_ shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Partnership, the Company
and Merger Partnership agrees that a final judgment in any Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law.

Section 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. Each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in any Action or proceeding, or
with respect to any claim or counterclaim (whether based in contract, tort or
otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or the actions of the
parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement thereof. Each of the parties hereto certifies and acknowledges
that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of Action, proceeding or counterclaim, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver, (b) each such party understands and has considered the implications of
this waiver, (c) each such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each
such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 9.12_.

 

Section 9.13 _Tax Advice_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the
Partnership or their respective advisors, on the one hand, nor the Company,
Merger Partnership or their respective advisors, on the other hand, make any
representations or warranties to the other regarding the Tax treatment of the
Mergers or any other

  



63  transaction contemplated hereunder, except as explicitly stated in this
Agreement or the documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and each of
the parties acknowledges that it is relying solely on its own Tax advisors in
connection with this Agreement.
