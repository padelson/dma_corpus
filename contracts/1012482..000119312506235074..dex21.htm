WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have
approved, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _
_Delaware Law__ "), this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement,
each of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company are entering into
a Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy in substantially the form attached

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows: ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _ _Merger__
"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company

referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__."

1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the " _
_Certificate of Merger__ ") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger)
being the " _ _Effective Time__ ") on the Closing Date. The closing of the
Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall take place at the offices of Baker and
McKenzie LLP, Two Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California, at a time and
date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the
second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived at the Closing), or at such other time, date and location
as the parties hereto agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to herein as the " _ _Closing Date__." " _ _Business Day__ " shall
mean each day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which Parent

or San Francisco, California, are authorized or obligated by law or executive
order to close.

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, obligations, claims, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, obligations, claims,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

_CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS_

_OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

2.1 _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical
to the certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub (the " _ _Charter__ ")
attached hereto as Exhibit B (as the same may be amended as necessary to
comply with Section 7.13(a)), until thereafter amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law, subject to Section 7.13(a) of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Netopia,
Inc.". After the Effective Time, the authorized capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation shall consist of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share.

2.2 _The By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company in effect
at the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be
identical to the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _ _By-Laws__ "), until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to Section 7.13(a) of this
Agreement.



 

2 ARTICLE III

_OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS_

_OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

3.1 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the By-Laws, and the Board of Directors of the Company shall take
all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to give effect to the
foregoing.

3.2 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and the By-Laws.

ARTICLE IV

_CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_

4.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or any
holder of shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of
Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _ _Company Common
Stock__ ") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or indirect
Subsidiaries of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section
4.2_, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled
in accordance with _Section 4.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter
defined)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive $7.00 in cash per share,
without interest (the " _ _Merger Consideration__ "). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Section 4.1(c)_ upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 4.2_, without
interest (or in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights contemplated by
Section 4.6 hereof).



 

3 (d) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made
for issuances of shares of Company Common Stock (or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock) that
occur in the ordinary course of the Companys business pursuant to the
exercise of Company Stock Options described as outstanding in Section 5.2 in
accordance with the applicable terms of the Company Stock Options or for
issuances of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the 2005 ESPP.

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger, and Company Stock Options for the Option Payments, are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent appointed by Parent
and reasonably approved by the Company prior to the date hereof (the " _
_Exchange Agent__ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this
Section 4.2, cash in an amount equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, (exclusive of any shares
to be cancelled pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) (the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "), plus
any cash necessary to pay the Option Payments pursuant to Section 4.3(b).
Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the Exchange Agent, such cash
shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and the Option Holders entitled
to receive the Option Payments and shall not be used for any other purposes;
provided, however, any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(c), Section 4.3 and, if any, Section
4.4, shall be promptly returned to Parent. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent provided that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, provided that no such investments
shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant
to this Article IV. 



 

4 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _ _Certificate__ "), and to each Option Holder from which
Parent (or agent thereof) received prior to the Closing Date an Option Consent
pursuant Section 4.3(b), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
as reasonably approved by the Company and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of (A) the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto or (B) the agreements representing the grant of
such Company Stock Option (each, an " _ _Option Agreement__ ") (or other
reasonably acceptable evidence of surrender of such Company Stock Option as
required by the Exchange Agent) in exchange for the Option Payments payable
with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Option Agreement (or
effective affidavit of loss required by Section 4.2(g) in lieu thereof) for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Option Agreement shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration or Option
Payment that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions
of this Article IV, after giving effect to any required withholding taxes
pursuant to Section 4.2(f) and Section 4.3(b) hereof, and the Certificate or
Option Agreement so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates or Option Agreements. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, it will be a condition of payment of the Merger Consideration
that the surrendered Certificate be properly endorsed, with signatures
guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment will pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificate or such Person will establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 4.2, each Certificate or Option Agreement (or
effective affidavit of loss required by Section 4.2(g) in lieu thereof) shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Section 4.2 or the Option Payment as contemplated by Section 4.3(b). For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean an individual,
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of
the Surviving Corporation other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section
4.2(b) and Section 4.2(g) (or in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights
contemplated by Section 4.6 hereof) and any dividend or distribution with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Certificates
with a record date prior to the Closing Date. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article IV.



 

5 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock two hundred
seventy (270) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any former holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously
complied with this  _Section 4.2_ shall be entitled to receive only from
Parent payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration, without interest.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ "), or
any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant
to this Agreement in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate.

4.3 _Company Options_.

(a) Not less than thirty (30) days before the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide written notice to each holder (an " _ _Option Holder__ ") of a Company
Stock Option (as defined in _Section 5.2(a)_) that is outstanding as of the
date of such notice that (i) such Option Holder may exercise his or her
Company Stock Options, whether or not then vested or exercisable (it being
understood that any such exercises of Company Stock Options that are not
vested or exercisable as of the date of the Option Holders exercise shall
only be effective immediately prior to the Effective Time), and (ii) each
Company Stock Option, to the extent unexercised by the Closing Date, shall
thereafter be terminated and shall no longer be exercisable. To the extent an
Option Holder exercises his or her Company Stock Options prior to the
Effective Time, such Option Holder shall thereafter be a holder of Company
Common Stock and shall receive in exchange therefor (other than with respect
to Dissenting Shares) the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 4.1(c)_.



 

6 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 4.3(a)_, in lieu of an
Option Holder exercising his or her Company Stock Options, such Option Holder
may choose to consent to the cancellation, effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, of each of his or her outstanding Company Stock Options in
consideration for a cash payment (the " _ _Option Payment__ ") in respect of
such cancellation in an amount (if any) equal to (i) the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
held by such Option Holder, whether or not then vested or exercisable, and
(y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
_minus_ (ii) all applicable Taxes required to be withheld by the Company. In
order to elect to receive the Option Payment, an Option Holder must execute
and return a signed agreement (the " _ _Option Consent__ ") to Parent (or
agent thereof) prior to the Closing Date. The Option Payment shall be paid by
the Exchange Agent as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date, subject to receipt by the Exchange Agent of all necessary documents as
required by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_). The Company
agrees to take any and all actions necessary (including the adoption of
resolutions by the Company Board and any other action reasonably requested by
Parent) to approve and effectuate the foregoing.

(c) Each Company Stock Option not exercised prior to the Closing Date pursuant
to _Section 4.3(a)_, or for which an Option Consent is not received by
Parent (or agent thereof) prior to the Closing Date pursuant to _Section
4.3(b)_, shall be terminated at the Effective Time, shall no longer be
exercisable and shall not be entitled to any payment in connection with the
Merger.

4.4 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall terminate its 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended
(the " _ _2005 ESPP__ "), and shall cause all purchase rights then outstanding
under the 2005 ESPP to be terminated in exchange for (a) a return by the
Company to each participant in the 2005 ESPP of his or her accumulated
payroll deductions, plus (b) a payment to each participant in the 2005 ESPP
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
could be purchased by the participants accumulated payroll deductions (
limited however to the amount of payroll deductions that does not exceed the
dollar limitation set forth in section 8(b) of the 2005 ESPP) as of the
earlier of the next purchase date or the Closing Date, based on the purchase
price per share (determined in accordance with the terms of the 2005 ESPP) and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the purchase price
per share (determined in accordance with the terms of the 2005 ESPP) of
Company Common Stock, minus all applicable Taxes required to be withheld by
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Effective Time occurs after
the end of the accumulation period (as defined in the 2005 ESPP) in which the
date of this Agreement occurs, the purchase price per share shall be
determined in accordance with the 2005 ESPP as of the last business day of
such accumulation period and the appropriate number of shares shall be issued
in accordance with the 2005 ESPP at least one business day prior to the
Effective Time, and the Company shall immediately thereafter terminate the
2005  



 

7  ESPP prior to the Effective Time. In addition, and notwithstanding any other
provisions above to the contrary, the Company shall take all actions
with respect to the 2005 ESPP as are necessary to assure that (x)
participation in the 2005 ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were
participants on the date of this Agreement, (y) such participants may not
increase their payroll deduction elections or purchase elections from those
in effect on the date of this Agreement, and (z) there shall not be any
additional 2005 ESPP Offering Period or Accumulation Period as defined in the
2005 ESPP commencing following the date of this Agreement.

4.5 _Actions by the Company_. Except as contemplated by Section 4.3, the
Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that from and
after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation will not be bound by any
options, rights, awards or arrangements to which the Company is a party which
would entitle any Person, other than Parent or Merger Sub, to beneficially
own shares of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or receive any payments
(other than as set forth in Section 4.3) in respect of such options, rights,
awards or arrangements.

4.6 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand
and properly demands (and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such demand)
appraisal rights under Section 262 of Delaware Law (collectively, the " _
_Dissenting Shares__ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law, including the right
to receive payment of the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 4.6(a)_, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then,
as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the Certificate representing such shares in accordance with
Section 4.2.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in any
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, negotiate with
any holder of Company Common Stock the terms of any payment, or make any
payment, with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any
such demands, and the Company shall not communicate with any holder of Company
Common Stock with respect to such demands, without prior consultation with
Parent, except for communications directed to the Companys stockholders
generally or as required by Law.

9 (d) Except as set forth on Section 5.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, owns all
Subsidiaries and Investments free and clear of all liens, pledges, security

respect to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, any entity,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms voting power to elect

Agreement in a timely manner and in accordance with this Agreement, or (Y)
the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, operations,
properties, business, assets (including intangible assets), or liabilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that none of the following, in and of itself or themselves, shall constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect:

(a) changes or effects that are primarily the result of general economic or
business conditions in the United States;

(b) changes or effects that are primarily the result of factors generally
affecting the industries or markets in which the Company operates; and

(c) in and of itself, a decrease in the Companys stock price or trading
volume; provided, however, that the exception in this clause shall not
prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect,

changes shall be used as evidence that some other change, effect,
circumstance or development has had or has not had a Company Material Adverse
Effect;

(d) delays in customer orders, reduction in sales, disruption in supplier,
distributor, partner or similar relationships, in each case, which are, or are
reasonably expected to be, temporary rather than permanent in nature and that

10 (e) changes or effects that are the result of or relate to compliance by the
Company with the terms of, or the taking of any action required or
contemplated by, this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent the
Company reasonably believes that compliance by the Company with the terms of,
or taking any action required or contemplated by, this Agreement, would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, only if
the Company provides prior written notification to Parent of such belief and
Parent does not provide relief from the provisions of this Agreement, shall
the changes or effects resulting from this subsection (e) be deemed not to
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect;

_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company successfully bears the burden of
proving that any such change in clause (a) or (b) immediately above does not
(i) primarily relate only to (or have the effect of primarily relating only
to) the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) disproportionately adversely
affect the Company and its Subsidiaries compared to other companies of similar
size operating in the industry in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate.

as of September 30, 2006, such internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of September 30, 2005, and the same are otherwise reasonably
designed to comply with the respective definitions of such controls in Rule

evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information,  



 

21  and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control
over financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent a summary
of any such disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors and audit
committee since October 1, 2003, and Section 5.6(e) of the Company Disclosure

of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,

or her capacity as an officer, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

directors (in their capacities as such) are in compliance with, and have
complied, in each case in all material respects, with (i) since the enactment
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
at the time that such provisions became effective, and (ii) since the date
that the Company Common Stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market,

to the NASDAQ Capital Market, and has not received notice from the NASDAQ
Capital Market, to the effect that the Company is or may be in violation of
any of the applicable NASDAQ Marketplace Rules). There are no outstanding

any Subsidiary of the Company. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act,
including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3), since the enactment of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or
modified (in any material way) personal loans or "extension of credit" to any

not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary
and usual course of such businesses and, since such date, there has not been
(a) any change in the financial condition, properties, business or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any development,
circumstance or occurrence or combination thereof which has had or would
reasonably be  



 

22  expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (including any adverse
change with respect to any development, circumstance or occurrence existing on
or prior to such date); (b) any material damage, destruction or other
casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned, leased or
otherwise used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not

indemnification obligations of the Company pursuant to any agreement, the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as amended, of the Company, or any
statute, are specified in Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) The only agreement or other obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries

5.9 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) All benefit and compensation plans, policies or arrangements, other than
commission arrangements, currently maintained or contributed to by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other entity, which together with the
Company or any of its  



 

23  Subsidiaries, is treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code
(an " _ _ERISA Affiliate__ ") (or in respect of which the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has any outstanding liability) and
covering current or former employees, independent contractors, consultants
(including, without limitation, outsourcing), temporary employees and current
or former directors of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate, which are "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _
_ERISA__ "), and any other written plan, policy or arrangement (whether or not
subject to ERISA) involving direct or indirect compensation, other than
commission arrangements, currently maintained by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate (or in respect of which the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has any outstanding liability)
and covering current or former employees, independent contractors, consultants
(including, without limitation, outsourcing), temporary employees and current
or former directors of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate, including insurance coverage, vacation, loans, fringe benefits,
severance benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses,
stock options, stock ownership or purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation,
stock based or other forms of incentive compensation, bonus or post-retirement
compensation or benefits (the " _ _Company Benefit Plans__ "), other than
Company Benefit Plans maintained outside of the United States primarily for
the benefit of employees working outside of the United States (such plans
hereinafter being referred to as " _ _Company Non U.S. Benefit Plans__"),
are listed on Section 5.9(a)-1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Complete
and accurate copies of all Company Benefit Plans listed on Section 5.9(a)-1 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, any amendments thereto, all summary plan
descriptions, any summary of material modifications thereto, all other
descriptions furnished to participants in a Company Benefit Plan, and any
benefits schedule, trust instruments, insurance contracts or other
funding vehicle forming a part of any such Company Benefit Plans, the Annual
Report (Form 5500 series) and schedules, if any, for the most recent prior
three years and opinions of independent accountants have been provided or made
available to Parent. Section 5.9(a)-2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies each employee or other service provider covered by any change in
control, employment or retention agreement of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and complete and accurate copies of the forms of each such
agreement, and any variations thereof, have been provided to Parent. Each
Company Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation arrangement has been
identified as either being exempt from or subject to Section 409A of the Code
(and identified as either an account balance plan, a non-account balance plan,
a severance plan or "other" plan) and for each deferred compensation
arrangement that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company has
provided a written description of how such arrangement has been operated in
accordance with Code Section 409A to the extent such operations are not part
of the written plan arrangement.

(b) All Company Benefit Plans, other than Company NonU.S. Benefit Plans (" _
_Company U.S. Benefit Plans__ "), are in substantial compliance with ERISA,
the Code and other applicable Laws. Each Company U.S. Benefit Plan which is
subject to ERISA (the " _ _Company ERISA Plans__ ") that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _
_Company Pension Plan__ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, has received a current favorable  



 

24  determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _ _IRS__ "),
and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in the
loss of the qualification of such Company Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code. The Company has not at any time maintained a voluntary employees
beneficiary association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any Company ERISA Plan that, assuming the Taxable period of
such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or
any Subsidiary to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to
incur a material Tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA or any material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.
With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of
the Code, the Company has adopted or will adopt amendments by December 31,
2006 (or such other extended deadline as may be permitted under Section 409A
of the Code), so that no such Company Benefit Plan is likely to result in any
participants incurring income acceleration or penalties under Section 409A of
the Code.

(c) No Company Benefit Plan is a "Multiemployer Plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a plan that has two or more contributing

of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _ _Multiemployer Plan__ "). None of the Company
Pension Plans is or ever has been (i) subject to Section 302 of ERISA, Section

whether pursuant to applicable Laws or the terms of such Company Benefit
Plan, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each Company
Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
SEC Reports prior to the date hereof.

(e) There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, litigation relating to the Company Benefit Plans. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and
life benefits under any Company ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement.
By its terms, the Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such
Company ERISA Plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder
other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or
termination, and no summary plan description or other written communication
distributed generally to participants or employees prohibits the Company or
its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plan.

(f) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense
incurred therefor for the most

applicable local Law, and have received all necessary rulings or
determinations as to the qualification (to the extent such concept or a
comparable concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction) of such Company
Non-U.S. Benefit Plans from the appropriate Governmental Entity. All
Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans, and all governmental plans, funds or programs
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contributes on behalf of any
of their employees, are listed on Section 5.9(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. All material contributions required to be made under each Company
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, whether pursuant to applicable Laws or the terms of

in the normal operation of such Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans) that has
resulted in, or is reasonably expected to result in, a material expense in
respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except pursuant to
retention or other agreements set forth in Section 5.9(a)-2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution of this Agreement, stockholder

its Subsidiaries who are employed outside of the United States to severance
pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after
the date hereof, (ii) except as specifically contemplated in Sections 4.3 and

within the scope of their employment, or (ii) independent contractors who have
assigned their rights to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
enforceable written agreements; or (b) acquired by the Company.

(j) All registered Trademarks and unregistered Trademarks currently used in
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been in continuous use
by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company. To the knowledge of the
Company, there has been no prior use of any such Trademarks or other action
taken by any Person that would confer upon said Person superior rights in such
Trademarks in connection with similar services or products, and the Company
has taken reasonable steps to prevent infringement of the Trademarks that
are Owned Intellectual Property, and the registered Trademarks that are Owned
Intellectual Property have been continuously used in the form appearing in,
and in connection with the goods and services listed in, their respective
registration certificates or identified in their respective pending

authorship or ownership of any part thereof.



 

34 (l) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to protect
the respective rights in confidential information and trade secrets used in

partner or corporate investor (in each case, who have received confidential
information from the Company) to execute proprietary information and
confidentiality agreements substantially consistent with the Companys
standard forms thereof (complete and current copies of which have been
delivered or made available). The Company has secured proprietary information
and confidentiality agreements and assignments substantially consistent with
the Companys Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement
from each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries that has contributed to
the development of the Owned Intellectual Property of the Company. Except
under valid and binding confidentiality obligations, there has been no

Board from furnishing (or causing to be furnished), prior to, but not after,
the time the vote is taken with respect to the approval of the Company Voting
Proposal at the Company Meeting, information concerning its business,
properties or assets, which information is not of greater scope, area or
detail than was provided to Parent, to any Person or group pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement with terms and conditions substantially similar
to those of the Confidentiality Agreement, and may negotiate and participate
in discussions and negotiations with such Person or group who has made a bona
fide, written Takeover Proposal, but only if: (w) such Takeover Proposal was
made after the date of this Agreement (it being understood that such a
Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement by a Person who has
made a Takeover Proposal prior to the date of this Agreement shall be
considered a new Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement) and
none of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their representatives has violated
any of the restrictions set forth in this  _Section 7.2_ (other than
immaterial violations that have not (1) directly or indirectly resulted in the
making of such Takeover Proposal or (2) otherwise had an adverse impact on
Parents rights under this  _Section 7.2_) with respect to such Person
making the Takeover Proposal; (x) such Person or group has submitted a
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board has determined (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) either (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) or (ii) is more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger and is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal; and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that such action is required to
discharge the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law. The Company shall not release or permit the release of
any Person from, or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company is a
party or under which the Company has any rights. The Company will promptly
(and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent telephonically
and in writing of the existence of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or
inquiry received by the Company that is or could reasonably be expected
to constitute a Takeover Proposal, and the Company will promptly communicate
in writing to Parent the terms and conditions of any such proposal,
discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it may receive and a copy thereof and
the identity of the Person making the same. The Company shall inform  



 

50  Parent within one (1) Business Day after any change to the material terms of
any such Takeover Proposal. Within one (1) Business Day after
any determination by the Company Board that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a
written notice advising them of such determination, specifying the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal, and providing Parent and Merger Sub with a copy of the
Superior Proposal. The Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company provided to any other Person or group
which was not previously provided to Parent.

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or
modify, or propose to the public or any Third Party (other than the Companys
agents and representatives) to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to

Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that such action is required to discharge the Company Boards
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law. 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or
recommend, or propose to the public or any Third Party (other than the
Companys agents and representatives) to approve or recommend, any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than
a confidentiality agreement expressly permitted by and in accordance with
Section 7.2(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to, but not after, the
time the vote is taken with respect to the adoption of this Agreement at the
Company Meeting, the Company Board may make a change in the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub (a " _ _Change in
Company Recommendation__ ") and/or approve or recommend a Superior Proposal,
and, in connection with such Superior Proposal, make any approvals, consents
or actions to exempt such Takeover Proposal from any Takeover Statute, and the
Company may enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal in connection with the termination of this Agreement, in
each case if (A) the Company shall have received a Superior Proposal which is
pending at the time the Company determines to take such action, (B) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that such action is required to discharge the Company
Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law
and (C) at least three (3) Business Days shall have passed following Parents
receipt of written notice from the Company (the " _ _Adverse Recommendation
Notice__ ") advising Parent that the Company Board has received such a
Superior Proposal which it intends to accept or recommend or advising Parent
that it intends to make a Change in Company Recommendation, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the other
information required by _Section 7.2(a) _(it being understood and agreed that
any material amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new
three (3) Business Day period), and Parent does not make an offer within such
three (3) Business Day period that the Company Board shall have concluded in
its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and
its outside counsel, is at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as
such Superior Proposal  



 

51  (it being agreed that the Company Board shall convene a meeting to consider
any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt thereof and that
the Company Board will not withhold, withdraw or modify its recommendation to
the Companys stockholders in favor of the Company Voting Proposal until the
earlier of the receipt of Parents revised offer or three (3) Business Days
after receipt by Parent of the Adverse Recommendation Notice).

ongoing entity), or to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company, and (A) otherwise on terms which the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors), and taking into
account all relevant terms and conditions of the proposal or offer that it
deems relevant (including, without limitation, all legal, financial,

the Merger, and (B) which, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the
Company Board, is reasonably capable of being consummated;

(iii) " _ _Competing Transaction__ " means any transaction, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to acquire beneficial

the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), in any such case pursuant
to any transaction or series of transactions, including without limitation

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the equity interest in either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(if the securities or ownership interests acquired in such Subsidiaries

including any filing related to a Competing Transaction), the Company shall
provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and comment (in light of
the requisite deadline for the filing) on each such filing in advance of its
filing with the SEC (and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to provide
comments, if any, as promptly as practicable), and the Company shall consider
and act in good faith with respect to the incorporation of any changes in such
filings reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the
resolution of any such comments. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government

any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any other filing with any
Governmental Entity, so that the Proxy Statement or such other filing shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties, and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff
or any other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of the

practicable a meeting of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_ _Company Meeting__ ") for the purpose of considering and voting upon the
Company Voting Proposal. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Article IX_, the obligation of the Company to convene and hold the
Company Meeting will not be limited or otherwise affected by a Change in

stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. Unless such
recommendation shall have been withdrawn or modified in accordance with
_Section 7.2_ (but without affecting in any manner the Companys obligations
pursuant to _Section 7.3_), the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company
Voting Proposal and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company required by
Delaware Law and, if applicable, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn the
Company Meeting, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting.

done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly
as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party
any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or

governmental request thereunder, and (C) any other applicable Law, and (iv)
execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this

other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) providing copies of written notices or
other communications received by such party or any of its respective

proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto) and (iv) if
requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations
of any applicable Law (including all information required to be included in
the Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company agree that
nothing contained in this _Section 7.6(a)_ shall modify or affect their
respective rights and responsibilities under _Section 7.6(b)_. In connection
with the foregoing, each party shall (i) promptly notify the other party in
writing of any communication received by that party or its Affiliates from any
Governmental Authority, and subject to applicable Laws, provide the other
party with a copy of any such written communication (or an oral or written
summary of any oral communication), and (ii) not participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless, where practicable, it
consults with the other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority and where practicable, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, each of Parent and the Company agree, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances or

prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively " _ _Antitrust Laws__ "),
to respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law,
and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary  



 

55  herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require, or be construed
to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to (i) proffer to, or agree
to, sell, license, lease, transfer or otherwise encumber (or consent to any
sale, license, lease, transfer or other encumbrance or agreement to sell,
license, lease, transfer or otherwise encumber by the Company), before or
after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets
or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates,
(ii) proffer to, or agree to, hold separate, before or after the Effective
Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (iii) agree to any
other changes (including, without limitation, through a licensing arrangement)
or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own or operate
the operations of any such assets or businesses or Parents ability to vote,
transfer, receive dividends with respect to or otherwise exercise ownership
rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation, or (iv) take
any other action under this Section 7.6 if the United States Department of
Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to
seek a preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation
of the Merger. The Company and Parent will each request early termination of
the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act.

(c) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at
the Effective Time or such earlier date as this Agreement may be terminated in
accordance with its terms, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (i) the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, (ii) any material failure of Parent and Merger Sub
or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or
agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, (iii) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened
in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Merger, or
(iv) any offers received by the Company and its Subsidiaries to settle or
compromise any litigation, claim, grievance, charge or proceeding involving
Intellectual Property or any other material litigation, claim, grievance,
charge or proceeding. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to
such partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

7.7 _Access_. Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of
information, upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required
by applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parent and its representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its
properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested, including information relating to Contracts with Governmental
Entities, insurance, pending litigation or claims, employee and employment
matters, and information regarding Company membership in standards
organizations, provided that no  



 

56  investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company, and  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company, would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) to
disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any information that is reasonably expected to jeopardize any attorney
client or other legal privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
(iii) to disclose any information where such disclosure would violate any
applicable Laws. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section
7.7_ shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or such Person
as may be designated by such executive officer. All information that is made
available pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

7.8 _Notice of Certain Matters_. Each party will notify the other party in
writing promptly after learning of: (i) any notice or other communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger; (ii) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger; (iii) any action, suit,
arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation by or before any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator initiated by or against it or any of its
Subsidiaries, or known by it or any of its Subsidiaries to be threatened
against it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or shareholders in their capacity as such, or of any oral
or written correspondence from any Person asserting or implying a claim
against it or with respect to any of its assets or properties (including
Intellectual Property) that is, or is reasonably likely to be, material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iv) any change,
occurrence or event which is reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions
to closing set forth in _Article VIII_ not to be satisfied; (v) any claim, or
any written inquiry by any Taxing authority, regarding a material deficiency
to pay Taxes payable by the Company; or (vi) any event that occurs after the
date of this Agreement, that had it occurred prior to the date of this
Agreement, would have constituted a material exception to the representation
set forth in _Section 5.6(e)_. Each party shall give prompt notice to the
other party of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties herein or
affect the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder.

7.9 _De-listing_. If immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to give timely notice of de-listing to, and
cause the shares of Company Common Stock to cease trading on, the
NASDAQ Capital Market effective as of the Effective Time and, if applicable,
to report timely such event on Form 8-K.

7.10 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult
with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to
review, comment upon and concur with and use  



 

57  reasonable efforts to agree on, any press releases or otherwise making
public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect thereto,
except as may be required by Law or by obligations (if applicable) pursuant to
the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 7.10_, either party may respond to questions from
stockholders or inquiries from financial analysts and media representatives in
a manner that is consistent with then-existing public disclosures.

7.11 _Company and Parent Benefit Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, if
requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans effective not earlier than the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in
writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the
applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended the
employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the
extent necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall commence to participate therein following the Effective
Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes
such participation. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, Parent shall cause to be amended, or take any actions Parent
deems appropriate, the employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its
Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide that no employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall commence to participate therein following
the Effective Time unless Parent or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such
participation.

7.12 _Loans to Company Employees, Officers and Directors_. Prior to the
Effective Time, all loans (other than travel advances, payroll advances
and other advances made in the ordinary course of business, which in each
case do not exceed $1,000) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any of
their employees, officers or directors shall be no longer outstanding.

7.13 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain, in all material respects and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law the same provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement and director and officer exculpation set forth in the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Company on the date of this Agreement,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of persons who at any time prior to the
Effective Time were entitled to indemnification, advancement or exculpation
under the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company in respect
of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), unless such modification is required by Law. From the Effective
Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective
Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and
hold harmless each person who was, is now, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), against all claims, losses,
 



 

58  liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _
_Costs__ "), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware
Law for officers and directors of Delaware corporations. Each Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ , _that_ , any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense
to the Indemnified Parties, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective
Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of
150% of the annual premium paid by the Company in its most recent fiscal
year, which premium is set forth in Section 7.13(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (150% of such annual premium, the " _ _Maximum Premium__ "). If the
Companys existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such
six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as
much directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions as favorable as can be obtained in
comparison to the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance. The provisions of this _Section 7.13(b)_ shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if Parent, with the cooperation of the Company, obtains prepaid
policies prior to the Closing for purposes of this _Section 7.13_, which
policies provide such Indemnified Parties with coverage no less advantageous
to the insured for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time
(including those related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby).

(c) If Parent fails to comply with its obligations under this  _Section
7.13_, and, in order to enforce an Indemnified Partys rights under this
_Section 7.13_, an Indemnified Party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against Parent that Parent breached its obligations under this
_Section 7.13_, Parent shall pay to the Indemnified Party its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with such suit after delivery to Parent of
reasonable documentation evidencing such costs and expenses.



 

59 (d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns)
consolidates or merges with any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving Person in such consolidation or merger, then in each case proper
provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving Person (or its
successors or assigns, if applicable) shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 7.13.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.13_ are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives in accordance with _Section 10.8_
hereof.

7.14 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such lawful
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or by the
Merger and otherwise take such lawful actions to eliminate the effects of
such statute or regulation on such transactions.

7.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from
the transactions contemplated by _Article I_ of this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall have been made or obtained (as the case may be) except those that the

Affiliates would be subject to risk of criminal sanctions or any of their
representatives would be subject to the risk of criminal or civil sanctions.

(e) _Required Consents_.

(i) The consents, approvals or waivers indicated on _Schedule 8.2(e)(i)_ shall

Merger pursuant to this _Article IX_, this Agreement (other than as set forth
in _Section 10.1_) shall become void and of no effect with no liability or
obligation on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , except as otherwise provided
herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability
or damages resulting from any fraud or willful or intentional breach of this
Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of
the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive in accordance with their terms.

(b) The Company agrees to pay Parent a fee, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, of $7,300,000 (the " _ _Termination Fee__ ") and
shall pay all of the Expenses (as defined in Section 10.14) of Parent actually
incurred from third-parties relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement prior to termination (in each case payable by wire transfer of
same day funds on the date that the Termination Fee or the Expenses, as
applicable, is due as provided below), in the event this Agreement is
terminated:

(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or (b), if the
following shall have occurred:

(A) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Meeting, a
Takeover Proposal (substituting 35% for the 15% threshold set forth in
the definition of Competing Transaction for purposes of this _Section
9.5(b)(i)(A)_) was made to the Company or publicly disclosed, prior to either
(1) with respect to any termination pursuant to Section 9.2(a), the date of
such termination or (2) with respect to any termination pursuant to Section
9.2(b), the date of the Company Meeting; and



 

66 (B) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement to
consummate, or shall have consummated or shall have approved or recommended to
the Companys stockholders or otherwise not opposed, a Competing Transaction
(substituting 35% for the 15% threshold set forth in the definition of
Competing Transaction for purposes of this _Section 9.5(b)(i)(B)_);

(ii) by the Company (A) pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ and, prior to the date
of the Company Meeting, any event giving rise to Parents right of termination
under _Section 9.4(a)_ shall have occurred or (B) pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)_; or

(iii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_.

The Termination Fee shall be paid by the Company no later than: (x) two (2)
Business Days after the first to occur of the execution of an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement),
approval or recommendation to the Companys stockholders of a Takeover
Proposal, failure to oppose a Takeover Proposal or the consummation of a
Competing Transaction, in the case of clause (i) above; (y) on the date of
termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (ii) above; and (z) two
(2) Business Days after termination of this Agreement in the case of clause
(iii) above. The Expenses shall be paid to Parent within two (2) Business
Days after demand therefor and delivery to the Company of reasonable
documentation therefor following the occurrence of the termination event
giving rise to the Termination Fee payment obligation described in this
_Section 9.5(b)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub agree that payment of such Termination Fee, if such
payment is actually paid and is accepted by Parent, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub upon the termination of this
Agreement, and that all other damages or remedies, at law or in equity
(including provisional remedies), that might otherwise have been available to
Parent and Merger Sub are waived by Parent and Merger Sub upon the acceptance
of such payment; provided, however, that prior to payment of such Termination
Fee to Parent and acceptance by Parent thereof, nothing herein shall prohibit
Parent from seeking specific performance of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
however, Parent shall not unreasonably reject the payment of any Termination
Fee paid in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with the termination provisions set forth in this Article IX. Under no
circumstances shall the Termination Fee be payable more than once pursuant to
this Article IX. The Company  



 

67  acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.5(b)_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement. If the Company fails to pay both the Termination Fee and Expenses
in accordance with this _Section 9.5(b)_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, the
Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee and/or
Expenses, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime rate as announced in the _The Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made, after delivery to the
Company of reasonable documentation evidencing such costs and expenses.

VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY (this " _ _Agreement__ ") is made
and entered into as of November 13, 2006, by and among Motorola, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _ _Parent__ "),and each of the stockholders whose
names appear on the signature pages of this Agreement (each, a " _
_Stockholder__ " and, collectively, the " _ _Stockholders__ ").

RECITALS

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, GTG Subsidiary
IV Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _
_Merger Sub__ "), and Netopia, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _
_Company__ ") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _
_Merger Agreement__ "), which provides for the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of
Merger Sub with and into the Company.

B. Pursuant to the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company will be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

C. As of the date hereof, each Stockholder Beneficially Owns (as defined
below) the number of Shares (as defined below) of capital stock of the
Company as set forth on the signature page of this Agreement.

D. In order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to execute the Merger Agreement,
the Stockholders desire to restrict the transfer or disposition of, and desire
to vote, the Shares as provided in this Agreement, and the execution and
delivery of this Agreement is a material condition to Parents willingness to
enter into the Merger Agreement.

E. As stockholders of the Company, the Stockholders will benefit from the
execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Certain Definitions._ Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement:

Person has "beneficial ownership" of such securities as determined pursuant to
Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(b) _" _Constructive Sale_ "_ means, with respect to any security, a short
sale or entering into or acquiring an offsetting derivative contract with
respect to such security, entering into or acquiring a futures or forward
contract to deliver such security or entering into any other hedging or other
derivative transaction that has the effect of materially changing the
economic benefits and risks of ownership of such security.

(c) _" _Expiration Date_ "_ means the earlier to occur of (i) such date and
time as the Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Merger Agreement and (ii) such date and time as the Merger
Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to Article IX thereof. (d) _" _Options_ "_ means, with respect to each Stockholder: (i) all

including, without limitation, in each case, shares issued upon the
conversion, exercise or exchange of Options, but excluding in each case
any shares of capital stock deemed to be Beneficially Owned by such
stockholder solely by virtue of such stockholder having a right to acquire
such shares within 60 days upon exercise of Options Beneficially Owned by such
Stockholder.

(g) _" _Transfer_ "_ means, with respect to any security, the direct or
indirect assignment, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, hypothecation, gift,
placement in trust, Constructive Sale or other disposition of such security

beneficial ownership of such security, and each agreement, arrangement or
understanding, whether or not in writing, to effect any of the foregoing, but
excluding any Transfer pursuant to a court order or any Transfer to an
affiliate or trust, in each case that is under the control of a Stockholder.

2\. _No Transfer of Shares or Options._ Each Stockholder agrees that, at all
times during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on

of 1934, as amended, to which such Stockholder is a party that relates to the

5\. _Irrevocable Proxy._ Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably (to the fullest

proxies of such Stockholder with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Expiration
Date to vote and exercise all voting and related rights with respect to, and
to grant a consent or approval in respect of (in each case, to the full extent
that such Stockholder is entitled to do so), all of the Shares (including,
without limitation, the power to execute and deliver written consents), at
every annual, special, adjourned or postponed meeting of stockholders of the
Company and in every written consent in lieu of such meeting in accordance
with Section 4 hereof. THIS PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY IS IRREVOCABLE AND

Shares on the matters referred to in Section 4 and agrees not to grant any
subsequent proxies or powers of attorney with respect to the voting of the
Shares on the matters referred to in Section 4 until after the Expiration
Date. Each Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering

delivery of this Agreement and the Stockholders granting of the proxies
contained in this Section 5\. Each Stockholder hereby affirms that the proxy
granted in this Section 5 is given in connection with the execution of the
Merger Agreement, and that such proxy is given to secure the performance of
the duties of such Stockholder under this Agreement. Each Stockholder agrees
to execute any further agreement or form reasonably necessary to confirm and
effectuate the grant of the proxy contained herein.

of the Shares for and on behalf of all beneficial owners of the Shares.

any rights of first refusal, co-sale rights, security interests, liens,

encumbrances of any kind or nature (" _ _Encumbrances__ ").

(e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder do not,
and such Stockholders performance of its obligations under this Agreement

agreement applicable to such Stockholder or by which such Stockholder or any
of such Stockholders properties or assets, including, without limitation, the
Shares and Options, is bound.

(f) Such Stockholder has full power and authority to make, enter into and
carry out the terms of this Agreement with respect to all of the Shares
without limitation, qualification or restriction on such power and authority.

(g) The failure of the spouse, if any, of such Stockholder to be a party or
signatory to this Agreement shall not (i) prevent such Stockholder from
performing such Stockholders obligations and consummating the transactions
contemplated hereunder or (ii) prevent this Agreement from constituting the
legal, valid and binding obligation of such Stockholder in accordance with its
terms.

7\. _Consents and Waivers._ Each Stockholder hereby gives all consents and
waivers that may be required from it for the execution delivery of this
Agreement and for the consummation of the Merger under the terms of any
agreement or instrument to which such Stockholder is a party or subject or in
respect of any rights such Stockholder may have. Each Stockholder further

terms of this Agreement, each Stockholder further consents and authorizes
Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in the Proxy
Statement (including all documents filed with the SEC in connection
therewith) such Stockholders identity and ownership of the Shares and the
nature of such Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings
under this Agreement. 

8\. _Termination._ This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further
force or effect as of the Expiration Date.

9\. _Legending of Shares._ Each Stockholder agrees that, if so requested by
Parent, certificates evidencing the Shares of such Stockholder shall bear the

employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries or take any other action, in each
such case regarding or to facilitate the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 10 shall prevent a
Stockholder, in his capacity as a director or executive officer of the
Company from engaging in any activity permitted pursuant to Section 7.2 of the
Merger Agreement.

the remainder of this Agreement shall not be impaired or otherwise affected

permitted by law.

(g) _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that

jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware

any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in connection with
any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters

authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives
and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise
have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process.

represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

(i) _Remedies._ The parties acknowledge that Parent will be irreparably harmed
and that there will be no adequate remedy at law in the event of a violation
or breach of any of the terms of this Agreement. Therefore, it is agreed that,
in addition to any other remedies that may be available to Parent upon any
such violation or breach, Parent shall have the right to enforce the terms
hereof by specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means
available to Parent at law or in equity, and that each Stockholder waives the
posting of any bond or security in connection with any proceedings related
thereto. All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or
otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative
and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any
thereof by Parent shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of
any other such right, power or remedy by Parent.

(j) _Binding Effect; No Assignment._ This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns, but, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by any
of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Section 13(j) shall be void.
