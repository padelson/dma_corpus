ARTICLE II

   

CONVERSION OF NORCROWN SHARES

   

 2.1.   _Conversion of NorCrown Stock_. Except for shares of NorCrown Common Stock  held by any shareholder validly exercising dissenters rights  ("Dissenting Shares"), the shares of NorCrown Common Stock  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue  of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be  converted at the Effective Time as follows: 

   

 (a)   _Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.1, including  the election provisions provided for hereunder, each share of NorCrown Common  Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding  any shares of NorCrown Common Stock held in treasury pursuant to Section 2.4 and  any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right  to receive (x) that number of shares of common stock, no par value, of Valley  ("Valley Common Stock") equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined  below) and (y) cash in an amount equal to $13.4292 (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"). For purposes of determining the  Exchange Ratio, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

--- 
      

* * *

          

   (i)   "Closing Price" shall mean the closing sale price of Valley  Common Stock on a Trading Day as supplied by the New York Stock Exchange (as  reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, another  mutually agreed to authoritative source). 

   

   (ii)   "Trading Day" shall mean a day for which a Closing Price is so  supplied. 

   

   (iii)   "Average Closing Price" shall mean the average of the Closing  Prices on the twenty Trading Days immediately preceding the date which is 5  business days prior to the Closing Date. 

   

   (iv)   "Exchange Ratio" shall mean $13.4292 divided by the Average  Closing Price, rounded to four decimal places. 

   

 An appropriate legend will be placed on all certificates representing Valley Common Stock issued in the Merger evidencing that the shares are being issued in a private placement. Valley agrees to remove such legends upon written request, accompanied by a letter, from a law firm and in form and substance acceptable to Valley, opining that such legends are no longer required by applicable securities laws. 

   

   The shareholders of NorCrown (each a "Shareholder" and collectively the "Shareholders") shall each have the right to elect to receive, in exchange for each share of NorCrown Common Stock held by such Shareholder, either (i) (A) that number of shares of Valley Common Stock as is equal to the Exchange Ratio, plus (B) the Per Share Cash Consideration (collectively, the "Per Share Cash/Stock Consideration"), or (ii) $26.8584 in cash (the "Per Share All Cash Consideration"), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Shareholder seeking to receive shares of Valley Common Stock in exchange for their NorCrown Common Stock shall be required to execute an Investor Certificate in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , or, in the case of the Trust, an Investor Certificate in the Form of _Exhibit B_. Any Shareholder electing to receive Valley Common Stock who fails to deliver a Investor Certificate or any Shareholder failing to make an election shall, notwithstanding such election or failure to elect, receive the Per Share All Cash Consideration in exchange for their NorCrown Common Stock. Any election shall be applicable to all shares of NorCrown Common Stock held by the Shareholder making the election. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Trust has irrevocably agreed to elect to receive the Per Share Cash/Stock Consideration. 

   

 (b)   _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Valley Common Stock shall be  issued pursuant to the Merger, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be  made equal to the Average Closing Price multiplied by the fraction of a share  which would otherwise have been issued. 

   

 (c)   _Cancellation of NorCrown Certificates_. After the Effective Time, each  share of NorCrown Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be converted into the right to receive, and each of the  certificates (the "Certificates") previously evidencing any  shares of NorCrown Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time (other than any shares of NorCrown Common Stock held in treasury pursuant  to Section 2.4) shall thereafter represent the right to receive the  consideration described in Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) hereof. After the  Effective Time, the Shareholders shall cease to have any rights with respect to  their shares of NorCrown Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by  law. The Certificates shall be exchanged for certificates evidencing shares of  Valley Common Stock and/or cash issued pursuant to this Article II, upon the  surrender of such Certificates in accordance with this Article II.

       (d) _Election and Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (1)   The election required by Section 2.1(a) and the exchange required by Section  2.2(c) shall be made by the Shareholders by mailing to the Exchange Agent a Form  of Election. A Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and submitted  to the Exchange Agent by the Shareholder and accompanied by all the certificates  representing the shares of NorCrown Common Stock as to which the election is  being made. Valley will have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or  in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been  properly completed, signed and submitted and to disregard immaterial defects in  Forms of Election. The good faith decision of Valley (or the Exchange Agent) in  such matters shall be conclusive and binding, provided that Valley (and the  Exchange Agent) does not act unreasonably. Neither Valley nor the Exchange Agent  will be under any obligation to, but Valley and the Exchange Agent may (if they  choose to do so), notify any person of any defect in a Form of Election  submitted to the Exchange Agent. Valley and NorCrown shall each use its best  efforts to mail the Form of Election to all persons who are holders of record of  NorCrown Common Stock on the record date for the Shareholders Meeting (as  hereinafter defined) at least the date fifteen calendar days prior to the  anticipated Effective Time. A Form of Election must be received by the Exchange  Agent by the close of business on the third business day prior to the Closing in  order to be effective. All elections will be irrevocable. 

   

 (2)   Upon surrender of certificates of NorCrown Common Stock for exchange and  cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,  duly executed, the Record Holder shall be entitled to promptly receive in  exchange for such Certificates the consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)  hereof and the certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. The Exchange Agent  shall not be obligated to deliver or cause to be delivered to any Shareholder  the consideration to which such Shareholder would otherwise be entitled until  such Shareholder surrenders the certificates for exchange or, in default  thereof, an appropriate Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement and/or a bond  as may be reasonably required in each case by Valley. Notwithstanding the time  of surrender of the certificates, Shareholders shall be deemed shareholders of  Valley (if election to receive the Per Share Cash/Stock Consideration is made)  for all purposes from the Effective Time, except that Valley shall withhold the  payment of dividends from any Shareholder until such Shareholder effects the  exchange of certificates for Valley Common Stock. (Such Shareholder shall  receive such withheld dividends, without interest, upon effecting the share  exchange.) 

   

 (e)   _Closing Statement; Estimate_. 

   

 (1)   Within 30 days after Closing, Valley shall deliver to the Trust a statement (the  "Closing Statement") setting forth the balance sheet of  NorCrown and Shareholders Equity as of the Closing Date and a written  report setting forth the calculations of the Closing Statement,  Shareholders Equity and Adjusted Shareholders Equity.  "Shareholders Equity" means the shareholders equity  of NorCrown as of the Closing Date prepared in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a basis  consistent with the preparation of the NorCrown Financial Statements (as such  term is defined in Section 3.4). Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Shareholders Equity as of the Closing Date shall be determined after  accruing the following fees and expenses whether or not then payable: (i) all  legal fees and expenses of NorCrown incurred in connection with any regulatory  investigation, enforcement action, or agreement related to NorCrown or the  Trust, (ii) all of the expenses (including professional fees and expenses)  incurred by NorCrown in connection with the Merger, and (iii) all Taxes (as such  term is defined in Section 3.8).

* * *

           

   Adjustments  will then be made to Shareholders Equity to determine the Adjusted Shareholders Equity. "Adjusted Shareholders Equity" means the Shareholders Equity adjusted on an after-tax basis as follows: (i) any severance payments paid or accrued as of the Closing Date will be added back, (ii) any stay bonuses paid or accrued by NorCrown as of the Closing Date will be added back (subject to a maximum of $495,000), (iii) any Change in Control contract payments paid to employees or accrued by NorCrown as of the Closing Date will be added back (subject to a maximum of $778,906), (iv) termination fees for FSI data contracts paid or accrued as of the Closing Date will be added back (maximum of $1,840,000), (v) professional fees and expenses of the Merger paid or accrued as of the Closing Date will be added back (maximum of $125,000), (vi) any of the adjustments required by SFAS No. 115 will disregarded; (vii) any gains or losses from the sale of investment securities sold during the period from 30 days prior to the date hereof to the Closing Date will be disregarded; and (viii) any pending claims for indemnity under the NorCrown Governing Documents (as such term is defined in Section 3.1(a) hereof) will be subtracted. 

   

   If the Trust objects to the information set forth therein, the Trust shall, within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice (the "Disputed Items Notice") to Valley specifying in detail the basis for such objection and setting forth the Trusts computation of the items in dispute (each, a "Disputed Item"). The Trust shall have prompt and reasonable access to all books and records of NorCrown to the extent relating to the Trusts review of the Closing Statement. Valley and the Trust shall promptly attempt to resolve the Disputed Items and agree upon a final Closing Statement. 

   

 (2)   If the Trust and Valley shall be unable to resolve the Disputed Items in the  Disputed Items Notice within 15 days after delivery thereof, a nationally  recognized certified public accounting firm selected by mutual agreement of  Valley and the Trust (the "Arbiter") shall resolve the Disputed  Items and determine the Shareholders Equity and Adjusted  Shareholders Equity as of the Closing by reference to the Closing  Statement (the "Final Determination"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , the Arbiter shall only determine those items set forth in the  Disputed Items Notice and shall have prompt and reasonable access to all books  and records of NorCrown to the extent that they relate to the Arbiters  review of the Disputed Items. The Final Determination shall be rendered by the  Arbiter to Valley and the Trust within 60 days after expiration of the 15-day  time frame set forth in clause (2) of this Section 2.1(e). The Final  Determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and may not be  disputed by Valley or the Trust in any forum or by any means and shall  hereinafter be referred to as the "Final Closing Statement."

* * *

           

 (3)   If the Trust shall not have delivered a Disputed Items Notice to Valley within  30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement or prior thereto, the Trust  shall be deemed to have accepted by written notice to Valley the Closing  Statement; such Closing Statement shall be conclusively presumed to be true and  correct in all respects and shall be binding upon the parties hereto and may not  be disputed by any party in any forum or by any means, and shall hereinafter be  referred to as the "Final Closing Statement." 

   

 (4)   To the extent that the Adjusted Shareholders Equity agreed to (or deemed  agreed to) by the parties in the Final Closing Statement is less than  $47,000,000 (the "Target Shareholders Equity"), the  amount of such deficiency shall be defined as the "Closing Statement  Deficit." In the event there is a Closing Statement Deficit, the Trust  shall pay to Valley, within 3 business days following the final determination of  the Adjusted Shareholders Equity, the amount of such Closing Statement Deficit  by directing the Indemnification Escrow Agent (as such term in defined in  Section 8.4) to release such portion of the Indemnification Escrow Shares (as  such term in defined in Section 8.4) as is equal to the Closing Statement  Deficit to Valley in accordance with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow  Agreement (as such term in defined in Section 8.4). 

   

 2.2.   _Exchange of Shares_. 

   

 (a)   The parties shall exchange all the Certificates (other than those representing  NorCrown Common Stock held by dissenting Shareholders, if any) for all of the  consideration provided for in Section 2.1 at the Closing. Upon surrender of a  Certificate for exchange and cancellation at Closing (or if applicable with  respect to any shares of NorCrown Common Stock held by dissenting Shareholders,  after Closing), the record holder of the shares represented by the Certificate  shall receive in exchange for the Certificate the consideration as provided in  Section 2.1 hereof and the Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. No  Shareholder will receive the consideration to which that Shareholder would  otherwise be entitled until the Shareholder surrenders the Certificate for  exchange or, in lieu thereof, an appropriate Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity  Agreement and/or a bond as may be reasonably required in each case by Valley.  Notwithstanding the time of surrender of the Certificates, the Shareholders  shall be deemed shareholders of Valley for all purposes from the Effective Time,  except that Valley shall withhold the payment of dividends from any Shareholder  until that Shareholder effects the exchange of his Certificates for Valley  Common Stock. The Shareholder shall receive such withheld dividends, without  interest, upon effecting the share exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all  payments for shares of NorCrown Common Stock held by dissenting Shareholders, if  any, shall be made in accordance with applicable statutory law or regulations. 

   

 (b)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer  books of NorCrown of the shares of NorCrown Common Stock which were outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time and, if any Certificates representing  such shares are presented for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged  for the consideration as provided in Section 2.1 hereof. 

   

 (c)   If payment of the consideration as provided in Section 2.1 hereof is to be made  in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange  therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the  Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an  appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,  and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to either, at the election  of Valley, (i) VNBs trust department or (ii) American Stock Transfer and  Trust Company (in either case, the "Exchange Agent") in advance  any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other  than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required  for any other reason, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the  Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 2.3 _VNB Common Stock_. The shares of common stock of VNB outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger but shall be the same number of shares of the Surviving Bank. 

   

 2.4 _Certain NorCrown Shares Retired_. Each share of NorCrown Preferred Stock and each share of NorCrown Common Stock that is held in the treasury of NorCrown shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time and no capital stock of Valley, cash or other consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor.

 3.1.   _Organization_. 

   

   (a)   NorCrown is a commercial bank organized under the laws of the State of New  Jersey the deposits of which are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund  ("BIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the  "FDIC") to the fullest extent permitted by law. NorCrown is  duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the  State of New Jersey.

The _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth true and  complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (such documents  or similar governing documents for an entity are referred to herein as the  entitys "Governing Documents") of NorCrown as in effect  on the date hereof.

Except as set forth in the  _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , NorCrown does not own or control, directly  or indirectly, any equity interest in any corporation, company, association,  partnership, joint venture or other entity and owns no real estate, except real  estate used for its banking premises and except for real estate in foreclosure  with a fair market value of less than $500,000.

   (c)   For purposes of this agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" means  any change, circumstance or effect that has a material adverse effect on the  business, operations, assets or financial condition of such entity and its  Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 3.8.   _Taxes and Tax Returns_. 

   

   (a)   NorCrown and each Subsidiary have timely filed (and until the Effective Time  will so file) all Returns required to be filed by them in respect of any Taxes  (which such Returns which have already been filed were and continue to be, true,  correct and complete in all material respects and which such Returns which will  be filed will be true, correct and complete in all material respects when filed)  and, except as set forth on _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , each has duly  paid (and until the Effective Time will so pay) all such Taxes shown as due on  such Returns, other than Taxes or other charges which are being contested in  good faith (and disclosed to Valley in writing). NorCrown and each Subsidiary  have established (and until the Effective Time will establish) on their books  and records reserves for the payment of all Taxes not yet due and payable, but  incurred in respect of NorCrown or any Subsidiary through such date, which  reserves are adequate for such purposes. Except as set forth in _NorCrown  Disclosure Schedule_ , the federal income tax Returns of NorCrown and each  Subsidiary have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the  "IRS") (or are closed to examination due to the expiration of  the applicable statute of limitations) and no deficiencies were asserted as a  result of such examinations which have not been resolved and paid in full.  Except as set forth in _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , the applicable state  income and local tax returns of NorCrown and each Subsidiary have been examined  by the applicable authorities (or are closed to examination due to the  expiration of the statute of limitations) and no deficiencies were asserted as a  result of such examinations which have not been resolved and paid in full. To  NorCrowns knowledge, there are no audits or other administrative or court  proceedings presently pending nor any other disputes pending, or claims asserted  for, Taxes or assessments upon NorCrown or any of Subsidiaries, nor has NorCrown  or any of Subsidiaries given any currently outstanding waivers or comparable  consents regarding the application of the statute of limitations with respect to  any Taxes or Returns. 

   

   (b)   Except as set forth in _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , neither NorCrown nor  any of the Subsidiaries: (i) has requested any extension of time within which to  file any tax Return which Return has not since been filed; (ii) is a party to  any agreement providing for the allocation or sharing of taxes; (iii) is  required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), by  reason of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by NorCrown or any  Subsidiary (nor does NorCrown have any knowledge that the IRS has proposed any  such adjustment or change of accounting method); (iv) has taken or agreed to  take any action, has failed to take any action, or knows of any fact, agreement,  plan or other circumstances that could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a  "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; (v)  has been included in any "consolidated," "unitary" or  "combined" Return (other than the Returns which include only NorCrown  and any of Subsidiaries) provided for under the laws of the United States, any  foreign jurisdiction or any state or locality; (vi) has participated in or  otherwise engaged in any transaction described in Treasury Regulations Section  301.6111-2(b)(2) or any "Reportable Transaction" within the meaning of  Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b); (vii) is a party to any agreement or  arrangement that would result, separately or in the aggregate, in the actual or  deemed payment by NorCrown of any of its Subsidiaries of any "excess  parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code; and/or  (viii) has received any claim by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where  it does not file Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that  jurisdiction. 

   

12

         (c)   Except as set forth in _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , (i) NorCrown and  each of the Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with all  applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and withholding  of Taxes and has, within the time and in the manner provided bylaw, withheld and  paid over to the proper Governmental Entities all material amounts required to  be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws; and (ii) NorCrown and each  of its Subsidiaries has maintained such records in respect to each transaction,  event and item (including as required to support otherwise allowable deductions  and losses) as are required under applicable Tax law. 

   

   (d)   NorCrown has made available to Valley correct and complete copies of: (i) all  material Returns filed within the past three years by NorCrown and each of its  Subsidiaries; (ii) all audit reports, letter rulings, technical advice memoranda  and similar documents issued by a Governmental Entity within the past three  years relating to Taxes due from or with respect to NorCrown or any of its  Subsidiaries; and (iii) any closing letters or agreements entered into by  NorCrown or any of its Subsidiaries with any Governmental Entities within the  past five years with respect to Taxes. 

   

   (e)   For purposes of this Agreement, the terms: (i) "Tax" or  "Taxes" means: (A) any and all taxes, customs, duties, tariffs,  imposts, charges, deficiencies, assessments, levies or other like governmental  charges, including, without limitation, income, gross receipts, excise, real or  personal property, ad valorem, value added, estimated, alternative minimum,  stamp, sales, withholding, social security, occupation, use, service, service  use, license, net worth, payroll, franchise, transfer and other recording taxes  and charges, imposed by the IRS or any other taxing authority (whether domestic  or foreign, including, without limitation, any state, county, local or foreign  government or any subdivision or taxing agency thereof (including a United  States possession)), whether computed on a separate, consolidated, unitary,  combined or any other basis and such term shall include any interest, fines  penalties or additional amounts attributable to, or imposed upon, or with  respect to, any such amounts, (B) any liability for the payment of any amounts  described in (A) as a result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated,  combined, unitary, or similar group or as a result of transferor or successor  liability, and (C) any liability for the payment of any amounts as a result of  being a party to any tax sharing agreement or as a result of any obligation to  indemnify any other person with respect to the payment of any amounts of the  type described in (A) or (B); (ii) "Return" means any return,  declaration, report, claim for refund, or information return or statement  relating to Taxes, including any schedule or attachment thereto, and including  any amendment thereof, which is required to be filed with a Governmental Entity;  and (iii) "Governmental Entity" means any (A) Federal,  state, local, municipal or foreign government, (B) governmental,  quasi-governmental authority (including any governmental agency, commission,  branch, department or official, and any court or other tribunal) or body  exercising, or entitled to exercise, any governmentally-derived administrative,  executive, judicial, legislative, police, regulatory or taxing authority, or (C)  any self-regulatory organization, administrative or regulatory agency,  commission or authority.

       3.9.   _Employee Benefit Plans_. 

   

   (a)   Except as disclosed in the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule,_ neither NorCrown  nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to any "employee  pension benefit plan", within the meaning of Section 3(2)(A) of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended  ("ERISA") (the "NorCrown Pension Plans"),  "employee welfare benefit plan", within the meaning of Section 3(1) of  ERISA (the "NorCrown Welfare Plans"), stock option plan, stock  purchase plan, deferred compensation plan, severance plan, bonus plan,  employment agreement or other similar plan, program or arrangement. Neither  NorCrown nor any of its Subsidiaries has, since September 2, 1974, contributed  to any "Multiemployer Plan", within the meaning of Sections 3(37) and  4001(a)(3) of ERISA. 

   

   (b)   NorCrown has delivered to Valley in the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ a  complete and accurate copy of each of the following with respect to each of the  NorCrown Pension Plans and NorCrown Welfare Plans: (i) plan document, summary  plan description, and summary of material modifications (if not available, a  detailed description of the foregoing); (ii) trust agreement or insurance  contract, if any; (iii) most recent IRS determination letter, if any; (iv) most  recent actuarial report, if any; and (v) most recent annual report on Form 5500,  if any. 

   

   (c)   The present value of all accrued benefits both vested and non-vested under each  of the NorCrown Pension Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, based upon the  actuarial assumptions used for purposes of the most recent actuarial valuation  prepared by such NorCrown Pension Plans actuary, did not exceed the then  current value of the assets of such plans allocable to such accrued benefits. To  NorCrowns knowledge, the actuarial assumptions then utilized for such  plans were reasonable and appropriate as of the last valuation date and reflect  then current market conditions. 

   

   (d)   During the last six years, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the  "PBGC") has not asserted any claim for liability against  NorCrown or any of its Subsidiaries which has not been paid in full. 

   

   (e)   All premiums (and interest charges and penalties for late payment, if  applicable) due to the PBGC with respect to each NorCrown Pension Plan have been  paid. All contributions required to be made to each NorCrown Pension Plan under  the terms thereof, ERISA or other applicable law have been timely made, and all  amounts properly accrued to date as liabilities of NorCrown and its Subsidiaries  which have not been paid have been properly recorded on the books of NorCrown  and its Subsidiaries. 

   

   (f)   Except as disclosed on the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , each of the  NorCrown Pension Plans, the NorCrown Welfare Plans and each other plan and  arrangement identified on the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ has been  operated in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of ERISA,  the Code, all regulations, rulings and announcements promulgated or issued  thereunder, and all other applicable governmental laws and regulations.  Furthermore, the IRS has issued a favorable determination letter, which takes  into account the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and (to the extent it mandates currently  applicable requirements) subsequent legislation, with respect to each of the  NorCrown Pension Plans and NorCrown is not aware of any fact or circumstance  which would disqualify any such plan, that could not be retroactively corrected  (in accordance with the procedures of the IRS). 

   

14

         (g)   To NorCrowns knowledge, no non-exempt prohibited transaction, within the  meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred with  respect to any of the NorCrown Welfare Plans or NorCrown Pension Plans. 

   

   (h)   No NorCrown Pension Plan or any trust created thereunder has been terminated,  nor have there been any "reportable events", within the meaning of  Section 4043(b) of ERISA, with respect to any of the NorCrown Pension Plans. 

   

   (i)   No "accumulated funding deficiency", within the meaning of  Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with respect to any of the  NorCrown Pension Plans. 

   

   (j)   There are no pending, or, to NorCrowns knowledge, threatened or  anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or  against any of the NorCrown Pension Plans or the NorCrown Welfare Plans, any  trusts related thereto or any other plan or arrangement identified in the  _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_. 

   

   (k)   Except as disclosed in the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , no NorCrown  Pension or Welfare Plan provides medical or death benefits (whether or not  insured) beyond an employees retirement or other termination of service,  other than (i) coverage mandated by law, or (ii) death benefits under any  NorCrown Pension Plan. 

   

   (l)   Except with respect to customary health, life and disability benefits or as  disclosed in the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , there are no unfunded  benefits obligations which are not accounted for by reserves shown on the  NorCrown Financial Statements and established under GAAP, or otherwise noted on  such financial statements. 

   

   (m)   With respect to each NorCrown Pension and Welfare Plan that is funded wholly or  partially through an insurance policy, there will be no liability of NorCrown or  any Subsidiary as of the Effective Time under any such insurance policy or  ancillary agreement with respect to such insurance policy in the nature of a  retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or  contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring prior  to or at the Effective Time. 

   

   (n)   Except as may hereafter be expressly agreed to by Valley in writing or as  disclosed on the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , the consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or  former employee of NorCrown or any Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment  compensation or any similar payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of  payment, accelerate the vesting, or increase the amount, of any compensation or  benefits due to any current employee or former employee under any NorCrown  Pension Plan or NorCrown Welfare Plan.

   (p)   Except as set forth in the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , neither NorCrown  nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or otherwise pays for life insurance  policies (other than group term life policies on employees) with respect to any  director, officer or employee. The _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ lists  each such insurance policy and any agreement with a party other than the insurer  with respect to the payment, funding or assignment of such policy. To  NorCrowns knowledge, neither NorCrown nor any NorCrown Pension Plan or  NorCrown Welfare Plan owns any individual or group insurance policies issued by  an insurer which has been found to be insolvent or is in rehabilitation pursuant  to a state proceeding.

   (a)   Except as disclosed in the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , (i) neither  NorCrown nor any Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any contract or  understanding (whether written or oral) with respect to the employment or  termination of any present or former officers, employees, directors or  consultants and (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts  or events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise)  becoming due from NorCrown or any Subsidiary to any officer, employee, director  or consultant thereof. The _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth true  and correct copies of all such employment agreements or termination agreements  with officers, employees, directors, or consultants to which NorCrown or any  Subsidiary is a party. 

   

16

         (b)   Except as disclosed in the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ (i) as of the  date of this Agreement, neither NorCrown nor any Subsidiary is a party to or  bound by any commitment, agreement or other instrument which contemplates the  payment by NorCrown or any Subsidiary of amounts in excess of $50,000, or which  has a term extending beyond June 30, 2005 and cannot be terminated by NorCrown  or the Subsidiary without consent of the other party thereto, (ii) no  commitment, agreement or other instrument to which NorCrown or any of its  Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound limits the freedom of  NorCrown or any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with  any person, and (iii) neither NorCrown nor any Subsidiary is a party to any  collective bargaining agreement.

NorCrown and its  Subsidiaries, as lessee, has the right under valid and subsisting leases to  occupy, use, possess and control, in all material respects, all real property  leased by it, as presently occupied, used, possessed and controlled by it.

 3.15.   _Environmental Matters_. Except as disclosed in the _NorCrown Disclosure  Schedule_ : 

   

 (a)   Neither NorCrown nor its Subsidiaries have received any written notice,  citation, claim, assessment, proposed assessment or demand for abatement  alleging that NorCrown or its Subsidiaries (either directly or as a trustee or  fiduciary, or as a successor-in-interest in connection with the enforcement of  remedies to realize the value of properties serving as collateral for  outstanding loans) is responsible for the correction or cleanup of any condition  resulting from the violation of any law, ordinance or other governmental  regulation regarding environmental matters, which correction or cleanup would be  material to the business, operations, assets or financial condition of NorCrown  or its Subsidiaries.

 (b)   NorCrown has no knowledge that any of the Properties has been operated in any  manner since the date NorCrown owned, leased or controlled such property that  violated any applicable federal, state or local law or regulation governing or  pertaining to toxic or hazardous substances and materials, the violation of  which would have a Material Adverse Effect on NorCrown. 

   

 (c)   To the knowledge of NorCrown, there are no underground storage tanks on, in or  under any of the Properties and no underground storage tanks have been closed or  removed from any of the Properties while the property was owned, operated or  controlled by NorCrown.

As soon as reasonably available, but in no event more  than 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter (other than the last fiscal  quarter of each fiscal year) ending after the date of this Agreement, NorCrown  will deliver to Valley any financial documentation filed with the Department or  the FDIC and Valley will deliver to NorCrown Valleys quarterly reports on  Form 10-Q, as filed with the SEC under the 1934 Act. 

   

 5.5.   _Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality_. 

   

 (a)   During the Contract Period, NorCrown and the Trust shall permit Valley and its  Representatives and Valley and VNB shall permit NorCrown and its Representatives  (and for purposes of this Section 5.5 references to Representatives of NorCrown  may include representatives of the Trust), reasonable access upon reasonable  notice during regular business hours to their respective properties, and  NorCrown and the Trust shall disclose and shall make available to Valley and its  Representatives and Valley shall disclose and shall make available to NorCrown  and its Representatives, all books, papers and records relating to their  respective assets, stock ownership, properties, operations, obligations and  liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of account (including the  general ledger), tax records, minute books of directors and  stockholders meetings, organizational documents, bylaws, material  contracts and agreements, filings with any regulatory authority, independent  auditors work papers (subject to the receipt by such auditors of a  standard access representation letter), litigation files, plans affecting  employees, and any other business activities or prospects in which Valley and  its Representatives or NorCrown and its Representatives may have a reasonable  interest. No party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose  information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the  rights of any customer or would contravene any law fiduciary duty, binding  agreement, rule, regulation, regulatory policy, order or judgment or, in the  case of a document which is subject to an attorney client privilege, would  compromise the right of the disclosing party to claim that privilege. The  parties will use all reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute  disclosure arrangements, to the fullest extent practicable, under circumstances  in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. NorCrown acknowledges  that Valley may be involved in discussions concerning other potential  acquisitions and Valley shall not be obligated to disclose such information to  NorCrown except as such information is publicly disclosed by Valley. 

   

30

       (b)   All information furnished by the parties hereto previously in connection with  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall be used  solely for the purpose of evaluating the Merger contemplated hereby, shall be  kept confidential and shall be treated as the sole property of the party  delivering the information until consummation of the Merger contemplated hereby  and, if such Merger shall not occur, each party and each partys  Representatives shall return to the other party all documents or other materials  containing, reflecting or referring to such information, will not retain any  copies of such information, shall keep confidential all such information, and  shall not directly or indirectly use such information for any competitive or  commercial purposes or any other purpose not expressing permitted hereby. Each  party hereto shall inform its Representatives of the terms of this Section 5.5.  Any breach of this Section 5.5 by a Representative of a party hereto shall  conclusively be deemed to be a breach thereof by such party. In the event that  the Merger contemplated hereby does not occur or this Agreement is terminated,  all documents, notes and other writings prepared by a party hereto or its  Representatives based on information furnished by the other party, and all other  documents and records obtained from another party hereto in connection herewith,  shall be promptly destroyed. The obligation to keep such information  confidential shall continue for 30 months from the date the proposed Merger is  abandoned but shall not apply to (i) any information which (A) the party or its  Representatives receiving the information can establish by convincing evidence  was already in its possession prior to the disclosure thereof to it by the other  party or its Representatives; (B) was then generally known to the public other  than as a result of a disclosure by any party hereto or its Representatives; (C)  subsequently became known to the public through no fault of the party or its  Representatives receiving such information; or (D) was disclosed to the party or  its Representatives receiving such information by a third party not bound by an  obligation of confidentiality; or (ii) disclosures pursuant to a legal,  regulatory or examination requirement or in accordance with an order of a court  of competent jurisdiction, provided that in the event of any disclosure required  by this clause (ii), the disclosing party will, to the extent practicable, give  reasonable prior written notice of such disclosure to the other parties and  shall not disclose any such information without an opinion of counsel supporting  its position that such information must be disclosed. 

   

 (c)   In addition to all other remedies that may be available to any party hereto in  connection with a breach by any other party hereto of its or its  Representatives obligations under this Section 5.5, each party hereto  shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive and other equitable  relief with respect to this Section 5.5. Each party hereto waives, and agrees to  use all reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to waive, any  requirement to secure or post a bond in connection with any such relief. 

   

 5.6.   _Regulatory Matters_. 

   

 (a)   The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use all reasonable efforts  to prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary filings and to  obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all  third parties and governmental bodies necessary to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement as soon as possible, including, without  limitation, those required by the OCC, the FDIC, the FRB and the Department. The  parties shall each have the right to review in advance and comment on all  information relating to the other, as the case may be, which appears in any  filing made with, or written material submitted to, any third party or  governmental body in connection with the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. Valley and VNB shall use their best efforts to cause their  application to the OCC to be filed within 5 days of the date hereof. NorCrown is  delivering to Valley concurrently with the execution of this Agreement all  information necessary to complete such application based on prior requests  therefor by Valley. Valley shall provide to NorCrown and the Trust drafts of all  filings and applications referred to in this Section 5.6(a) and shall give  NorCrown and the Trust the opportunity to comment thereon prior to their filing. 

   

31

       (b)   During the Contract Period, subject to Section 5.5, each of the parties will  promptly furnish each other with copies of written communications received by  them or any of their respective Subsidiaries from, or delivered by any of the  foregoing to, any governmental body in respect of the applications or notices  seeking approval for the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (c)   Notwithstanding that NorCrown believes that it has established all reserves and  taken all provisions for possible loan losses required by GAAP and applicable  laws, rules and regulations, NorCrown recognizes that VNB may have adopted  different loan, accrual and reserve policies (including loan classifications and  levels of reserves for possible loan losses). During the Contract Period and in  order to formulate the plan of integration for the Merger, NorCrown and VNB  shall consult and cooperate with each other with respect to (i) conforming  to the extent appropriate, based upon such consultation, NorCrowns loan,  accrual and reserve policies and NorCrowns other policies and procedures  regarding applicable regulatory matters, including without limitation Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve, The Bank Secrecy Act and FDIC matters, to  those policies of VNB as VNB may reasonably identify to NorCrown from time to  time, (ii) new extensions of credit by VNB where the aggregate exposure exceeds  $1,000,000, and (iii) conforming, based upon such consultation, the  composition of the investment portfolio and overall asset/liability management  position of NorCrown to the extent appropriate; _provided_ that any  required change in NorCrowns practices in connection with the matters  described in clause (i) or (iii) above need not be effected (A) more than five  days prior to the Effective Time and (B) unless and until all necessary  regulatory, governmental and shareholder approvals and consents have been  received, all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired, Valley  agrees in writing that all conditions precedent to the Closing have occurred  (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other instruments and  documents to be delivered at the Closing). No accrual, reserve or other action  taken, made, or failed to be made or taken, by NorCrown or any NorCrown  Subsidiary pursuant to this subsection, or any litigation or regulatory  proceeding arising out of any such accrual or reserve, shall constitute or be  deemed to be a breach or violation of any representation, warranty, covenant,  condition or other provision of this Agreement or to constitute a termination  event within the meaning of _Article VII_ hereof. 

   

 (d)   During the Contract Period, the Trust agrees to file any and all notices, if  any, required by the Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations promulgated  thereunder and to promptly respond to any inquiries from bank regulatory  authorities concerning the same. The Trust further agrees to make such filings  in a timely fashion so that any required waiting periods will have lapsed on or  before January 31, 2005, and before the Effective Time. The Trust shall provide  Valley copies of all such filings, but need not provide copies of any personal  financial information required by such filings. 

   

32

       5.7.   _Shareholder Approval_. 

   

 (a)   NorCrown will (i) take all steps necessary duly to call, give notice of, convene  and hold a meeting of the shareholders of NorCrown (such meeting or any  adjournment thereof, the "Shareholders Meeting") for the  purpose of securing the approval of the Shareholders of this Agreement and the  Merger, (ii) recommend to the Shareholders the approval of this Agreement and  the Merger, and (iii) cooperate and consult with Valley with respect to each of  the foregoing matters. 

   

 (b)   For the purposes of holding the Shareholders Meeting, NorCrown and VNB shall as  promptly as practicable (i) prepare a proxy statement (the "Proxy  Statement") satisfying all applicable requirements of the National Bank  Act and the New Jersey Banking Act, including, without limitation, the  publication requirement, (ii) make such filings, if any, with the OCC and the  Department as are necessary in connection with the Proxy Statement and the  conduct of the Shareholders Meeting, and (iii) mail such Proxy Statement to the  Shareholders as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 business days of  the date hereof. Valley and its counsel shall have the opportunity to review and  comment on such Proxy Statement prior to mailing to the Shareholders. 

   

 (c)   NorCrown and VNB will promptly furnish the other with copies of written  communications received by it from the OCC or the Department related to the  Proxy Statement and the Shareholders Meeting. 

   

 (d)   Until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, the  Trust shall, at the Shareholders Meeting, vote, or cause to be voted, its shares  of NorCrown Common Stock (i) in favor of the Merger and (ii) against any  Alternative Transaction. 

   

 (e)   The Trust shall not exercise its dissenters rights under Section 215a(b)  of the National Bank Act or Section 140 of the New Jersey Banking Act. 

   

 (f)   Until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, the  Trust shall not transfer any of its shares of NorCrown Common Stock, or any  rights in such shares, to any other person, other than a voting trust required  by any Governmental Entity which is bound by the terms hereof. 

   

 5.8.   _Further Assurances_. 

   

 (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto  agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions  and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or  advisable under applicable laws and regulations to satisfy the conditions to  Closing and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement, including, without limitation, using reasonable efforts to lift  or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely  affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement and using all reasonable efforts to prevent the breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such party contained or  referred to in this Agreement and to promptly remedy the same. Nothing in this  section shall be construed to require any party to participate in any threatened  or actual legal proceedings (other than legal proceedings to which it is  otherwise a party or subject or threatened to be made a party or subject) in  connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  unless such party shall consent in advance and in writing to such participation  and the other party agrees to reimburse and indemnify such party for and against  any and all costs and damages related thereto. 

   

33

       (b)   NorCrown acknowledges that Valley is in or may be in the process of acquiring  other banks and other entities and that in connection with such acquisitions,  information concerning NorCrown may be required to be included in the  registration statements, if any, for the sale of securities of Valley or in SEC  reports in connection with such acquisitions. NorCrown agrees to provide Valley  with any information, certificates, documents or other materials about NorCrown  as are reasonably necessary to be included in such other SEC reports or  registration statements, including registration statements which may be filed by  Valley prior to the Effective Time. NorCrown shall use its reasonable efforts to  cause its attorneys and accountants to provide Valley and any underwriters for  Valley with any consents, comfort letters, opinion letters, reports or  information which are necessary to complete the registration statements and  applications for any such acquisition or issuance of securities. Valley shall  reimburse NorCrown for all expenses thus incurred by NorCrown. Valley shall not  file with the SEC any registration statement or amendment thereto or supplement  thereof containing information regarding NorCrown unless NorCrown shall have  consented in writing to such filing, which consent shall not be unreasonably  delayed or withheld. 

   

 5.9.   _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other  in the development and distribution of all news releases and other public  disclosures with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions  contemplated hereby, except as may be otherwise required by law or regulation or  as to which the party releasing such information has used all reasonable efforts  to discuss with the other party in advance. 

   

 5.10.   _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_. Valley and VNB, on one hand, and NorCrown  and the Trust, on the other hand, shall each use their respective best efforts  to satisfy the Closing conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, as  applicable, and to cause the Closing to occur on or before February 28, 2005. In  the event that Valley or NorCrown reasonably determines that a material  condition to its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby  cannot be fulfilled on or prior to May 31, 2005 (the "Cutoff  Date"), and that it will not waive that condition, it will promptly  notify the other party. NorCrown and Valley will promptly inform the other of  any facts applicable to NorCrown or Valley, respectively, or their respective  directors, officers or Subsidiaries of which NorCrown or Valley, as applicable,  has knowledge, that would be likely to prevent or materially delay approval of  the Merger by any Governmental Entity or which would otherwise prevent or  materially delay completion of the Merger. 

   

 5.11.   _Disclosure Supplements_. Each party hereto will promptly supplement or  amend (by written notice to the other) its respective Disclosure Schedules  delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if  existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been  required to be set forth or described in such Schedules or which is necessary to  correct any information in such Schedules which has been rendered materially  inaccurate thereby. For the purpose of determining satisfaction of the  conditions set forth in Article VI, no supplement or amendment to such Schedules  shall correct or cure any warranty which was untrue when made, but supplements  or amendments may be used to disclose subsequent facts or events to maintain the  truthfulness of any warranty. 

   

34

       5.12.   _Indemnification by Valley_. 

   

 (a)   For a period of six years after the Effective Time, subject to Section 6.2(f),  Valley shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has  been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective  Time, any person entitled to indemnification under the NorCrown Governing  Documents (collectively, the "NorCrown Indemnitees") against  any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, charges, expenses  (including, without limitation, reasonable costs of investigation, and the  reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel and other advisers and  experts as incurred), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement  or other liability, asserted against, incurred by or imposed upon any NorCrown  Indemnitee ("Costs") by reason of the fact that he or she is or  was a director or officer of NorCrown or another person entitled to  indemnification under the NorCrown Governing Documents, in connection with,  arising out of or relating to any threatened, pending or completed claim,  action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or  investigative) (each a "Claim" and collectively,  "Claims"), including without limitation any Claim which is  based upon, arises out of or in any way relates to the Merger, this Agreement,  any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the NorCrown  Indemnitees service as a member of the Board of Directors of NorCrown or  any committee thereof, the events leading up to the execution of this Agreement,  any statement, announcement, recommendation or solicitation made in connection  therewith or related thereto and any breach of any duty in connection with any  of the foregoing, in each case to the fullest extent which NorCrown would have  been permitted under any applicable law and its Governing Documents had the  Merger not occurred (and Valley shall also advance expenses, including, but not  limited to, fees and disbursements of legal counsel as incurred to the extent  permitted under NorCrowns Governing Documents). 

   

 (b)   From and after the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and honor any obligation  of NorCrown immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the  indemnification of the NorCrown Indemnitees arising out of the Governing  Documents of NorCrown or arising out of any written indemnification agreements  between NorCrown and such persons disclosed in the _NorCrown Disclosure  Schedule_ , as if such obligations were pursuant to a contract or arrangement  between Valley and such NorCrown Indemnitees. 

   

 (c)   In the event Valley or any of its successors or assigns (i) reorganizes or  consolidates with or merges into or enters into another business combination  transaction with any other person or entity and is not the resulting, continuing  or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation, merger or transaction,  or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or transfers all or substantially all of its  properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case,  proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Valley  assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.12. 

   

 (d)   Valley shall cause NorCrowns officers and directors to be covered, for a  period of six years after the Effective Time, at Valleys option, under (i)  Valleys then current officers and directors liability  insurance policy (provided that Valleys then current policy provides  substantially similar coverage to NorCrowns officers and directors as they  receive under NorCrowns current liability insurance policy), or (ii) an  extension of NorCrowns existing officers and directors  liability insurance policy. 

   

35

       (e)   Any NorCrown Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.12  shall promptly notify Valley upon learning of any Claim, but the failure to so  notify shall not relieve Valley of any liability it may have to such NorCrown  Indemnitee if such failure does not materially prejudice Valley. In the event of  any Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) as to which  indemnification under this Section 5.12 is applicable, (x) Valley shall have the  right to assume the defense thereof and Valley shall not be liable to such  NorCrown Indemnitees for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other  expenses subsequently incurred by such NorCrown Indemnitee in connection with  the defense thereof, except that if Valley elects not to assume such defense, or  counsel for the NorCrown Indemnitees advises that there are issues which raise  conflicts of interest between Valley and the NorCrown Indemnitees, the NorCrown  Indemnitees may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Valley shall pay the  reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the NorCrown Indemnitees as  statements therefor are received; _provided, however_ , that Valley shall be  obligated pursuant to this Section 5.12(e) to pay for only one firm of counsel  for all NorCrown Indemnitees in any jurisdiction with respect to a matter unless  the use of one counsel for multiple NorCrown Indemnitees would present such  counsel with a conflict of interest that is not waivable by the NorCrown  Indemnitees, and (y) the NorCrown Indemnitees will cooperate in the defense of  any such matter. Valley shall not be liable for settlement of any claim, action  or proceeding hereunder unless such settlement is effected with its prior  written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Section 5.12, Valley shall not have any  obligation hereunder to any NorCrown Indemnitee when and if a court of competent  jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have  become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such NorCrown  Indemnitee in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law or  public policy. 

   

 5.13.   _Securities Law Compliance; Affiliates_. Each Shareholder electing to  receive the Per Share Cash/Stock Consideration shall have signed an Investor  Certificate in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ (or _Exhibit B_   in the case of the Trust) acknowledging that the shares of Valley Common Stock  to be issued in the Merger have not been registered, and in connection with the  Merger will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  "1933 Act") and, therefore, cannot be resold unless they are  registered under the 1933 Act or unless an exemption from registration is  available, that the Shareholder will acquire such Valley Common Stock for its or  his own account for the purpose of investment, that the Shareholder is an  Accredited Investor, as that term is used in the regulations promulgated under  the 1933 Act, and that the Shareholder will refrain from transferring or  otherwise disposing of any of the NorCrown Common Stock, or any interest  therein, prior to the Merger except as may be required to comply with any order  or direction from the FRB and the FDIC or the Department, or to comply with any  other federal or state legal or regulatory requirement, or from transferring or  otherwise disposing of any of the Valley Common Stock he or it receives in the  Merger, or any interest therein, in such manner as to cause Valley to be in  violation of the registration requirements of the 1933 Act, or applicable state  securities or blue sky laws. The Trust, each current director of NorCrown and  Charles Kushner shall execute an Investor Certificate within 10 days of the date  hereof. 

   

 5.14.   _Compliance with the Industrial Site Recovery Act_. NorCrown shall obtain  prior to the Effective Time, either: (a) a Letter of Non-Applicability from  the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP")  stating that none of the facilities located in New Jersey owned or operated by  NorCrown (each, a "Facility") is an "industrial  establishment," as such term is defined under the Industrial Site Recovery  Act ("ISRA"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the NJDEP  informs NorCrown in writing that it will not issue a Letter of Non-Applicability  by reason of the fact that the property and/or the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement fall into a category that is "unmistakably exempt" from  ISRA, NorCrowns obligation under this clause shall be deemed to have been  satisfied upon receipt of such letter from the NJDEP; (b) a Remediation  Agreement issued by the NJDEP pursuant to ISRA authorizing the consummation of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (c) a Negative Declaration  approval, Remedial Action Workplan approval, de minimus quantity exemption, an  approval pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:26B-5.1 through 5.8, a No Further Action letter  or other document or documents issued by the NJDEP that satisfies the  requirements of ISRA with respect to each Facility subject to ISRA. In the event  NorCrown obtains a Remediation Agreement, NorCrown will post or have posted an  appropriate Remediation Funding Source or will have obtained the NJDEPs  approval to self guaranty any Remediation Funding Source required under any such  Remediation Agreement. 

   

36

       5.15.   _Employees_ Following consummation of the Merger, Valley shall make  available to all employees and officers of NorCrown who become employed by VNB  coverage under the benefit plans generally available to VNBs employees and  officers (including pension and health and hospitalization) on the terms and  conditions available to VNBs employees and officers with no uninsured  waiting periods for enrollment in Valley or VNB medical and dental plans for  NorCrown employees and their dependents. In addition, Valley and VNB shall  assume responsibility for compliance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended, and the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, including without limitation notices and  continuation coverage, relating to each employee and officer of NorCrown who  does not accept or receive an offer of continued employment from Valley or VNB  following consummation of the Merger. As soon as administratively feasible  following the consummation of the Merger, the sponsor of the NorCrown 401(k)  Plan (the "the 401(k) Plan") shall do everything necessary to  transfer the account balances of NorCrown employees in the 401(k) Plan to the  Valley National Bancorp Savings and Incentive Plan, and Valley and VNB shall  take such actions as shall be reasonably necessary to facilitate such transfer.  NorCrown employees will be given credit under Valleys or VNBs  medical, life, vacation, sick leave, disability and other welfare plans for  prior service with NorCrown, and NorCrowns employees will be granted  credit for prior service with NorCrown, solely for purposes of eligibility and  vesting (but not accrual of benefits) under Valleys or VNBs pension  and 401(k) plans. 

   

 5.16.   _Demand Registration Rights_. At the closing Valley and the Trust will  execute and deliver a registration rights agreement (the "Registration  Rights Agreement") in the form of _Exhibit C_ , annexed hereto, to  provide the Shareholders with certain rights and Valley with certain obligations  to register for resale the shares of Valley common stock to be issued in  connection with the merger. 

   

 5.17.   _Stay Bonuses and Severance_. 

   

   (a)   Following consummation of the Merger, Valley and VNB will use their best efforts  to retain the existing employees of NorCrown in their same or similar positions. 

   

37

         (b)   Following the consummation of the Merger and for one year thereafter, Valley and  VNB shall, to the extent not duplicative of other severance benefits, honor  NorCrowns severance policy as specified on the _NorCrown Disclosure  Schedule_. 

   

   (c)   On the 90th day following the Closing Date (or sooner as provided for  below), Valley or VNB will pay stay bonuses in the aggregate amount of $495,000  to the persons and in such respective amounts as are set forth on the  _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ , _provided_ , _however_ , that such  persons have executed and delivered to NorCrown and Valley a Stay Bonus  Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ , and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in the event Valley or VNB terminates any employees  eligible for a stay bonus prior to the 90th day following the Closing  Date for any reason other than Cause (as such term in defined in the Stay Bonus  Agreement), Valley shall promptly pay such employee the bonus listed for such  person on the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_. 

   

   (d)   As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Valley, VNB and NorCrown will  use their best efforts to cause each of the officers of NorCrown listed on the  _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ with existing change in control agreements  to execute a Clarification Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit _ E. To the extent that such officers do not execute such Clarification  Agreements, Valley and VNB will honor the existing written change in control  contracts with such officers. 

   

 5.18 Transaction Expenses of NorCrown. 

   

   (a)   NorCrown shall, within 10 days from the date hereof, provide Valley with (i) the  amount of legal fees and expenses related to this transaction which NorCrown,  the Trust or the Board of Directors of NorCrown have incurred since August 1,  2004 and (ii) the amount of future legal fees and expenses related to this  transaction which are reasonably anticipated to be payable by NorCrown, the  Trust or the Board of Directors of NorCrown based on facts and circumstances  currently known (collectively, "Legal Fees").

   (b)   For planning purposes, NorCrown shall, within 30 days from the date hereof,  provide Valley with its estimated budget of transaction-related expenses  reasonably anticipated to be payable by NorCrown in connection with this  transaction (other than Legal Fees) based on facts and circumstances currently  known, including the fees and expenses of accountants and other professionals.  NorCrown shall promptly notify Valley if or when it determines that it will  expect to exceed its budget. Prior to signing this Agreement, NorCrown has  disclosed to Valley the method by which the fees of its counsel in connection  with this transaction are to be determined, and has disclosed to Valley the fees  of its counsel in connection with this transaction through a recent date. 

   

   (c)   Promptly, but in any event within 15 days after the execution of this Agreement,  NorCrown shall ask all of its attorneys and other professionals to render  current and correct invoices for all unbilled time and disbursements.

ARTICLE VI

   

CLOSING CONDITIONS

   

 6.1.   _Conditions of Each Party s Obligations Under this Agreement_. The  respective obligations of each party under this Agreement to consummate the  Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction, or, where permissible under  applicable law, waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of the following  conditions: 

   

 (a)   _Blue Sky Qualification_. The issuance of the Valley Common Stock in the  Merger shall have been qualified in any state where such qualification is  required under the applicable state securities laws. 

   

 (b)   _Regulatory Filings_. All necessary regulatory or governmental approvals  and consents (including without limitation any required approval of the  Department, the FDIC, the FRB or the OCC) required to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained without any term or  condition which would materially impair the value of NorCrown to Valley. All  conditions required to be satisfied prior to the Effective Time by the terms of  such approvals and consents shall have been satisfied; and all statutory waiting  periods in respect thereof shall have expired. 

   

 (c)   _Suits and Proceedings_. No order, judgment or decree shall be outstanding  against a party hereto or a third party that would prevent completion of the  Merger; no legal proceeding shall be pending or threatened by any Governmental  Entity or pending by a third party in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit  the Merger and no legal proceeding shall be pending before any court or  Governmental Entity in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit the Merger or  obtain other substantial monetary or other relief against one or more parties  hereto in connection with this Agreement and which Valley or NorCrown determines  in good faith, based upon the written advice of their respective counsel, makes  it inadvisable to proceed with the Merger because any such legal proceeding has  a significant potential to be resolved in such a way as to deprive the party  electing not to proceed of any of the material benefits to it of the Merger. 

   

 (d)   _Tax Opinion_. NorCrown and the Trust shall each have received an opinion  of Pitney Hardin LLP reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to NorCrown  and its counsel, and to the Trust and its counsel, based, in each case, upon  representation letters required by Pitney Hardin LLP, dated on or about the date  of such opinion, and such other facts and representations as counsel may  reasonably deem relevant, to the effect that: (i) the Merger will be treated for  federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" qualifying under the  provisions of Section 368 of the Code; (ii) no gain or loss will be  recognized by the Shareholders upon the exchange of NorCrown Common Stock solely  for Valley Common Stock; (iii) gain (but not loss), if any, realized by the  Shareholders upon the exchange of NorCrown Common Stock will be recognized upon  their receipt of the Per Share Cash Consideration but not in an amount in excess  of the amount of the Per Share Cash Consideration received by such Shareholder;  and (iv) in the case of the receipt by the Shareholders of cash in lieu of  fractional shares in exchange for their NorCrown Common Stock, gain, if any,  realized by the recipient on the exchange shall be recognized but in an amount  not in excess of the amount of cash received. The tax opinions of Pitney Hardin  LLP, summarized above are or will be based, among other things, on  representations contained in certificates of the Trust and officers of NorCrown  and Valley.

NorCrown and the Trust shall have performed  in all material respects the agreements, covenants and obligations necessary to  be performed by each of them prior to the Closing Date. With respect to any  representation or warranty which as of the Closing Date has required a  supplement or amendment to the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ or the  _Trust Disclosure Schedule_ to render such representation or warranty true  and correct as of the Closing Date, the representation and warranty shall be  deemed true and correct as of the Closing Date only if (i) the information  contained in the supplement or amendment to the _NorCrown Disclosure  Schedule_ or the _Trust Disclosure Schedule_ related to events occurring  following the execution of this Agreement and (ii) the facts disclosed in such  supplement or amendment would not either alone, or together with any other  supplements or amendments to the _NorCrown Disclosure Schedule_ or the  _Trust Disclosure Schedule_ , materially adversely effect the representation  as to which the supplement or amendment relates. 

   

 (b)   _Consents_. Valley shall have received the written consents of any person  whose consent to the transactions contemplated hereby is required under the  applicable instrument. 

   

40

 (e)   _FRB_. NorCrown shall have received a written release, in the language  previously provided by the Trust to Valley in writing, from the FRB from any and  all liability related to the investigation by the FRB into the status of the  Trust as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as  amended. 

   

 (f)   _Directors of NorCrown_. Each member of the Board of Directors of NorCrown  and Charles Kushner shall have executed and delivered to NorCrown a Closing  Certificate in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_.

 (a)   _Representations and Warranties; Performance of Obligations of Valley and  VNB_. The representations and warranties of Valley and VNB contained in this  Agreement, other than representations and warranties which are expressly stated  to be made as of the date hereof or as of any other particular date, shall be  true and correct in all material respects on the Closing Date as though made on  and as of the Closing Date unless the failure of such representation(s) or  warranty(ies) to be true and correct would not, individually or in the  aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Valley. Valley and VNB shall have  performed in all material respects, the agreements, covenants and obligations to  be performed by them prior to the Closing Date. With respect to any  representation or warranty which as of the Closing Date has required a  supplement or amendment to the _Valley Disclosure Schedule_ to render such  representation or warranty true and correct as of the Closing Date, the  representation and warranty shall be deemed true and correct as of the Closing  Date only if (i) the information contained in the supplement or amendment to the  _Valley Disclosure Schedule_ related to events occurring following the  execution of this Agreement and (ii) the facts disclosed in such supplement or  amendment would not either alone, or together with any other supplements or  amendments to the _Valley Disclosure Schedule_ , materially adversely effect  the representation as to which the supplement or amendment relates.

TERMINATION

   

 7.1   _Permissive Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the Trust:

   

   (a)   by mutual consent of NorCrown, the Trust, Valley and VNB; 

   

   (b)   by either Valley and VNB, on one hand, or the Trust, on the other hand, upon  written notice to the other party (i) 60 days after the date on which any  request or application for a required regulatory approval shall have been denied  or withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which  must grant such approval, unless within the 60-day period following such denial  or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed  with the applicable Governmental Entity, provided, however, that no party shall  have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) if  such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the  failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe  the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein or the falsity of  any of the representations or warranties of such party set forth herein or (ii)  if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final  nonappealable order enjoining (other than on a temporary basis) or otherwise  prohibiting the Merger; 

   

   (c)   by either Valley and VNB, on one hand, or the Trust, on the other hand, if the  Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the Cutoff Date, unless the  failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the  party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants  and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

   

   (d)   by either Valley and VNB, on one hand, or the Trust, on the other hand, if a  vote of Shareholders of NorCrown has been taken and such Shareholders fail to  approve this Agreement and the Merger at the Shareholders Meeting, unless in the  case of an attempted termination under this Section 7.1(d) by the Trust, the  failure of the Shareholders to approve this Agreement and the Merger shall be  due to the failure of NorCrown to perform or observe the covenants and  agreements of NorCrown set forth herein. 

   

   (e)   by either Valley and VNB, on one hand, or the Trust, on the other hand,  (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if  there shall have been a breach of any of the representations or warranties set  forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party (or, in the case of  termination by Valley, NorCrown), which breach is not cured within thirty days  following written notice to the party (and, in the case of termination by  Valley, NorCrown) committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot  be cured prior to the Closing and which breach of a representation or warranty,  would, individually or in the aggregate with other breaches, result in a  Material Adverse Effect on the party committing such breach. 

   

42

         (f)   by either Valley and VNB, on one hand, or the Trust, on the other hand (provided  that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,  warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have  been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this  Agreement on the part of the other party hereto (or, in the case of termination  by Valley, NorCrown), which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days  following receipt by the breaching party (and, in the case of termination by  Valley, NorCrown) of written notice of such breach from the other party hereto,  or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; 

   

   (g)   by Valley and VNB if the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 are not  satisfied and Valley reasonably determines that one or more of such conditions  are not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff Date; or 

   

   (h)   by the Trust if the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 are not  satisfied and the Trust reasonably determines that one or more of such  conditions are not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff Date. 

   

 7.2 _Mandatory Termination_. This Agreement shall be terminated automatically in the event that the number of shares of Valley Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement, as determined at the Closing, equals or exceeds twenty percent of the shares of Valley Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of the Closing. 

   

 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated by either Valley or the Trust as provided in Section 7.1 or automatically as provided in Section 7.2, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect except that (i) Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that either of the parties shall willfully default in its obligations hereunder, the non-defaulting party may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity to enforce its rights and shall be paid by the willfully defaulting party for all damages, costs and expenses, including without limitation legal, accounting, investment banking and printing expenses, incurred or suffered by the non-defaulting party in connection herewith or in the enforcement of its rights hereunder. 

   

ARTICLE VIII

   

INDEMNIFICATION OF VALLEY

   

 8.1 _Survival_. The indemnification obligations of the Trust under this Article VIII shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the Merger for a period of one year after the Effective Time. The right of Valley to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy under this Article VIII shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Effective Time. The expiration of any indemnification obligations in this Section 8.1 shall not affect the rights of a Valley Indemnitee (as hereinafter defined) in respect of any claim made by such Valley Indemnitee in writing prior to the expiration of the survival period specified above. 

   

43

       8.2   _Indemnification and Reimbursement by the Trust_. 

   

 (a)   Subject to Section 8.2(c), the Trust will indemnify and hold harmless Valley and  its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors and employees of each of them  (collectively, the "Valley Indemnitees"), and will reimburse  the Valley Indemnitees for any and all damages, losses, liabilities, claims and  expenses of defense thereof, including diminution of value, whether or not  involving a third-party claim (collectively, "Damages"),  arising from or in connection with: 

   

   (1)   provided that Valley does not waive either of the closing conditions set forth  in Section 6.2(d) or (e), any violations of state or federal banking laws or  regulations, orders, policies and or guidelines of any Governmental Entity by  NorCrown or its Subsidiaries or the Trust occurring prior to the Effective Time; 

   

   (2)   any Taxes, fines or penalties paid or payable by NorCrown or its Subsidiaries  which was not accrued by NorCrown in the NorCrown Unaudited Statements due to  any improper deductions or political contributions made by NorCrown, its  Subsidiaries or the Trust prior to the Effective Time; 

   

   (3)   any Legal Fees which are in excess of the $100,000 limitation set forth in  Section 5.18(a), provided that in the event such fees are deemed to cause a  Closing Statement Deficit, Valley shall be entitled to payment either pursuant  to the terms of Section 2.1(e)(4) or hereunder, but not both; 

   

   (4)   any payments made to, or the advancement of expenses made or behalf of, the  NorCrown Indemnitees or any other person entitled to indemnification under the  NorCrown Governing Documents pursuant to Section 5.12 arising as a result of  (x) any Claim which is brought by or on behalf of or in the right of  NorCrown or any of its former or present Shareholders or affiliates (y) any  Claim which relates to (A) a violation or alleged violation of law or regulation  by a NorCrown Indemnitee or (B) a violation or alleged violation of the MOU or  any other regulatory order applicable to NorCrown or the Trust, or (z) any claim  which relates to a personal benefit improperly paid or provided, or alleged to  have been improperly paid or provided, to the NorCrown Indemnitee, but with  respect to Claims described in clause (y) or (z) above Valley shall reimburse  the Trust for costs incurred by the NorCrown Indemnitee with respect to such  Claim when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine,  and such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that the  NorCrown Indemnitee did not violate such law or regulation or was not improperly  paid or provided with the personal benefit alleged in the Claim, as the case may  be; and 

   

44

         (5)   any amounts required to be paid by Valley under Section 5.12(d)(ii) which are in  excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by NorCrown for such  coverage. 

   

   (6)   any costs, losses or expenses incurred by Valley due to any action, claim or  proceeding brought against Valley, VNB or Norcrown by any beneficiary or alleged  beneficiary of the Trust. 

   

 (b)   The indemnification rights provided for hereunder will only be satisfied out of,  and are limited to claims in the amount of, the Indemnification Escrow Shares  (as defined below). Neither Valley nor VNB shall have any claim, for  indemnification or otherwise, against NorCrown, its officers, directors or  employees regarding any representation, warranty or covenant of NorCrown made  herein. 

   

 (c)   Indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(1) shall be paid only  on the Release Date (as defined below) and shall be subordinated to any and all  indemnification payments previously paid, or claimed by Valley, on the Release  Date, pursuant to any other subsection of Section 8.2(a). 

   

 8.3 _Notice to the Trust_. Any Valley Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this Article VIII shall promptly notify the Trust upon learning of any claim or other Damages, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Trust of any liability it may have to such Valley Indemnitee if such failure does not materially prejudice the Trust. 

   

 8.4 _Indemnification Escrow Agreement and Indemnification Escrow Fund_. At the Effective Time the Trust agrees that Valley shall deduct from the Valley Common Stock payable to the Trust under Section 2.1(a), and shall deposit into an escrow account with an escrow agent to be mutually agreed to by the Valley and the Trust prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnification Escrow Agent"), shares of Valley Common Stock (the "Indemnification Escrow Shares"), in such amount equal to $5 million based upon the Average Closing Price, with instructions to the Indemnification Escrow Agent to hold such shares and all dividends and distributions thereon, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in an escrow agreement to be mutually agreed to by Valley and the Trust prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnification Escrow Agreement"), which shall be executed at, or promptly following, the Closing by Valley, the Trust and the Indemnification Escrow Agent. 

   

45

         The Indemnification Escrow Shares are the "Indemnification Escrow Fund". Subject to this Section 8.4, the Indemnification Escrow Shares, and all dividends and distributions thereon, will remain in the Indemnification Escrow Fund until the Release Date. The Indemnification Escrow Agents fees shall be borne by the Trust. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Fund shall be used to satisfy the Trusts obligations, if any, to indemnify the Valley Indemnitees in accordance with this Article VIII and to pay to Valley the Closing Statement Deficit, if any, payable in accordance with Section 2.1(e). On the one year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Release Date"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall pay to the Trust that portion of the Indemnification Escrow Fund remaining on deposit with the Indemnification Escrow Agent, less shares of Valley Common Stock, and all dividends and distributions thereon, equal in amount to (i) any pending claim of any Valley Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, (ii) to the extent not yet paid as of the Release Date, any claim of any Valley Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII and which has been finally determined in favor of the Valley Indemnitee, and (iii) any amounts reasonably estimated by Valley to become due thereafter as a result of continuing claims of any NorCrown Indemnitee. Shares remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund following the Release Date shall be applied, first, to claims of any Valley Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII which were ending on the Release Date and which were subsequently finally determined in favor of the Valley Indemnitee and, second, after all such claims have been paid in full or otherwise settled, to the Trust.

   WHEREAS, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger (as defined below), Shareholders were the owners of shares of common stock in NorCrown Bank, a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of New Jersey (the " _NorCrown_ ") set forth opposite their names on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto; 

   

   WHEREAS, the Shareholders have been issued Common Shares (defined below) in connection with the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of NorCrown with and into Valley National Bank (" _VNB_ "), a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of New Jersey and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valley, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 9, 2004, (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among Valley, VNB, NorCrown, and the Trust;

   (b) _Expenses._   Valley shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with a  registration pursuant to this Agreement. The Shareholders shall pay all  underwriting discounts and commissions relating to the Shares, the fees and  disbursements of counsel representing the Shareholders, the fees and  disbursements of counsel representing any underwriters relating to Shares,  transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of Shares by  the Shareholders and any other expenses of the Shareholders not included in  the definition of Registration Expenses. Such expenses shall be allocated  among the Shareholders in proportion to their holding of Shares.  

   

   (c) _Subsequent  Registration_. If the Initial Registration or any Subsequent  Registration ceases to be effective for any reasons at any time during the  Effectiveness Period (other than because of the sale of all of the  securities registered thereunder), Valley shall use its best efforts to  obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness  thereof, and in any event shall within 30 days of such cessation of  effectiveness amend the Registration in a manner to obtain the withdrawal  of the order suspending the effectiveness thereof, or file an additional  "shelf" Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 covering all  of the Shares (a " _Subsequent Registration_ "). If a  Subsequent Registration is filed, Valley shall use its best efforts to  cause the Subsequent Registration to be declared effective as soon as  practicable after such filing and to keep such Subsequent Registration  continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period. As used herein, the  term _"Registration_ " means the Initial Registration  and any Subsequent Registration. 

   

   3. _Registration  Procedures_. In connection with the obligations of Valley under  Section 2 hereof, Valley shall: 

   

   (a)   prepare and file with the SEC, within the time period set forth in Section  2 hereof, and use its best efforts to have declared effective by the SEC,  the Registration Statement, which shall (i) be available for public resale  of the Shares by the Shareholders; and (ii) comply as to form in all  material respects with the requirements of the applicable form and include  all financial statements required by the SEC to be filed therewith;  

   

   (b)   (i) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments to the Registration  Statement as may be necessary to keep it effective for the effectiveness  period; (ii) cause any Prospectus to be amended or supplemented as  required and to be filed as required by Rule 424 or any similar rule that  may be adopted under the Securities Act; and (iii) respond as promptly as  practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to the  Registration Statement or any amendment thereto; 

   

   (c)   furnish to the Shareholders, upon request and without charge, as many  copies of any Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus  and any amendment or supplement thereto as the Shareholders may reasonably  request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the  Shares; 

   

54

         (d)   use its best efforts to register or qualify the Shares under all applicable  state securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the United  States and its territories and possessions as the Shareholders may  reasonably request in writing and keep such registration or qualification  effective during the period the Registration Statement is required to be  kept effective; _provided, however_ , that in connection therewith,  Valley shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation to do  business or to register as a broker or dealer in any such jurisdiction  where it would not otherwise be required to qualify or register but for  this section 3(d), or (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such  jurisdiction with respect to such registration or qualification;  

   

   (e)   notify the Shareholders promptly and, if requested by the Shareholders,  confirm in writing, (i) when the Registration Statement and any  post-effective amendments thereto have become effective, (ii) when any  amendment or supplement to a Prospectus has been filed with the SEC, (iii)  of the issuance by the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop  order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any  part thereof or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) if  Valley receives any notification with respect to the suspension of the  qualification of the Shares for offer or sale in any jurisdiction or the  initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) the identity and contact  information for the registrar and/or transfer agent for the Shares together  with instructions relating to the delivery by the Shareholders of the  Shares to be held for sale pursuant to the Registration Statement, and (vi)  of the happening of any event during the period the Registration Statement  is effective as a result of which (A) the Registration Statement contains  any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein  not misleading or (B) a Prospectus as then amended or supplemented contains  any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact  necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 

   

   (f)   use best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the  effectiveness of the Registration Statement by the SEC or any state  securities authority as promptly as possible; 

   

   (g)   furnish to the Shareholders upon request, without charge, at least one  conformed copy of the Registration Statement and any post-effective  amendment thereto (without documents incorporated therein by reference or  exhibits thereto); 

   

   (h)   cooperate with the Shareholders to facilitate the timely preparation and  delivery of certificates representing Shares to be sold and not bearing any  Securities Act legend and enable certificates for such Shares to be issued  for such numbers of Shares and registered in such names as the Shareholders  may reasonably request; 

   

   (i)   cause all Shares registered pursuant hereunder to be listed on the  securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar  securities issued by Valley are then listed. 

   

55

         4. _Certain  Agreements of the Shareholders._ The Shareholders agree to furnish  to Valley in writing such information regarding the Shareholders and their  proposed distribution of Shares as Valley may from time to time reasonably  request in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or  the registration or qualification of the Shares under state securities or  blue sky laws. 

   

   5.   _Indemnification, Contribution_.

   

   (a) _Indemnification by Valley._ Valley agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholders and their assigns as follows: 

   

      (i) subject to the limitation set forth in Section 5(c), against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to which the Shareholders may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise (A) that arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto or any related filing, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) that arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 

   

      (ii) subject to the limitation set forth in Section 5(c), against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, any omission or alleged omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of Valley; and 

   

      (iii) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c), against any and all expense (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, in each case whether or not a party, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission that relates to the sale by the Shareholders of Shares under the Registration Statement, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above or (d) below; 

   

 _provided, however_ , that the indemnity provided pursuant to this Section
5(a) shall not apply to any Shareholder with respect to any loss, liability,
claim, damage or expense that arises out of or is based solely upon (1) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to Valley by any Shareholder with respect to any such Shareholder for use in
the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto or a Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto or (2) trades made by any Shareholder in
violation of section 6(a) below or (3) trades made by any Shareholder in
violation of the prospectus delivery requirements of Section 5(b) of the
Securities Act. This indemnity in Section 5(a) is in addition to any
liability which Valley may otherwise have.

   

56

       
--- 
      

* * *

           

   (b) _Indemnification by the Shareholders._ Each Shareholder (with respect to that particular Shareholder and the Shares owned by that particular Shareholder) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Valley, each director of Valley, each officer of Valley who signed the Registration Statement and each other Person, if any, who controls Valley within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, to the same extent as the indemnity contained in Section 5(a) hereof, but only insofar as such loss, liability, claim damage or expense arises out of or is based solely upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto or a Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Valley by the Shareholder with respect to the Shareholder for use therein or (ii) trades made by the Shareholder in violation of Section 6(a) below or (iii) trades made by the Shareholder in violation of the prospectus delivery requirements of Section 5(b) of the Securities Act or (iv) any sale of Shares by the Shareholder at any time prohibited by this Agreement; _provided,_ that, in the case of the Shareholders obligation set forth in this Section 5(b) relating to Section 5(a)(ii) above, such settlement must be effected with the written  consent of the Shareholder. 

   

   (c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings._ The indemnified party shall give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party (i) shall not relieve it from any liability that  it may have under the indemnity agreement provided in Section 5(a) or (b) above, unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and the lack of notice by the indemnified party prejudices the indemnifying party or results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) shall not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided under Section 5(a) or (b) above. After receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, at its option, jointly with any other indemnifying party so notified, to assume the defense of such action or proceeding at such indemnifying partys own expense with counsel chosen by such indemnifying party; _provided, however_ , that, if the defendants in any such action or proceeding include both an indemnified party and an indemnifying party and the indemnified party reasonably determines, upon advice of counsel, that a conflict of interest exists or that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying parties, then the indemnified parties shall be entitled to counsel (which shall be limited to a single law firm for all indemnified parties) the reasonable fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the indemnifying parties. If the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of any such action or proceeding, after having received the notice referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying parties will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (which will be limited to a single law firm for all indemnified parties) for the indemnified parties. In such event, however, no indemnifying party will be liable for any settlement effected without the prior written consent of such indemnifying party. If one or more of the indemnifying parties assumes the defense of any such action or proceeding in accordance with this paragraph, such indemnifying party shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action or proceeding except as set forth in the proviso in the second sentence of this Section 5(c). 

   

57

         _(d) Contribution._

   

       (i) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Section 5 is for any reason held to be unenforceable although applicable in accordance with its terms, the indemnifying parties shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnity agreement incurred by the indemnified party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of and benefits to each indemnifying party and each indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claim, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits to the indemnifying parties and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the total proceeds received by each indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the offering to which such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses relate. The relative fault of each indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties relative intent, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. 

   

      (ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 5(d)(i) above. 

   

      (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 5(d), each director of Valley, each officer of Valley who signed the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls Valley within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Valley. 

   

   (e) Notwithstanding any term or condition to the contrary, the liability of a Shareholder pursuant to this Section 5 shall be limited to the gross proceeds received by such Shareholder as a result of the sale giving rise to the liability. 

   

   (f) The obligations of Valley and the Shareholders under this Section 5 shall survive the completion of any offering of the Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement. 

   

58

* * *

           

   6.   _Suspension of Registration Requirement_.

   

   (a)   Immediately prior to any anticipated sale of the Shares by a Shareholder  subject to the Registration Statement, the Shareholder shall notify Valley  in writing of the anticipated sale of the Shares. Each Shareholder agrees  that he will not effect any sales of Shares pursuant to the Registration  Statement after the Shareholder has received notice from Valley to suspend  sales as a result of the occurrence or existence of any Suspension Event  (as defined in section 6(b) below) until Valley provides written notice to  the Shareholder that all Suspension Events have ceased to exist. Each  Shareholder agrees that he will not effect any sales of Shares pursuant to  the Registration Statement after the Shareholder has received notice from  Valley to suspend sales because the Registration Statement, any Prospectus  or any supplement thereto contains an untrue statement of a material fact  or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements  therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not  misleading, until Valley notifies the Shareholder that the misstatement or  omission has been corrected. Valley agrees that the period of time during  which the Registration Statement must be kept effective pursuant to clause  (i) of Section 2(a) shall be extended by a period which is not less than  the aggregate number of days during which any suspension under this Section  6(a) or any Suspension Event is in effect. 

   

   (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,  Valleys obligation to file the Registration Statement and make any  filings with any state securities authority, to use its best efforts to  cause the Registration Statement or any state securities filings to become  effective or to remain effective, or to amend or supplement the  Registration Statement or any state securities filings shall be suspended  in the event of and during a Suspension Event. A " _Suspension  Event_ " shall exist at such times as circumstances exist  that Valley determines in good faith, on advice of counsel, that the  filing, amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or such  filings or the causing of the Registration Statement or such filings to  become effective or to remain effective or for the sale of Shares to occur  under the Registration Statement shall require disclosure under applicable  securities laws of material information in the Registration Statement (or  any other document incorporated into the Registration Statement by  reference) or such state securities filings as to which Valley has a bona  fide business purpose for preserving confidentiality or which renders  Valley unable to comply with SEC requirements. Valley shall notify the  Shareholders promptly after any Suspension Event occurs or ceases to exist.  Suspension of Valleys obligations pursuant to this Section 6(b) shall  continue for so long as a Suspension Event or its effect is continuing.  

   

   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Shareholders may sell their Shares at any time, regardless of the existence of a Suspension Event, so long as the Shareholders comply with Rule 144 in effecting any sale of the Shares. 

   

   7.   _Miscellaneous_.

   

   (a) _Amendments and Waivers._ The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified, supplemented or waived, nor may consent to departures therefrom be given, without the written consent of Valley and each Shareholder, provided, however, that any amendment hereunder shall be effective as to any Shareholder who consents or agrees to such amendment regardless of whether the other Shareholders have also consented or agreed thereto. 

   

59

          (b) _Notices._ Unless otherwise provided, all notices or other communications required or permitted to be given to the parties hereto shall be in writing and shall, be deemed to have been given as if personally delivered (including personal delivery by facsimile, provided that the sender receives telephonic or electronic confirmation that the facsimile was received by the recipient), or three (3) days after mailing by certified or registered mad, return receipt requested, first class postage prepaid, addressed as shown on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (or at such other address as the addressed party may have substituted by notice pursuant to this Section 7(b)). 

   

   (c) _Successors and Assigns._ This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of Valley. Except for the Trust, this Agreement and the registration rights granted hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the legal representatives and heirs of each Shareholder if he becomes disabled or deceased, and may be assigned by each Shareholder to any immediate family member of the Shareholder (including any great grandchild or grandchild) or a trust or limited partnership established by the Shareholder, in any such case in connection with an assignment of Common Shares by the Shareholder to such family member, trust or limited partnership by gift or for estate planning purposes, but otherwise may not be assigned by the Shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no purported assignment by the Shareholders shall be valid unless the assignee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. 

   

   (d) _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   

   (e) _Headings and Interpretation._ The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. In construing the meaning of this Agreement, no party hereto shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed according to its fair meaning and not strictly against any person as the drafter hereof. 

   

   (f) _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New Jersey without giving effect to the conflicts of law provisions thereof. 

   

   (g) _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. This Agreement supersedes all prior oral and written agreements and understandings and all contemporaneous written agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. 

      (h) This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the  earlier of the sale of all of the Shares by the Shareholders or the expiration  of the restrictions on resale resulting from Rule 145 under the Securities Act. 

   

61

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Valley and the Trust have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized officers and the Shareholders have each executed this Agreement in their individual capacity, all as of the day and year first above written.
