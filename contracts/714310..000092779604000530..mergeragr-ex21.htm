          The election required by Section 2.1(a) and the exchange required by Section
          2.2(c) shall be made by the Shareholders by mailing to the Exchange Agent a Form
          of Election. A Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and submitted
          to the Exchange Agent by the Shareholder and accompanied by all the certificates
          representing the shares of NorCrown Common Stock as to which the election is
          being made. Valley will have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or
          in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been
          properly completed, signed and submitted and to disregard immaterial defects in
          Forms of Election. The good faith decision of Valley (or the Exchange Agent) in
          such matters shall be conclusive and binding, provided that Valley (and the
          Exchange Agent) does not act unreasonably. Neither Valley nor the Exchange Agent
          will be under any obligation to, but Valley and the Exchange Agent may (if they
          choose to do so), notify any person of any defect in a Form of Election
          submitted to the Exchange Agent. Valley and NorCrown shall each use its best
          efforts to mail the Form of Election to all persons who are holders of record of
          NorCrown Common Stock on the record date for the Shareholders&#146; Meeting (as
          hereinafter defined) at least the date fifteen calendar days prior to the
          anticipated Effective Time. A Form of Election must be received by the Exchange
          Agent by the close of business on the third business day prior to the Closing in
          order to be effective. All elections will be irrevocable. </FONT></P>

          Upon surrender of certificates of NorCrown Common Stock for exchange and
          cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
          duly executed, the Record Holder shall be entitled to promptly receive in
          exchange for such Certificates the consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)
          hereof and the certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. The Exchange Agent
          shall not be obligated to deliver or cause to be delivered to any Shareholder

          such Shareholder surrenders the certificates for exchange or, in default
          thereof, an appropriate Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement and/or a bond
          as may be reasonably required in each case by Valley. Notwithstanding the time

          Valley (if election to receive the Per Share Cash/Stock Consideration is made)
          for all purposes from the Effective Time, except that Valley shall withhold the
          payment of dividends from any Shareholder until such Shareholder effects the
          exchange of certificates for Valley Common Stock. (Such Shareholder shall
          receive such withheld dividends, without interest, upon effecting the share
          exchange.) </FONT></P>

          NorCrown has delivered to Valley in the <U>NorCrown Disclosure Schedule</U> a

          contract, if any; (iii) most recent IRS determination letter, if any; (iv) most

          The present value of all accrued benefits both vested and non-vested under each
          of the NorCrown Pension Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, based upon the
          actuarial assumptions used for purposes of the most recent actuarial valuation
          prepared by such NorCrown Pension Plan&#146;s actuary, did not exceed the then
          current value of the assets of such plans allocable to such accrued benefits. To
          NorCrown&#146;s knowledge, the actuarial assumptions then utilized for such
          plans were reasonable and appropriate as of the last valuation date and reflect
          then current market conditions. </FONT></P>

          During the last six years, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the
          &#147;<B>PBGC</B>&#148;) has not asserted any claim for liability against

          All premiums (and interest charges and penalties for late payment, if
          applicable) due to the PBGC with respect to each NorCrown Pension Plan have been
          paid. All contributions required to be made to each NorCrown Pension Plan under
          the terms thereof, ERISA or other applicable law have been timely made, and all
          amounts properly accrued to date as liabilities of NorCrown and its Subsidiaries
          which have not been paid have been properly recorded on the books of NorCrown
          and its Subsidiaries. </FONT></P>

          the Code, all regulations, rulings and announcements promulgated or issued
          thereunder, and all other applicable governmental laws and regulations.
          Furthermore, the IRS has issued a favorable determination letter, which takes
          into account the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and (to the extent it mandates currently
          applicable requirements) subsequent legislation, with respect to each of the
          NorCrown Pension Plans and NorCrown is not aware of any fact or circumstance
          which would disqualify any such plan, that could not be retroactively corrected
          (in accordance with the procedures of the IRS). </FONT></P>

          real property, title imperfections which are noted in the most recent title

          deductibles and against such risks and losses as are in the opinion of the
          management of Valley adequate for the business engaged in by Valley and its

accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management&#146;s general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability
for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management&#146;s

          During the Contract Period, NorCrown and the Trust shall permit Valley and its
          Representatives and Valley and VNB shall permit NorCrown and its Representatives
          (and for purposes of this Section 5.5 references to Representatives of NorCrown
          may include representatives of the Trust), reasonable access upon reasonable
          notice during regular business hours to their respective properties, and
          NorCrown and the Trust shall disclose and shall make available to Valley and its
          Representatives and Valley shall disclose and shall make available to NorCrown
          and its Representatives, all books, papers and records relating to their
          respective assets, stock ownership, properties, operations, obligations and
          liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of account (including the
          general ledger), tax records, minute books of directors&#146; and
          stockholders&#146; meetings, organizational documents, bylaws, material
          contracts and agreements, filings with any regulatory authority, independent
          auditors&#146; work papers (subject to the receipt by such auditors of a
          standard access representation letter), litigation files, plans affecting
          employees, and any other business activities or prospects in which Valley and
          its Representatives or NorCrown and its Representatives may have a reasonable
          interest. No party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
          information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
          rights of any customer or would contravene any law fiduciary duty, binding
          agreement, rule, regulation, regulatory policy, order or judgment or, in the
          case of a document which is subject to an attorney client privilege, would
          compromise the right of the disclosing party to claim that privilege. The
          parties will use all reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
          disclosure arrangements, to the fullest extent practicable, under circumstances
          in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. NorCrown acknowledges
          that Valley may be involved in discussions concerning other potential
          acquisitions and Valley shall not be obligated to disclose such information to
          NorCrown except as such information is publicly disclosed by Valley. </FONT></P>

          Notwithstanding that NorCrown believes that it has established all reserves and

          different loan, accrual and reserve policies (including loan classifications and
          levels of reserves for possible loan losses). During the Contract Period and in
          order to formulate the plan of integration for the Merger, NorCrown and VNB
          shall consult and cooperate with each other with respect to (i)&nbsp;conforming
          to the extent appropriate, based upon such consultation, NorCrown&#146;s loan,

          proceeding arising out of any such accrual or reserve, shall constitute or be

          representation letters required by Pitney Hardin LLP, dated on or about the date
          of such opinion, and such other facts and representations as counsel may
          reasonably deem relevant, to the effect that: (i) the Merger will be treated for
          federal income tax purposes as a &#147;reorganization&#148; qualifying under the
          provisions of Section 368 of the Code; (ii)&nbsp;no gain or loss will be
          recognized by the Shareholders upon the exchange of NorCrown Common Stock solely
          for Valley Common Stock; (iii) gain (but not loss), if any, realized by the
          Shareholders upon the exchange of NorCrown Common Stock will be recognized upon
          their receipt of the Per Share Cash Consideration but not in an amount in excess
          of the amount of the Per Share Cash Consideration received by such Shareholder;
          and (iv) in the case of the receipt by the Shareholders of cash in lieu of

          realized by the recipient on the exchange shall be recognized but in an amount
          not in excess of the amount of cash received. The tax opinions of Pitney Hardin
          LLP, summarized above are or will be based, among other things, on
          representations contained in certificates of the Trust and officers of NorCrown

exists or that there may be           legal defenses available to it or other indemnified
parties that are different           from or in addition to those available to the
indemnifying parties, then the           indemnified parties shall be entitled to counsel
(which shall be limited to a           single law firm for all indemnified parties) the
reasonable fees and expenses of           which shall be paid by the indemnifying
parties. If the indemnifying party does           not assume the defense of any such
action or proceeding, after having received           the notice referred to in the first
sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying           parties will pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel (which will be           limited to a single law firm for
all indemnified parties) for the indemnified           parties. In such event, however,
no indemnifying party will be liable for any           settlement effected without the
prior written consent of such indemnifying           party. If one or more of the
indemnifying parties assumes the defense of any           such action or proceeding in
accordance with this paragraph, such indemnifying           party shall not be liable for
any fees and expenses of counsel for the           indemnified parties incurred
thereafter in connection with such action or           proceeding except as set forth in
the proviso in the second sentence of this           Section&nbsp;5(c).  </FONT></P>

indemnifying party and each indemnified party in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such losses, claim, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well

parties and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
the total proceeds received by each indemnifying party and indemnified party in
connection with the offering to which such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses relate. The relative fault of each indemnifying party and indemnified party
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information
supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties&#146; relative
intent, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action.  </FONT></P>

     Immediately  prior to any  anticipated  sale of the Shares by a Shareholder
     subject to the Registration Statement,  the Shareholder shall notify Valley
     in writing of the anticipated sale of the Shares.  Each Shareholder  agrees
     that he will not effect any sales of Shares  pursuant  to the  Registration
     Statement  after the Shareholder has received notice from Valley to suspend
     sales as a result of the  occurrence or existence of any  Suspension  Event
     (as defined in section 6(b) below) until Valley provides  written notice to
     the  Shareholder  that all  Suspension  Events have  ceased to exist.  Each
     Shareholder  agrees that he will not effect any sales of Shares pursuant to
     the  Registration  Statement after the Shareholder has received notice from
     Valley to suspend sales because the Registration Statement,  any Prospectus
     or any supplement  thereto  contains an untrue statement of a material fact
     or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
     therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading,  until Valley notifies the Shareholder that the misstatement or
     omission has been  corrected.  Valley agrees that the period of time during
     which the Registration  Statement must be kept effective pursuant to clause
     (i) of Section  2(a) shall be extended  by a period  which is not less than
     the aggregate number of days during which any suspension under this Section
     6(a) or any Suspension Event is in effect. </FONT></P>

     Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  set  forth in this  Agreement,
     Valley&#146;s  obligation to file the  Registration  Statement and make any
     filings  with any state  securities  authority,  to use its best efforts to
     cause the Registration  Statement or any state securities filings to become
     effective  or  to  remain   effective,   or  to  amend  or  supplement  the
     Registration  Statement or any state securities  filings shall be suspended
     in the event of and during a  Suspension  Event.  A  &#147;<B><I>Suspension
     Event</I></B>&#148; shall exist at such times as circumstances exist
     that  Valley  determines  in good  faith,  on advice of  counsel,  that the
     filing,  amending or supplementing  of the  Registration  Statement or such
     filings or the causing of the  Registration  Statement  or such  filings to
     become  effective or to remain effective or for the sale of Shares to occur
     under the Registration  Statement shall require disclosure under applicable
     securities laws of material  information in the Registration  Statement (or
     any  other  document  incorporated  into  the  Registration   Statement  by
     reference) or such state  securities  filings as to which Valley has a bona
     fide  business  purpose for  preserving  confidentiality  or which  renders
     Valley  unable to comply with SEC  requirements.  Valley  shall  notify the
     Shareholders promptly after any Suspension Event occurs or ceases to exist.
     Suspension of Valley&#146;s obligations pursuant to this Section 6(b) shall
     continue  for so long as a  Suspension  Event or its effect is  continuing.
