          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 21, 2003 (this
"Agreement"), among LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), RUBY ACQUISITION COMPANY, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and NEUBERGER BERMAN INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              - - - - - - - - - -

          WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have each approved and declared advisable the merger of the Company
with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, pursuant to which each outstanding share
of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than shares owned or held directly by the Company ("Treasury Shares") and other
than Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive a unit
consisting of a fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $.10 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") and an amount
in cash;

          WHEREAS, as a condition to Parent entering into this Agreement and
incurring the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Parent is entering into a Voting Agreement with
certain significant stockholders in the Company (the "Voting Agreement")
pursuant to which, among other things, each of those stockholders have agreed,
subject to the terms thereof, to vote all shares of Company Common Stock owned
by each of them in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement;

          WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

          WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company intend that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder ("Treasury
Regulations"), and, by approving resolutions authorizing this Agreement, to
adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

<PAGE>

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

   1.1    The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"), the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub at the Effective
Time. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company
shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation") under the name "Neuberger Berman Inc." In lieu of the
Company being merged with and into Merger Sub, Parent shall have the right to
revocably elect (the "Reverse Merger Election") by notice delivered to the
Company, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (including without limitation, the conditions set forth in Sections
6.2(c) and 6.3(c)), to cause the "Merger" to be a merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company at the Effective Time, in which case, following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the Surviving Corporation.

   1.2    Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to
the provisions of Section 7.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or,
where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the Closing) set forth in
Article VI, unless the Company shall have delivered notice pursuant to Section
1.10(c) electing to delay the Closing in accordance with the terms of Section
1.10(c) (in which case the Closing shall occur on the date specified in such
notice), and unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (the date of the Closing, the "Closing Date"); provided that, in the
event that the Company has delivered the Termination Notice pursuant to Section
7.1(h), the "Closing Date" shall be the third Business Day following delivery of
the Top-Up Notice pursuant to Section 7.1(h), if any. The Closing shall be held
at the offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10017, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.

   1.3    Effective Time. Upon the Closing, the parties shall (i) file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and (ii) make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective
at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

   1.4    Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall be
vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

                                        2

<PAGE>

   1.5    Certificate of Incorporation. Unless the Reverse Merger Election is
made, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable law, except that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in its entirety as
follows: "The name of this Corporation is `Neuberger Berman Inc.'" If the
Reverse Merger Election is made, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
shall be amended at the Effective Time so as to read in its entirety as set
forth in Exhibit 1.5 and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable law.

   1.6    By-Laws. Unless the Reverse Merger Election is made, the By-Laws of
Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
by applicable law. If the Reverse Merger Election is made, the By-Laws of the
Company as amended in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit 1.6 shall be the
By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable law.

   1.7    Officers and Directors of Surviving Corporation. The officers of the
Company as of the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise
ceasing to be an officer or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The directors of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall submit their resignations to be effective as
of the Effective Time. The directors of Merger Sub as of the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

   1.8    Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:

    (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive (x) $9.49 in cash, subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 7.1(h), if applicable, and reduction pursuant to
Section 1.10, if applicable (the "Per-Share Cash Consideration"), and (y) a
fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"), subject to
Section 2.5 with respect to fractional shares. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Exchange Ratio" means, subject to reduction pursuant to Section 1.10, if
applicable, (i) 0.411, if the Parent Reference Price is greater than $90.41;
(ii) if the Parent Reference Price is greater than $82.19 but less than or equal
to $90.41, that fraction, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, or if there
shall not be a nearest ten-thousandth, to the next lower ten-thousandth, equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing $37.15 by the Parent Reference Price; (iii)
0.452, if the Parent Reference Price is greater than $73.00 and less than or
equal to $82.19; (iv) if the Parent Reference Price is greater than $66.51 and
less than or equal to $73.00, that fraction, rounded to the nearest
ten-thousandth, or if there shall not be nearest ten-thousandth, to the next
higher ten-thousandth, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $33.01 by the
Parent Reference Price; (v) 0.496, if the Parent Reference Price is less than or
equal to $66.51; and (vi) if Parent shall have given the Top-Up Notice

                                        3

<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 7.1(h), the Exchange Ratio as set forth in such notice and
determined by Parent in accordance with Section 7.1(h). "Parent Reference Price"
means the average of the volume weighted sales prices per share of Parent Common
Stock as reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system for
securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") (as reported in
Bloomberg Financial Markets or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative
source as the parties shall agree in writing) for the 10 consecutive full
trading dates (the "Reference Period") ending on the second trading day prior to
the Closing Date (or, in the event that (x) the Company elects to delay Closing
pursuant to Section 1.10(c) or (y) the Termination Notice is delivered by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then in each case the second trading day
prior to the date that would have been the Closing Date as determined pursuant
to Section 1.2 hereof without application of delay pursuant to Section 1.10(c)
or the proviso contained in the first sentence of such Section 1.2, as
applicable), appropriately adjusted for any stock splits, reverse stock splits,
stock dividends, recapitalizations or other similar transactions. The Parent
Reference Price shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent.

    (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock
(other than shares referred to in Sections 1.8(c) and (e)) shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become
entitled all in accordance with Article II upon the surrender of such
Certificate.

    (c) Each Treasury Share at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and no Merger
Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

    (d) Unless the Reverse Merger Election shall have been made, each share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain issued, outstanding and
unchanged as a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. If the Reverse
Merger Election is made, each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

    (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that are entitled to demand
and have properly demanded rights of appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholders shall have
failed to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal
under applicable law, but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to
payment of the appraised

                                        4

<PAGE>

value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If
any such holder shall fail to perfect or shall effectively withdraw or lose such
right of appraisal, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder
shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares for purposes of this Agreement and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.8(a), without interest. The Company
shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal filed pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL received by Company, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served or delivered in connection with such demands
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (B) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands made
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any payment with respect to any such
demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any such demand or (z) waive any failure
to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action
to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

    (f) If prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, should (after obtaining the consent required by Section 4.1 or 4.2, as the
case may be, hereof) split, combine or otherwise reclassify the Parent Common
Stock or the Company Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend or other stock
distribution in Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as applicable, or
otherwise change the Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock into any other
securities, or make any other such stock dividend or distribution in capital
stock of Parent or the Company in respect of the Parent Common Stock or the
Company Common Stock, respectively, then any number or amount contained herein
which is based upon the price of the Parent Common Stock or the number of shares
of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend,
reclassification or other distribution or change.

    1.9   Treatment of Options and Other Stock Awards. (a) As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to adjust the terms of all outstanding employee or director stock
options to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Options") granted under any
Company Stock Plan, to provide that at the Effective Time, each Company Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested in full
pursuant to the terms of such Company Option and shall be converted into an
option to acquire such number of shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Converted
Option") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by (y) the Special Option
Exchange Ratio (provided that any fractional share resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share). The terms and
conditions of the Converted Option shall otherwise remain the same as the terms
and conditions of the Company Option, except that the exercise price per share
of each Converted Option shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the exercise
price per share of such Company Option divided by (ii) the Special Option
Exchange Ratio (provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole cent); provided, however, that, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to amend each Company Option that by its terms contains an "option
reload" feature ("Reload Options") to: (A) suspend, effective as of the date of
this Agreement, any holder of a Reload Option's rights to exercise such option
and receive a "reload" of options (within the meaning of the applicable

                                        5

<PAGE>

Company Stock Plan); and, further, (B) effective as of the Effective Time,
cancel such "option reload" feature such that the Converted Options resulting
from the conversion of such Reload Options will not contain an "option reload"
feature. For purposes of this Section 1.9, the term "Special Option Exchange
Ratio" shall mean the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio plus (ii) the quotient of
(x) the Per-Share Cash Consideration divided by (y) the Parent Reference Price.

    (b) All shares of restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company
Stock Plans (and any other shares of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or
future issuance under the Company Stock Plans) (collectively, "Other Stock
Awards") held by a current employee or director of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated in the same manner as all other shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.8 of
this Agreement; provided, however, that the Merger Consideration received by
each holder in exchange for the holder's Other Stock Awards pursuant to Section
1.8 of this Agreement shall be subject to the terms and conditions (including
vesting schedules) applicable to such Other Stock Awards under the terms of the
Company Stock Plans and any related award agreements as in effect prior to the
Closing Date; provided, further, however, that the Per-Share Cash Consideration
portion of such Merger Consideration shall be entered into a notional account on
the books and records of Parent or the Company (with interest accruing annually
on such amounts at the rate applicable to one-year Treasury Bills, as reported
by the U.S. Federal Reserve on the Closing Date and each anniversary thereof),
subject to distribution upon vesting. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that none of the vesting schedules of the Other Stock
Awards shall be accelerated in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

    (c) With respect to the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"),
the Company (i) shall take all actions necessary to cause the current Offering
Period (within the meaning of the ESPP), if any, to terminate as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (and, in the event of such
termination, the Company shall cause all amounts deducted from participants'
compensation during such Offering Period to be promptly returned to each such
participant), and (ii) shall refrain from commencing any new Offering Periods
under the ESPP thereafter.

    (d) With respect to the Company's Employee Defined Contribution Stock
Incentive Plan (the "DCSIP"), in the event that the Closing Date is or is
reasonably expected to occur prior to October 8, 2003, the Company shall, if so
requested by Parent in its sole discretion after reasonable advance notice of
such request, cause the vesting as of immediately prior to the Closing Date of
the Company Common Stock held in trust under the DCSIP that is otherwise
scheduled to vest and be distributed on October 8, 2003 in accordance with the
terms of the DCSIP.

    (e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on
Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), or another appropriate form, with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to the Converted Options and Other Stock Awards.

                                        6

<PAGE>

    (f) The Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.9 and any other
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in
connection with this Agreement by each individual who (i) is a director or
officer of the Company or (ii) at the Effective Time will become a director or
officer of Parent to become exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

    1.10  Adjustment to Merger Consideration. (a) In the event that the
Aggregate Closing PAM Revenue Run-Rate is less than 85.0% of the Aggregate Base
PAM Revenue Run-Rate, then (i) the Per-Share Cash Consideration shall be reduced
by an amount equal to the product of (A) the unadjusted Per-Share Cash
Consideration as determined pursuant to Section 1.8(a) hereof multiplied by (B)
the Shortfall Ratio, and (ii) the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the product of (A) the unadjusted Exchange Ratio as determined pursuant
to Section 1.8(a) multiplied by (B) the Shortfall Ratio.

    (b) As used in this Agreement:

          (i)   The "Shortfall Ratio" shall be equal to the product of (A) 1.25
multiplied by (B) the excess of (i) 85.0% over (ii) a fraction (expressed as a
percentage) the numerator of which is the Aggregate Closing PAM Revenue Run-Rate
and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Base PAM Revenue Run-Rate,
provided that the Shortfall Ratio shall not exceed 6.25%.

          (ii)  "Aggregate Base PAM Revenue Run-Rate" shall mean the sum of the
Base PAM Revenue Run-Rates for all PAM Advisory Contracts. The Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the Aggregate Base PAM
Revenue Run-Rate is the dollar amount set forth in Annex 1.10(b) of that certain
Supplemental Matters Letter of even date herewith delivered by the Company to
Parent (the "Supplemental Matters Letter").

          (iii) "Aggregate Closing PAM Revenue Run-Rate" shall mean the sum of
the Closing PAM Revenue Run-Rates for all Consenting PAM Advisory Contracts.

          (iv)  "Base Asset-Based Fee Rate" shall mean, with respect to a PAM
Advisory Contract, the asset-based investment advisory and subadvisory annual
fee rate (excluding any performance-based fees) payable to the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to such PAM Advisory Contract as of the Base Date, after
taking into account any fee waivers, reimbursement obligations or similar
offsets or other arrangements.

          (v)   "Base Date" shall mean May 31, 2003.

          (vi)  "Base PAM Assets Under Management" shall mean, with respect to a
PAM Advisory Contract, the amount of assets under management by the Company and
its Subsidiaries pursuant to such PAM Advisory Contract as of the Base Date.

          (vii) "Base PAM Revenue Run-Rate" shall mean, with respect to a PAM
Advisory Contract, the product of (A) the Base PAM Assets Under Management
pursuant to such PAM Advisory Contract, multiplied by (B) the Base Asset-Based
Fee Rate under such PAM Advisory Contract.

                                        7

<PAGE>

          (viii) "Closing Asset-Based Fee Rate" shall mean, with respect to a
Consenting PAM Advisory Contract, the asset-based investment advisory and
subadvisory annual fee rate (excluding any performance-based fees) payable to
the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to such Consenting PAM Advisory
Contract as of the most recent calendar month end prior to the Closing Date
after taking into account any fee waivers, reimbursement obligations or similar
offsets or other arrangements, provided that any increase in the applicable fee
rate payable under a Consenting PAM Advisory Contract following the Base Date
(whether by reason of a change in the targeted allocation of the client's
investment portfolio or otherwise) shall be taken into account only if such rate
increase has been affirmatively agreed to by the PAM Advisory Client who is
party to such contract.

          (ix)   "Closing Adjusted PAM Assets Under Management" shall mean, with
respect to a Consenting PAM Advisory Contract, the amount of assets under
management by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to such Consenting PAM
Advisory Contract as of the Base Date (or, in the case of a Consenting PAM
Advisory Contract entered into with a new client following the Base Date, as of
the date of such Consenting PAM Advisory Contract), as adjusted to reflect net
cash flows (additions, withdrawals and reinvestments of dividends and interest),
from and after the Base Date (or, in the case of a Consenting PAM Advisory
Contract entered into with a new client following the Base Date, the date of
such Consenting PAM Advisory Contract) through and including the date that is
the most recent calendar month end prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance
of doubt, the calculation of Closing Adjusted PAM Assets Under Management
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence excludes any increase or decrease
in assets under management resulting from market appreciation or depreciation or
currency fluctuations from and after the Base Date (or such later date of such
Consenting PAM Advisory Contract, in the case of a Consenting PAM Advisory
Contract entered into with a new client following the Base Date).

          (x)    "Closing PAM Revenue Run-Rate" shall mean, with respect to a
Consenting PAM Advisory Contract, the product of (A) the Closing Adjusted PAM
Assets Under Management pursuant to such Consenting PAM Advisory Contract,
multiplied by (B) the Closing Asset-Based Fee Rate under such Consenting PAM
Advisory Contract (or, with respect to the contract of any Consenting PAM
Advisory Client that has informed the Company or any Subsidiary thereof that it
will reduce the fee rate payable by such PAM Advisory Client to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and/or reduce the Closing Adjusted PAM Assets Under Management

                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

    2.1   Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with The Bank of New York or such other bank or trust company as Parent shall
determine and who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent"), in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
for exchange in accordance with Section 1.8, all the cash and certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid or issued pursuant to this
Agreement in exchange for outstanding Company Common Stock and cash sufficient
to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5. Parent agrees
to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3.
Any cash and certificates of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

    2.2   Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent will send to each record holder of a Certificate other
than Certificates to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.8(c) and Certificates in
respect of Dissenting Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate, upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate or certificates representing the number of full shares of
Parent Common Stock and the amount of cash (including amounts to be paid
pursuant to Section 1.8(a), in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to

                                        9

<PAGE>

Section 2.5 and in respect of any dividends or other distributions to which
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3), if any, into which the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8 (except to the extent
provided in Section 1.9(b)), Section 2.3 or Section 2.5. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, one or more shares of Parent Common Stock
evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3, shall be issued with respect to such Company Common
Stock to such a transferee only if the Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

    2.3   Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.5 until such holder shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2. Subject to the
effect, if any, of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

    2.4   No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.8(a), 2.3 or 2.5) shall be deemed
to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock.

    2.5   No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. (a) No certificates or
scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock.

     (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the Parent Reference Price. As promptly as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional
interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

     2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on
the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of Certificates
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) for the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5 and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates five
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

     2.7 No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     2.8 Investment of the Exchange Fund. Any funds included in the Exchange
Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent; provided that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid
to Parent.

     2.9 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate or other
documentation (including an indemnity in customary form) reasonably requested by
Parent, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in

                                       11

<PAGE>

lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

    2.10 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock and
any holder of Other Stock Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock or the holder of Other Stock Awards, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be.

    2.11 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger.

    2.12 Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business, New York time, on the
day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by law. On or after the
Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for
any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.

                                   ARTICLE V

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     5.1  Preparation of Proxy Statement and Registration Statement; Company
Stockholders Meeting. (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC,
and Parent shall prepare and file the Registration Statement (in which the Proxy
Statement will be included) with the SEC. Parent and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective
under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as practicable and to keep
the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. The Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company in favor of adoption of this Agreement and the Merger,
except to the extent the Board of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn
or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement as permitted by
Section 5.4(b). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement becomes effective; provided, however, that,
unless Parent shall otherwise request in writing, the Proxy Statement shall not
be mailed to the Company's stockholders prior to the satisfaction of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 6.2(e) and 6.2(f) hereof. The
parties shall promptly provide copies, consult with each other and prepare
written responses with respect to any written comments received from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and advise
one another of any oral comments received from the SEC. The Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement shall

                                       43

<PAGE>

comply as to form in all material respects with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
respectively.

     (b)  Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect
to the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and applicable Blue Sky Laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Each party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement shall be filed without the approval of both parties
hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company.

     (c)  The Company shall cause the Founders Pre-Meeting to be duly called and
held immediately prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purposes of
obtaining the Required Company Vote. The Company shall cause the Company
Stockholders Meeting to be duly called as soon as reasonably practicable, and
held as soon as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement in accordance with Section 5.1, in each case for the purpose of
obtaining the Required Company Vote. In connection with such meeting, the
Company will (i) subject to Section 5.4(b), use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Required Company Vote and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to such meeting. Unless this Agreement is previously
terminated in accordance with Article VII, the Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders at the Founders Pre-Meeting and the Company
Stockholders Meeting even if the Company Board of Directors determines at any
time after the date hereof that is no longer advisable or recommends that the
Company stockholders reject it.

     5.2  Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its officers, employees, properties and offices and to
all books and records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent and its Representatives,
consistent with its legal obligations, all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided,
however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that,
in the Company's reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have

                                       44

<PAGE>

used all reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
access, (ii) any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority
applicable to the Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict
access to any properties or information or (iii) providing such access would
result in the Company waiving or otherwise losing any privilege with respect to
any such information or if such information constitutes attorney work product.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and its
Representatives in all reasonable respects (including without limitation by
providing reasonable access to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' records,
personnel, Clients and other customers) in connection with, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to assist Parent and its Representatives or, at Parent's
option, an independent third party consultant in their efforts following the
date of this Agreement to, verify all of the information regarding Clients and
other customers described in Section 3.l(aa)(vi) of this Agreement (and the
other statements set forth in such section), including without limitation if
requested by Parent by requesting confirmation of such information and
statements from Clients and other customers, provided that the Company shall
have the right to participate jointly in any communications by Parent or its
Representatives with Clients except to the extent it may otherwise agree in
writing.

          In addition and without limiting the foregoing, (a) the Company shall
promptly advise Parent of any Client-related or other operational (e.g., trade
settlement) matters involving material risks to the Company and its Subsidiaries
as an economic, liability or public relations matter (e.g., any such matters
discussed at the Company's risk management meetings), and shall provide Parent
such other risk management information as Parent may reasonably request, (b) the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any negative change of more than 15%
from the levels set forth in the Company's balance sheet as of March 31, 2003 in
excess capital, (c) the Company shall promptly notify Parent if it becomes aware
of any material changes in the credit quality or other financial status of
Clients that would reasonably be expected to present material economic,
liability or public relations risks to the Company, or in the event of any
material disputes with Clients involving material fees or other payments to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, and (d) the Company shall promptly provide to
Parent, as and when available, copies of (i) monthly financial statements for
the Company and its Subsidiaries, including balance sheet and income statement,
(ii) the Company's Management Information Systems reports with respect to
operations and middle office and (iii) subject to the proviso in the first
sentence of the preceding paragraph, all monthly FOCUS reports received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company further acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the Closing Date, Parent's risk management team will complete a
review of all margin lending activities conducted by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and the Company agrees to reasonably cooperate in such efforts.

          Parent shall hold any such information that is non-public in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of
the letter dated April 22, 2003, as amended, between the Company and Parent and
the letter dated July 7, 2003 between Parent and the Company (collectively, the
"Confidentiality Agreements"). Any investigation by the Company or Parent shall
not affect the representations and warranties or the conditions to the
obligations of the Company or Parent, as the case may be.

     (b)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party to this
Agreement (and any employee, representative, or other agent of any party to this
Agreement) may disclose to any

                                       45

<PAGE>

and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Transactions") and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure; provided, however, that neither party (nor any employee,
representative or other agent thereof) shall disclose any information (a) that
is not relevant to an understanding of the U.S. federal income tax treatment or
tax structure of the Transactions, including the identity of any party to this
Agreement (or its employees, representatives, or other agents) or other
information that could lead any person to determine such identity, (b) to the
extent such disclosure could result in a violation of any federal or state
securities laws or (c) until the earliest of (i) the date of the public
announcement of discussions relating to the Transactions, (ii) the date of the
public announcement of the Transactions and (iii) the date of the execution of
an agreement to enter into the Transactions.

     5.3  Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable
after the date hereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
HSR Act as soon as practicable. In addition and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain (i) all consents, approvals or Permits of the NYSE, Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), Delaware state banking authority
and all other SROs and Governmental Authorities required for the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to conduct the broker-dealer, commodities,
trust, insurance and other regulated businesses after the Closing Date as are
conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (and not
violate any applicable laws or regulations by reason of the consummation of the
Merger), including without limitation each of the consents, approvals and
Permits identified in Section 3.1(f)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and
(ii) any amendments, modifications or affirmations of exemptive orders and
no-action positions of the SEC as are necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations or otherwise reasonably requested by Parent to
allow the Company and its Subsidiaries to operate their respective business
following the Merger substantially in the same manner as operated on the date
hereof (including in respect of arrangements between the Company or its
Subsidiaries and Parent or its Affiliates).

     (b)  Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 5.3(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including
any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly inform the other
party of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other

                                       46

<PAGE>

Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review
any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other
laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Section 5.3(a) and
this Section 5.3(b), each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Regulatory Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
connection with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by
either Parent or the Company to consummate the Merger, in no event shall Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to
accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make
any divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or take or commit to take
any action that, in the sole discretion of Parent, would be expected to limit
(A) the freedom of action of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with
respect to the operation of, or Parent's or its Subsidiaries' or Affiliates'
ability to retain, the Company or any businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company, or (B) the ability to retain, own or operate any material portion of
the businesses, product lines, or assets, of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the business or commercial
practices of the Company, Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

     (c) (i) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to obtain
consents of all third parties necessary, proper or advisable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
without limitation to enter into employment agreements in the applicable form
included for such person in Section 6.2(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
with the employees listed in Section 6.2(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
and to obtain the agreements necessary to satisfy the condition to Closing set
forth in Section 6.2(f) hereof); provided that the Company shall not be required
to make any unreasonable payment, provide any unreasonable financial
accommodation or agree to any unreasonable modification to any contractual
arrangement to obtain such consents or certificates; and provided, further,
that, without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary thereof shall make, or commit to make, any direct or indirect payment
(including without limitation increases in compensation or grants of options or
equity) to any Person to enter into employment agreements in the applicable form
included for such person in Section 6.2(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or
to obtain the agreements necessary to satisfy the condition to Closing set forth
in Section 6.2(f) hereof (other than the allocations from the Retention Bonus
Pool expressly provided for in Section 5.5(c) of this Agreement); (B) obtain an
estoppel certificate from the lessor of the Company's headquarters building at
605 Third Avenue, New York City in the form contemplated by Section 35 of the
applicable lease; and (C) to

                                       47

<PAGE>

provide any notices to third parties required to be provided prior to the
Effective Time, including under any Leases or insurance policies.

     (ii) Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to each Investment
Contract for which the consent of a Client to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Investment Contract as a result of the Merger is required by
applicable law and/or by the terms of such Investment Contract (other than
Clients that are Investment Companies), as promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
send a written notice (a "Notice") informing such Clients of the Merger and
requesting written consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of such
Client's Investment Contract. In the case of any Client (other than an
Investment Company) that is a trust (or similar estate planning vehicle), a
Notice requesting written consent also shall be sent to each of the
beneficiaries of such trust, and/or approval shall be sought from any applicable
court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the selection of
fiduciaries for such trust (or other estate planning vehicle), in each case with
respect to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Client's Investment
Contract resulting from the Merger to the extent such consent of beneficiaries
and/or approval of a Governmental Authority is required by the constituent
documents of such trust (or other estate planning vehicle), its Investment
Contract or applicable law. All Notices and related materials distributed to
Clients shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, and
Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review all such Notices
prior to distribution and to have its reasonable comments reflected therein,
provided that, in the case of any trust or other estate planning vehicle for
which neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective employees) serves as a trustee (or in a similar fiduciary capacity
for such other estate planning vehicle, as applicable), the authority purported
to be held by the trustee(s) of such trust (or equivalent fiduciary of such
other estate planning vehicle, as applicable) for purposes of providing such
consent under its constituent documents and applicable law shall be conclusive
(with respect to both notification and consent requirements) absent actual
knowledge of the Company to the contrary. The Company shall make available to
Parent copies of all substantive correspondence between it or any of its
Subsidiaries and Clients (or their representatives or counsel) relating to the
consent solicitation provided for in this Section 5.3(c)(ii).

     For each Client that is registered as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act (a "Registered Investment Company"), the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain in accordance with Section 15 of the
Investment Company Act, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof,
the due consideration and approval by the board of directors of the Registered
Investment Company ("Fund Board Approval") of a new Advisory Contract with the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary (and a replacement of any other existing
agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and such Registered
Investment Company, to the extent any other such existing agreement will
terminate as a result of the Merger) (in each case to be in effect as of, and
subject to, the Closing) on terms substantially identical (and identical with
respect to fee rates) to the terms of the Company's or its applicable
Subsidiary's existing Advisory Contract (or such other applicable agreement, as
applicable) with such Registered Investment Company. To the extent Fund Board
Approval has been obtained with respect to a new Advisory Contract in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain in accordance with Section 15 of the Investment Company
Act, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the due

                                       48

<PAGE>

consideration and approval ("Fund Shareholder Approval") by the shareholders of
such Registered Investment Company (except, in the case of any Registered
Investment Company other than a Proprietary Fund, to the extent such shareholder
approval is not required by law for the effectiveness of such new advisory
agreement) of such new Advisory Contract described in the immediately preceding
sentence. All proxy and related materials distributed in connection with the
approvals described in this paragraph shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, and Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
review all such proxies and other materials prior to distribution and to have
its reasonable comments reflected therein.

     For each Client that is an Investment Company but not a Registered
Investment Company, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
in accordance with the constituent documents of such Investment Company and
applicable law, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the
consent and approval (as applicable) of any governing body of such Investment
Company and of its investors required by such constituent documents and
applicable law of either (a) the continuation of each Advisory Contract and
other Investment Contract between the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and such
Investment Company to the assignment or deemed assignment of such Investment
Contract as a result of the Merger (to the extent any such agreement may
continue in effect following the Merger with such consent) or (b) a new Advisory
Contract and a replacement of any other existing agreement between the Company
or any Subsidiary thereof and such Investment Company, to the extent the
existing advisory agreement and/or any other such existing agreement will
terminate as a result of the Merger) (in each case to be in effect as of, and
subject to, the Closing) on terms substantially identical (and identical with
respect to fee rates) to the terms of the Company's or its applicable
Subsidiary's existing Advisory Contract and other applicable agreement with such
Investment Company. The manner of consent and approval solicited with respect to
each such Investment Company that is not a Registered Investment Company shall
be reasonably acceptable to Parent, and all solicitation and related materials
distributed in connection with the consents and approvals described in this
paragraph shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and
Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review all such
solicitation and related materials prior to distribution and to have its
reasonable comments reflected therein.

     With respect to each of the foregoing Clients where the relationship
between the Company or its applicable Subsidiary and the ultimate underlying
Client is through a financial intermediary (e.g., an insurance company that has
retained the Company or a Subsidiary thereof to manage variable annuity and/or
variable life products, a "wrap" sponsor that has made the Company or a
Subsidiary thereof available to the sponsor's underlying clients to provide
advisory services, a "private label" distribution counterparty that has retained
the Company or a Subsidiary thereof to manage a product distributed by such
counterparty to third parties, etc.) (each, a "Financial Intermediary"), the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to, send a
separate written notice to each Financial Intermediary informing such Financial
Intermediary of the Merger and (A) requesting written consent to the assignment
or deemed assignment of such Financial Intermediary's master agreement (the
"Master Agreement") with the Company or its applicable Subsidiary resulting from
the Merger (where such Master Agreement may by its terms and under applicable
law remain in effect following consummation of the Merger with such consent of
the Financial Intermediary), or (B) requesting such Financial Intermediary to
enter into a new Master Agreement with the Company or its

                                       49

<PAGE>

applicable Subsidiary (where the existing Master Agreement will terminate as a
result of the Merger by its terms or under applicable law) to be in effect as
of, and subject to, the Closing on terms substantially identical (and identical
with respect to fee rates) to the terms of the Company's or its applicable
Subsidiary's existing Master Agreement with such Financial Intermediary. All
notices and related materials distributed to Financial Intermediaries shall be
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, and Parent shall be
provided a reasonable opportunity to review all such notices prior to
distribution and to have its reasonable comments reflected therein. The Company
shall make available to Parent copies of all substantive correspondence between
it or any of its Subsidiaries and Financial Intermediaries (or their
representatives or counsel) relating to the consent solicitation provided for in
this Section 5.3(c)(ii).

          With respect to all other Clients not addressed by the foregoing
paragraphs of this Section 5.3(c)(ii), as promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
deliver written notices to such Clients informing them of the transactions
contemplated hereby that are substantially identical to the Notice; provided
that consent of such Clients shall not be sought by such written notices unless
required by applicable law and/or the terms of the applicable Investment
Contracts to which such Clients are parties.

     (d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall not knowingly take or fail to
take any action which action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to
jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Unless required by law, each of Parent,
Merger Sub, and the Company shall not file any Tax Return or take any position
inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization described in
Section 368(a) of the Code.

     (e) Each of the parties shall execute any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties agree to use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur as soon as practicable after the
Company stockholder vote with respect to the Merger. If at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party hereto shall take all
such necessary action.

     (f) To the extent determined in good faith by Parent to be required by
applicable law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
their reasonable best efforts to (i) as of the Effective Time, cease to manage,
or otherwise to be deemed a "fiduciary" (within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA) with respect to, any and all assets of Clients that are (x) subject to
ERISA and (y) invested, as of the date hereof, in equity and/or debt securities
of Parent or its ERISA Affiliates, and (ii) not later than such time as is
determined in good faith by Parent to be required under applicable law, cause
all other accounts of Clients that hold equity and/or debt securities of Parent
or any of its Affiliates to dispose of such securities (including without
limitation Clients that are Registered Investment Companies).

     5.4  Acquisition Proposals. (a) Neither the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, advisors,

                                       50

<PAGE>

representatives, agents or other intermediaries), nor shall the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives, agents or other
intermediaries to, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly
facilitate or encourage the submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from
any Person (as defined below) (other than Parent) relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into any
agreement to (w) facilitate or further the consummation of, or consummate, any
Acquisition Proposal, (x) facilitate the making of any inquiry with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, (y) approve or endorse any Acquisition Proposal or (z)
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, require it to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger; (iii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry with respect to a Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to its business, properties or assets in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to a Acquisition Proposal;
or (iv) agree to resolve or take any of the actions prohibited by clause (i),
(ii) or (iii) of this sentence. The Company shall immediately cease, and cause
its advisors, agents and other intermediaries to immediately cease, any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and shall demand the return or
destruction of any information previously provided with respect to such
activities, discussion, or negotiations. For purposes of this Section 5.4, the
term "Person" means any person, corporation, entity or "group," as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than Parent or any Subsidiaries of
Parent.

          "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal for a merger,
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire, directly or indirectly,
securities representing more than 20% of the voting power of the Company or more
than 20% of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
other than the Merger contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company,
directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may (i)
comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to any Acquisition Proposal, so long as any such compliance rejects any
Acquisition Proposal and reaffirms its recommendation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent such action is otherwise
permitted by this Section 5.4(b), (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions
with any Person that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal not resulting from or arising out of a breach of Section 5.4(a), (iii)
furnish to such Person nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the applicable Confidentiality
Agreement and/or (iv) if prior to the Company obtaining the Required Company
Vote, withdraw or modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger; provided that the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be permitted to take an action described in the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) if, and only if, prior to taking such
particular action, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith by a majority vote that (x) such Acquisition Proposal would result in, or
would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, in the case of
any of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), or constitutes a Superior
Proposal, in the case of the foregoing clause (iv), and (y) that, after

                                       51

<PAGE>

considering the advice of outside legal counsel, it is required to take such
particular action to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

          "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with an
independent nationally recognized financial advisor, taking into account all the
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) are more
favorable to the Company's stockholders, from a financial point of view, than
this Agreement and the Merger, taken as a whole, and that is reasonably capable
of being completed (including with respect to the need for and ability of such
third party to obtain any external financing and all legal and regulatory
issues). Reference to "this Agreement" and "the Merger" in this paragraph shall
be deemed to include any proposed alteration of the terms of this Agreement or
the Merger that are agreed to by Parent after it receives written notice from
the Company pursuant to Section 5.4(d) of the existence of, the identity of the
Person making, and the terms and conditions of, any Acquisition Proposal.

any time prior to the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders by the Required Company Vote, the Company's Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that was
unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of Section 5.4(a),
that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company or its Board of Directors
may terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this sentence, and any purported
termination pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no -force or effect,
unless the Company prior to or concurrently with such termination pursuant to
this Section 5.4(c) pays to Parent the fee payable pursuant to Section 7.2(b)
and enters into a definitive agreement concerning the Superior Proposal; and
provided, further, however, that the Company shall not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.4(c) until after five (5)
Business Days following Parent's receipt of written notice (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the amount or form of consideration of the
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new five (5) Business Day
period) advising Parent that the Company's Board of Directors intends to cause
the Company to accept such Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal and that the Company shall, during such five
(5) Business Day period, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

     (d)  The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 24
hours) after receipt or occurrence of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any
inquiry, proposal, discussions or negotiation with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and (iv) the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition

Person (or from any representatives or agents of such Person) making such
Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry or proposal or with whom
such discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company shall keep Parent
fully informed of the status and material details (including any amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or request for information
and keep Parent fully informed as to the material details of any information
requested of or provided by the Company and as to the material details of all
discussions or negotiations with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal,
request for information, inquiry or proposal and shall provide to Parent within
one Business Day after receipt thereof all copies of any additional Other
Acquisition Documentation received by the Company from the Person (or from any
representatives or agents of such Person) making such Acquisition Proposal,
request for information, inquiry or proposal or with whom such discussions or
negotiations are taking place. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any
non-public information concerning the Company provided to any other Person in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to

deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time in such year;
and (iii) provide each Company Employee with credit for service with the Company
and its affiliates (A) for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting
under any defined benefit pension plans and (B) for all purposes under each
other employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement of the Parent or its

Company Employees and the individual allocation amounts to each such person not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by either the Company or Parent);
provided that the selection of key Company Employees and determinations of
allocation amounts pursuant to this clause (iii) shall be completed as promptly
as practicable following the date of this Agreement; and provided, further,
that, as a condition precedent to being granted his or her allocation from the
Retention Bonus Pool, each participant in the Retention Bonus Pool selected

incorporation and by-laws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof,
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") (but only
to the extent such Costs are not otherwise covered by insurance and paid)
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including without limitation, the transactions contemplated by

advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent Parent or the Surviving
Corporation would have been required to do so under the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof,
provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is finally determined by a court of competent

further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. The provisions
of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained by the Surviving Corporation for purposes of
this Section 5.7, which policies (together with the Company's existing policy)
provide such directors and officers with the coverage described in the
immediately preceding sentence for an aggregate period of not less than six
years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising

to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7. The parties

agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by
law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities
exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time

any Proprietary Fund's prospectus and other offering, advertising or marketing
materials.

Section 5.6, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII, provided that the termination of
this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for any
intentional breach of any covenant or agreement or knowing breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement occurring prior to termination.

     (b)  Parent and the Company agree that if (x) the Company or Parent shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and (y) at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof at
which stockholders of the Company voted on the Merger) there existed an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company that had been publicly
disclosed or announced, the Company shall pay to Parent all of Parent's
reasonably documented Expenses (the "Parent Expenses") up to a maximum of $5
million within five Business Days after delivery to the Company of written

two Business Days following such termination and (ii) all of Parent Expenses (up

Business Days after delivery to the Company of written notice of the amount of
such Expenses. Parent and the Company agree that (i) if Parent shall terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(i) or Section 7.1(e)(ii), (ii) if (x)
Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(iii) and (y)
within 12 months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not such Acquisition Proposal was commenced, publicly disclosed,
publicly proposed or otherwise communicated to the Company prior to such
termination), (iii) if the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(f)(ii), or (iv) if (x) the Company or Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), (y) at the time of the event giving rise
to such termination there shall exist an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
the Company that has been publicly disclosed or announced or otherwise disclosed
to the Board of Directors of the Company and (z) within 12 months of the
termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such
Acquisition Proposal was commenced, publicly disclosed, publicly proposed or
otherwise communicated to the Company prior to such termination), then the
Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to $95 million less any previously
paid Parent Expenses paid by the Company pursuant to the first or second
sentences of this Section 7.2(b) and less any previously paid termination fee
paid by the Company pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 7.2(b), if
any (the "Termination Fee"); provided that, for purposes of this Section 7.2(b),
the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 5.4(a), except that the reference to "more than 20%" in the definition
of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%".

     (c)  The Termination Fee (i) required to be paid pursuant to clause (i) of
the third sentence of Section 7.2(b) shall be paid to Parent not later than two
Business Days following such termination, (ii) required to be paid pursuant to
clause (iii) of the third sentence of Section 7.2(b) shall be paid to Parent at

made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent.

     (d)  The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
are not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly the fee due pursuant
to this Section 7.2, the Company will also pay to Parent

                                       63

<PAGE>

Parent's reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal
action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the amount of the
unpaid fee under this Section 7.2, accruing from its due date, at an interest
rate per annum equal to two percentage points in excess of the prime commercial
lending rate quoted by Citibank, N.A. Any change in the interest rate hereunder
resulting from a change in such prime rate will be effective at the beginning of
the date of such change in such prime rate.

     7.3   Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto (or
successors thereto), by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any
such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval
by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto (or successors thereto).

     7.4   Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

     8.3   Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation".

     8.4   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

     8.5   Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. (a) This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreements, which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

     (b)   This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than
Section 5.7 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered
thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

     8.6   Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

     8.7   Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

     8.8   Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by

                                       66

<PAGE>

operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other
party, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be
null and void, except that Merger Sub may assign, prior to the Company obtaining
the Required Company Vote, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

      8.9   Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In
addition and notwithstanding any prior agreement of the parties to the contrary,
each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware
or of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware or the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware.

      8.10  Disclosure Schedules. (a) Company Disclosure Schedule. The
disclosure of any matter in a Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to be a disclosure for purposes of all other Sections of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to such
other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule is readily apparent from its
text, but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by the
Company, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is required to be disclosed
or is material for the purposes of this Agreement or otherwise.

      (b)   Parent Disclosure Schedule. The disclosure of any matter in the
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure for purposes of
all other Sections of the Parent Disclosure Schedule to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to such other Section of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule is readily apparent from its text, but shall expressly not be deemed to
constitute an admission by Parent, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter
is required to be disclosed or is material for the purposes of this Agreement or
otherwise.

     as the Advisory Contract existing on the date of this Agreement, which new
     Advisory Contract has been (and remains) duly authorized and approved under
     applicable law (including without limitation with respect to each Advisory
     Contract of a Registered Investment Company subject to this clause (A), by
     its Fund Board Approval and (except in the case of any Registered

     shareholder approval is required under applicable law) Fund Shareholder
     Approval having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect) and

     in effect as of the date of this Agreement (other than any Advisory

     Company and its Subsidiaries shall have obtained the written consent of
     such Client to the continuation of such Investment Contract notwithstanding
     the consummation of the Merger (which consent has been duly obtained by the
     Company and its Subsidiaries under applicable law and has not been

     between the Company or its applicable Subsidiary and such Client (and will
     not have been breached) after giving effect to the Closing;

            (C)   With respect to an Advisory Client that is an Investment
     Company (other than a Registered Investment Company) whose Advisory
     Contract is in effect as of the date of this Agreement, that the Company
     and its Subsidiaries (x) shall have obtained the consent and approval (as
     applicable) of any governing body of such Investment Company and of its
     investors required by the constituent documents of such Investment Company
     and applicable law of the continuation of such existing Advisory Contract
     notwithstanding the consummation of the Merger (to the extent any such
     Advisory Contract may, under the constituent documents of such Investment
     Company and applicable law, continue in effect following the Merger with
     such consent) (which consent has been duly obtained by the Company and its
     Subsidiaries under the constituent documents of such Investment Company and

                                       68

     Agreement (which new Advisory Contract has been (and remains) duly
     authorized and approved under the constituent documents of such Investment
     Company and applicable law), and in either such case such Advisory Contract
     will be in full force and effect after giving effect to the Closing; and

            (D)   With respect to an Advisory Client whose Advisory Contract is
     entered into after the date of this Agreement, that the Company or its
     applicable Subsidiary shall have obtained the written consent of such
     Client to the continuation of such Advisory Contract notwithstanding the
     consummation of the Merger (which consent has been duly obtained by the
     Company and its Subsidiaries under applicable law and has not been
     withdrawn), and such Advisory Contract will be in full force and effect
     between the Company or its applicable Subsidiary and such Client (and will
     not have been breached) after giving effect to the Closing;

provided, however, that in any of the foregoing cases (A)-(D), any Advisory
Client who has informed the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of (I) its
intention to terminate its Advisory Contract or investment relationship with the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof (whether such termination is to occur prior to

non-consent) to the assignment or deemed assignment of its Advisory Contract
resulting from the Merger, shall be deemed not to have provided its Consent for
any purpose under this Agreement; and

provided, further, that in any of the foregoing cases (A)-(D) involving a Client
where the advisory relationship between the Company or its applicable Subsidiary
and such Client is through a Financial Intermediary, such Client shall not be
deemed to have provided its Consent for any purpose under this Agreement unless
the Company or its applicable Subsidiary also shall have (x) obtained the
written consent of the Financial Intermediary to the continuation of the
Company's or its applicable Subsidiary's existing Master Agreement
notwithstanding the consummation of the Merger (to the extent any such Master
Agreement may, by its terms and under applicable law, continue in effect
following the Merger with such consent) (which consent has been duly obtained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries under the terms of such Master Agreement and
under applicable law and has not been withdrawn) or (y) entered into a new
Master Agreement with such Financial Intermediary (effective as of the Closing)
on substantially identical terms (and identical with respect to fee rates) as

law), and in either such case such Master Agreement will be in full force and
effect after giving effect to the Closing; and

provided, further, that in any of the foregoing cases (A)-(D) involving a Client
that is a trust (or similar estate planning vehicle), such Client shall not be
deemed to have provided its Consent for any purpose under this Agreement unless
(x) the Company or its applicable Subsidiary also shall have obtained the
written consent from such beneficiaries of such trust, and such approval from
any applicable court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
