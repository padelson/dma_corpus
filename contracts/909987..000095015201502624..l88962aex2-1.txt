ii  4       AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER dated as of June 17, 2001 (this "Agreement"), by and among Purina
Mills, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Land O\'Lakes, Inc., a
Minnesota cooperative corporation ("Buyer"), LOL Holdings II, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("LOL
Subsidiary"), and LOL Holdings III, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of LOL Subsidiary ("Acquisition") (the Company
and Acquisition being sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as
the "Constituent Corporations").   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the Boards of
Directors of the Company, Buyer, LOL Subsidiary and Acquisition deem a merger
of the Company and Acquisition pursuant to the terms hereof (the "Merger")
advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations and
their respective stockholders; the Boards of Directors of the Company, Buyer,
LOL Subsidiary and Acquisition have, by resolutions duly adopted, approved
this Agreement and the Merger and the Boards of Directors of the Company and
Acquisition have directed that this Agreement and the Merger be submitted to
a vote of the stockholders of their respective Constituent Corporations in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware; and LOL Subsidiary, being
the sole stockholder of Acquisition, has, by written action, approved this
Agreement and the Merger in accordance with such laws; and   WHEREAS, the
Company, LOL Subsidiary, Acquisition and Buyer desire to effect the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth below.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
premises and of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and
agreements herein contained and for the purpose of prescribing the terms and
conditions of the Merger, the manner and basis of converting shares of
capital stock of the Company into cash, and such other provisions as are
deemed necessary or desirable, the parties agree that the Merger shall be
effected on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth below and in
accordance with the applicable laws of the State of Delaware.   ARTICLE
I   THE MERGER   1.01 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, as defined in
Section 1.03, and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Law"),
Acquisition shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Acquisition shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation"), the name of which shall continue to be Purina
Mills, Inc.      1  5   1.02 SURVIVING CORPORATION. At the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter possess all
the rights, privileges, powers and franchises, of a public as well as of a
private nature, of each of the Constituent Corporations, and be subject to
all the restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Constituent
Corporations; and all and singular, the rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of each of the Constituent Corporations, and all property, real,
personal and mixed, and all debts due to each of the Constituent Corporations
on whatever account, as well for stock subscriptions as all other things in
action or belonging to each of the Constituent Corporations, shall be vested
in the Surviving Corporation; and all property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises, and all and every other interest, shall be thereafter as
effectually the property of the Surviving Corporation as they were of the
several and respective Constituent Corporations; and the title to any real
estate or any interest therein vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction, in either of the Constituent Corporations
shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Merger; but all
rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of either of the
Constituent Corporations shall be preserved unimpaired; and all debts, duties
and liabilities of either of the Constituent Corporations shall thenceforth
attach to the Surviving Corporation, and may be enforced against it to the
same extent as if said debts, duties and liabilities had been incurred or
contracted by it.   1.03 EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to and
immediately following the receipt of the vote of the stockholders of the
Company approving this Agreement and the Merger and the satisfaction or
waiver of all conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Acquisition shall execute in the manner required
by the Delaware Law and deliver for filing to the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger as
required by Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall
become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger is accepted for filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
is set forth in the Certificate of Merger, and the term "Effective Time"
shall mean the date and time when the Merger shall become effective.   1.04
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS OF THE SURVIVING  CORPORATION.  
(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition, a copy of which
is attached hereto as Exhibit A, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware, except that, from and after the Effective Time, Article I
of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to read as follows:   "ARTICLE I   The name of this Corporation
is Purina Mills, Inc."   (b) The By-Laws of Acquisition in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed, by virtue of the
Merger and without further action by the stockholders or directors of the
Surviving Corporation or Acquisition, to be the By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the laws of the State
of Delaware.    2  6   1.05 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE
SURVIVING CORPORATION. The directors of Acquisition immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of
such directors to hold office, subject to the applicable provisions of the
By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation, until the expiration of the term for
which such director was elected and until his or her successor is elected and
has qualified or as otherwise provided in the By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation. The officers of Acquisition immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are chosen and have qualified or as otherwise provided
in the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.   1.06 CONVERSION OF SHARES.
The manner and basis of converting the shares of each of the Constituent
Corporations shall be as follows:   (a) At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the "Company Common
Stock"), which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (i) Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined), and (ii)
shares of Company Common Stock held of record by Buyer, LOL Subsidiary or
Acquisition or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Buyer or the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into and represent the right to receive (as provided in Section 1.09(a)
hereof) $23.00 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), prorated for fractional
shares, if any.   (b) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of
Acquisition, par value $.01 per share, which is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
exchanged for one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, which
shall constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time.   (c) At
the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock held of record by
Buyer, LOL Subsidiary or Acquisition or any other direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Buyer or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time and each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
cease to exist at and after the Effective Time, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.   1.07 DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a holder
who has demanded and perfected the right, if any, for appraisal of those
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware Law
and as of the Effective Time has not withdrawn or lost such right to such
appraisal ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive a cash payment pursuant to Section 1.06(a), but the holder
shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the Delaware Law. If
a holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of those
shares under the Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever      3 
7  occurs later, those shares shall be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.06(a),
without interest, upon compliance with the provisions, and subject to the
limitations, of Section 1.09 hereof. The Company shall give Buyer (a) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
received by the Company relating to stockholders\' rights of appraisal, and
(b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the Delaware Law. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Buyer, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Common Stock, offer to
settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.    1.08 STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, CONVERTIBLE
NOTES.   (a) Each holder of an option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock which has been heretofore granted under any employee or director stock
option or compensation plan or other arrangement with the Company and which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "Option" and
collectively, the "Options") shall be entitled (whether or not such Option is
then exercisable) to receive in cancellation of such Option and in lieu of
any other awards with respect to such Option, promptly (but in any event
within three business days) after the Effective Time, a cash payment from the
Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the
Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Option,
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Option Settlement
Amount"), but subject to all required tax withholdings by the Surviving
Corporation. Each Option shall be cancelled immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   (b) Each holder of a stock appreciation right the payments
in respect of which are based on the value of Company Common Stock which has
been heretofore granted under the Company\'s 2000 Stock Appreciation Rights
Plan and which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each,
an "SAR" and collectively, the "SARs") shall be entitled (whether or not such
SAR is then exercisable) to receive in cancellation of such SAR and in lieu
of any other awards with respect to such SAR, promptly (but in any event
within three business days) after the Effective Time, a cash payment from the
Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the
Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such SAR,
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock equivalents, for
purposes of measuring payments under such SAR, subject to such SAR
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "SAR Settlement Amount"), but
subject to all required tax withholding of the Surviving Corporation. Each
SAR shall be cancelled effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
(c) Each holder of a then outstanding note convertible into shares of Company
Common Stock which has been heretofore issued by the Company (each, a
"Convertible Note" and collectively, the "Convertible Notes") shall
be entitled, following execution of a cancellation agreement with the
Company, to receive in cancellation of such Convertible Note, immediately
after the Effective Time, a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares
of Company Common Stock into        4  8  which the outstanding
principal of and accrued interest on such Convertible Note is convertible
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the terms of such Convertible
Note, pro rated for fractional shares (the "Convertible Note Settlement
Amount"). Each Convertible Note that is subject to a cancellation agreement
shall be cancelled without further payment upon payment of the Convertible
Note Settlement Amount for such Convertible Note.   1.09 PAYMENT FOR
SHARES.   (a) At or before the Effective Time, Buyer, LOL Subsidiary
or Acquisition shall deposit in immediately available funds with Wells Fargo
Bank Minnesota, National Association, or any other disbursing agent selected
by Buyer that is organized under the laws of the United States or any state
of the United States with capital, surplus and undivided profits of at
least $100,000,000 (the "Disbursing Agent"), an amount equal to the product
(rounded up or down to the nearest whole $.01, with $.005 rounded up to the
nearest whole $.01) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares then held of record by Buyer, LOL Subsidiary or Acquisition or any
other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Buyer or the Company), prorated for
fractional shares, times (ii) the Merger Consideration (such product being
hereinafter referred to as the "Fund"). Out of the Fund, the Disbursing Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from the holders of Company
Common Stock, make the payments referred to in Section 1.06(a) hereof,
subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this Section 1.09. At the
request of the Surviving Corporation, in its sole discretion at any time, but
without any obligation to make any such request, the Disbursing Agent also
may make payments, in discharge of any obligations of the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware Law, to holders of
Company Common Stock who have exercised dissenters\' rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the Delaware Law and have not subsequently withdrawn or lost
such rights as long as the payment from the Fund with respect to any
Dissenting Share does not exceed the Merger Consideration. The Disbursing
Agent shall invest portions of the Fund as Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
directs, provided that all such investments shall be held as cash or in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moody\'s Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, or in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers\' acceptances of commercial
banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits exceeding
$100,000,000 (collectively, "Permitted Investments"), or in money market
funds which are invested solely in Permitted Investments. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be
payable to Buyer, and shall be remitted from time to time by the Disbursing
Agent upon the request of Buyer. Any amount remaining in the Fund after six
months after the Effective Time may be refunded to the Surviving Corporation
at its option; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable for any cash payments required to be made thereafter pursuant to
Section 1.06(a) hereof and Section 262 of the Delaware Law.   (b) As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent shall mail to
each holder of record (other than Buyer, LOL Subsidiary or Acquisition or any
other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Buyer or the Company) of a certificate
or certificates (a "Certificate" or "Certificates") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (other than those holders who have
exercised dissenters\'       5  9  rights pursuant to Section 262 of
the Delaware Law and have not subsequently withdrawn or lost such rights), a
form letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") for return to the
Disbursing Agent, and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates and to receive cash for each of such holder\'s shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.06(a) hereof. The Letter of Transmittal
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of such Certificate or Certificates to the
Disbursing Agent. The Disbursing Agent, as soon as practicable
following receipt of any such Certificate or Certificates together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and any other items specified by the
Letter of Transmittal, shall pay, by check or draft, to the persons entitled
thereto, the sum (rounded up or down to the nearest whole $.01, with $.005
rounded up to the nearest whole $.01) of the amounts determined by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered (prorated for fractional
shares) by (ii) the Merger Consideration. All of the foregoing payments shall
be subject to any required withholding of taxes by the Surviving Corporation.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of
the Certificate or Certificates. If payment is to be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate or Certificates surrendered are
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting the payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that the tax has
been paid or is not applicable.   (c) In the event any such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate or
Certificates to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the amount to which such
person would have been entitled under Section 1.09(b) hereof but for failure
to deliver such Certificate or Certificates to the Disbursing Agent shall
nevertheless be paid to such person, provided that the Surviving Corporation
or the Disbursing Agent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition
precedent to such payment, require such person to give Buyer, LOL Subsidiary,
the Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent a written indemnity
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation and the Disbursing Agent and, if deemed advisable in the sole
discretion of the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent, a bond
in such sum as the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be had against Buyer, LOL Subsidiary,
the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent with respect to the
Certificate or Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   1.10 NO FURTHER RIGHTS OR TRANSFERS. At and after the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including without limitation fractional shares)
shall be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or
Certificates that represented shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates, except for the
right to surrender such holder\'s Certificate or Certificates in exchange for
the payment provided pursuant to Section 1.06(a) hereof or to perfect such
holder\'s right to receive payment for such holder\'s shares pursuant to
Section 262 of       6  10  the Delaware Law and Section 1.07 hereof
if such holder has validly exercised and not withdrawn or lost such holder\'s
right to receive payment for such holder\'s shares pursuant to Section 262 of
the Delaware Law, and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be made on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE II

reasonably objected prior to the filing of such return;   (xi) change any

MATERIAL.   (a) The Company shall cause a special meeting of its
stockholders to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable
after the execution of this Agreement for the purpose of voting on the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to the applicable
provisions of Sections 2.03(b), 5.01 and 8.04 hereof, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall recommend to the stockholders of the Company in the
Proxy Statement (as hereinafter defined) that they vote in favor of approval
of this Agreement and the Merger, and the Company shall solicit proxies in
connection with such meeting in favor of such approval, shall engage a
nationally recognized proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Buyer to
solicit such proxies, and shall otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to
secure the approval of the stockholders of the Company required to effect the
Merger under applicable law. Simultaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, GSCP Recovery, Inc. has entered into a Voting Agreement dated the
date hereof (the "Voting Agreement") with Buyer, pursuant to which,
among other agreements, it has granted to Daniel Knutson and James
Wahrenbrock, with full power of substitution, an irrevocable proxy (the
"Irrevocable Proxy") to vote all shares of Company Common Stock held of
record by such stockholder (or over which such stockholder has voting power,
by contract or otherwise) to approve this Agreement and the Merger, unless
this Agreement has been earlier terminated pursuant to Section 5.01
hereof.   (b) The Company will prepare, and file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), a proxy statement, together with a form of
proxy, with respect to the stockholders meeting described in Section 2.02(a)
as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement (such
proxy statement, together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto,
being herein called the "Proxy Statement"). The Company (i) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
soon as reasonably       10  14  practicable, if such clearance is
required, (ii) shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter mail the
Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, and (iii) shall otherwise
comply in all material respects with all applicable legal requirements in
respect of such meeting. The Company shall notify Buyer promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and any request by the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply Buyer with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement or the Merger. Prior to filing the Proxy Statement with the
SEC, the Company shall provide reasonable opportunity for Buyer to review and
comment upon the contents of the Proxy Statement and shall not include
therein any information to which counsel to Buyer shall reasonably object
(unless counsel to the Company shall reasonably determine that such
information should be included consistent with applicable legal principles)
or omit therefrom any information which counsel to Buyer shall reasonably
request. If at any time prior to the meeting of the stockholders of the
Company contemplated by Section 2.02(a), any event relating to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, officers or directors is discovered by the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly so inform Buyer.   (c) Subject to the
applicable provisions of Sections 5.01 and 8.04 hereof, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not withdraw or qualify, or propose to
withdraw or qualify, the approval or recommendation by the Board of Directors
of the Company of this Agreement or the Merger. Nothing contained in this
Section 2.02(c) shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  
2.03 NO SHOPPING.   (a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
not and shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors,
employees, financial advisors, representatives, agents, subsidiaries or
affiliates to, directly or indirectly:   (i) solicit, seek, initiate or
encourage any inquiries or  proposals that constitute, or would be reasonably
likely to lead to, a  proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation or
business combination  involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, a
sale of substantial  assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as
whole (other than  the sale or other disposition of inventory or obsolete
equipment in the  ordinary course of business consistent with past practice),
a sale of  shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries  (including without limitation by way of a tender offer) or any
similar  transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
other  than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any of the 
foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to in this Agreement as  an
"Acquisition Proposal"),   (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
any person or  group other than Buyer or its affiliates (a "Third Party")
concerning  any Acquisition       11  15   Proposal, or provide any
non-public information, or afford access to  the properties, books, records
or personnel of the Company or any of  its subsidiaries, to any Third Party
that is considering making, or has  made, any Acquisition Proposal, or  
(iii) agree to or recommend any Acquisition Proposal;  provided, however,
that nothing contained in this Section 2.03(a) shall prevent the Company from
(A) furnishing non-public information or affording access to the properties,
books, records or personnel of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal by such Third Party for a Third Party
Transaction if and only to the extent (1) the Board of Directors of
the Company, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, determines in good
faith (after consultation with the Company\'s financial and legal advisors)
that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal (as hereinafter defined), and (2) prior to furnishing such non-
public information or affording such access to the properties, books, records
and personnel of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such Third Party, the Company receives from
such Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the letter agreement
regarding confidentiality, dated May 7, 2001, from Buyer to the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"); or (B) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
agrees not to release any Third Party from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party, unless the
Board of Directors of the Company, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties,
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company\'s financial
and legal advisors) that such action is advisable. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal made by a Third
Party for a Third Party Transaction that specifies a price per share to be
paid for the Company Common Stock that is in excess of the Merger
Consideration, that was not solicited by the Company in violation of
this Agreement and that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors
of the Company, taking into account, to the extent deemed appropriate by the
Board of Directors of the Company, the various legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the person or group making
such proposal, (x) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and
(y) if consummated, would result in a transaction that is more favorable to
the Company\'s stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders), from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) If the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties (after consultation with the
Company\'s financial and legal advisors) to recommend or approve a Superior
Proposal, then the Company shall, at least five business days prior thereto,
give Buyer written notice thereof and furnish Buyer with a copy of the
definitive agreement the Company is prepared to execute with respect to the
transactions contemplated by such Superior Proposal and shall afford a
reasonable opportunity to Buyer within such five business day period to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Board of Directors of the Company to maintain its recommendation
of this Agreement and the Merger to the stockholders of the Company and
enable the Company to      12  16  proceed with the Merger on such
adjusted terms, and such Superior Proposal shall not be recommended or
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company nor shall any notice of
termination of this Agreement be given by the Company pursuant to Section
5.01(e) hereof in connection therewith if Buyer submits to the Company during
such five business day period a legally binding, executed offer to enter into
an amendment to this Agreement within such five business day period
reflecting such adjustments unless the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with the
Company\'s financial and legal advisors) that the transactions contemplated
herein as modified by the amendment to this Agreement that Buyer has agreed
to enter into during such five business day period would not, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is at least as favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) from a financial point of
view as such Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
stated herein, the Board of Directors of the Company may not recommend,
approve or accept a Superior Proposal unless the Company concurrently
therewith terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.01(e) and,
concurrently with such termination, makes the payments required by Sections
8.04(b) and 8.04(c).   (c) The Company shall notify Buyer immediately after
receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for non-public information, or for access to the properties, books,
records or personnel of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, by any Third
Party that is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable
detail the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request
(including, without limitation, the identity of the Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal or request). The Company shall continue to keep Buyer
informed, on a current basis, of the status of any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal and the terms being discussed
or negotiated (including changes or amendments thereto).   2.04 ACCESS TO
INFORMATION. The Company will give Buyer, and its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives, full access to the
offices (including a work area for the use of Buyer and its authorized
representatives), properties (including full access for purposes
of conducting any environmental analysis Buyer shall reasonably determine to
be advisable), personnel, books and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries at all reasonable times upon reasonable notice, and will
instruct the personnel, counsel, financial advisors and auditors of the
Company and its subsidiaries to cooperate in all reasonable respects with
Buyer and each such representative in its investigation of the business of
the Company and its subsidiaries, provided that no investigation pursuant to
this Section 2.04 shall affect any representation or warranty given by the
Company to Buyer, LOL Subsidiary and Acquisition hereunder or unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
Company will confer from time to time with Buyer at Buyer\'s request to
discuss the status of the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
foregoing access will be subject to the confidentiality obligations of Buyer
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.   2.05 AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION
OF COMPANY\'S EMPLOYEE PLANS. The Company will, effective at or, at the
election of Buyer, immediately prior to the Effective Time, cause any
Employee Plans (as hereinafter defined) which it may have to be amended, to
the extent, if any, reasonably requested by Buyer, for the purpose of
permitting the Employee Plans to continue to       13  17  operate in
conformity with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto
("ERISA"), and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant thereto (the "Code"), subsequent to the
Merger, and will take any actions necessary to terminate, effective at or, at
the election of Buyer, immediately prior to the Effective Time, any Employee
Plans (other than those Employee Plans discussed in the last sentence of
Section 7.04 hereof) that Buyer requests to be terminated.   2.06 STOCK
OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES.   (a) The Company
shall cause, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then
outstanding Option (whether or not such Option is then exercisable) to be
canceled in respect of a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation, payable
in accordance with Section 1.08(a), equal to the Option Settlement Amount for
such Option, subject to all applicable tax withholding. Without limiting the
generality of the immediately preceding sentence, the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee to which it shall have granted such authority
under the Company\'s 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as
of June 12, 2000, or the Company\'s Non-Employee Director and Key Employee
Equity Incentive Plan, each in the form provided to Buyer, shall cause the
surrender of all awards under each Option at or immediately prior to
the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive, in accordance with
Section 1.08(a), the Option Settlement Amount payable with respect to such
Option, subject to all applicable tax withholding. The Surviving Corporation
shall comply with all requirements regarding tax withholding in connection
with the foregoing.   (b) The Company shall cause, at or immediately prior

the SAR Settlement Amount for such SAR, subject to all applicable tax
withholding. The Surviving Corporation shall comply with all requirements
regarding tax withholding in connection with the foregoing.   (c) The
Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to cause, prior to the
Effective Time, the holder of each outstanding Convertible Note to enter into

with Section 1.08(c), equal to the Convertible Note Settlement Amount for
such Convertible Note, and (ii) give on a timely basis all notices
required to be given under the Convertible Notes in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   2.07
REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
consistent with applicable legal requirements to take, or cause to be taken,

and advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article III hereof
are satisfied and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other

in all material respects any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that the

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   6.01 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY. Except as set forth in the appropriate Section of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Buyer, LOL Subsidiary and
Acquisition, and their respective successors and assigns, as follows:   (a)
CORPORATE ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the
subsidiaries of the Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Company is incorporated in Delaware and each of its
subsidiaries is incorporated in the jurisdiction set forth opposite its name
in Section 6.01(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties owned, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities,
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except such jurisdictions
where failure to be so qualified or licensed has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has prior to the date hereof delivered to Buyer a
certified copy of its Certificate of Incorporation and its By-Laws and copies
of all similar organizational documents of its subsidiaries. Each such copy
is complete and correct in all material respects.   (b) CAPITALIZATION. The
authorized capital stock of the Company at the date hereof consists of
20,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Company
Preferred Stock. On the date hereof, 10,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of Company Common Stock were
held in the treasury of the Company. None of the shares of Company Preferred
Stock has been designated as to class or series other than 300,000 shares
designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01
per share (the "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock"), and none of
the shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding or held
in treasury by the Company. Except as set forth above in this Section
6.01(b), the Company has no other issued or outstanding shares of capital
stock. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, or other
rights to purchase Company Stock or any other capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or its subsidiaries or any calls or other
agreements or commitments by which the Company or its subsidiaries are bound
in respect of the Company Stock or other capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or its subsidiaries, whether issued or unissued,
and no outstanding securities are convertible into or exchangeable for
Company Stock or any other capital stock or other equity securities of the
Company or its subsidiaries, except for (i) the Rights Agreement dated as of
June 29, 2000 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A.
(formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A.), as amended by Amendment No.
1 to Rights Agreement dated December 4, 2000, by Amendment No. 2 to Rights
Agreement dated       22  26  May 29, 2001, and by Amendment No. 3 to
Rights Agreement dated June 17, 2001 (as so amended, the "Rights Agreement"),
pursuant to which each outstanding share of Company Common Stock has attached
to it certain rights (the "Rights"), including rights under certain
circumstances to purchase a fraction of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock for $100 or Company Common Stock at one-half of
its market price, subject to adjustment, (ii) Options to purchase up to an
aggregate of 1,100,000 shares of Company Common Stock, and (iii)
the Convertible Notes. There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights,
phantom stock rights, performance shares or other similar rights based upon
the value of the Company Stock or any other capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or its subsidiaries, except SARs equivalent, for
purposes of measuring payments thereunder, to an aggregate of 277,000 shares
of Company Common Stock. Section 6.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule lists,
(x) for each of the Options and Convertible Notes, the person holding such
security, the number of shares of Company Common Stock presently subject to
such security, the present exercise price of such security, and the
expiration date of such security, and (y) for each of the SARs, the person
holding such SAR, the number of shares of Company Common Stock equivalents,
for purposes of measuring payments thereunder, presently subject to such SAR,
the present exercise price of such SAR, and the expiration date of such SAR.
The closing sales price of the Company Common Stock on the effective date of
grant of each SAR, as reported on the NASDAQ National Market System, does not
exceed the per share Merger Consideration. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of the Company and its subsidiaries
are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Section 6.01(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name of each subsidiary of the Company and
the percentage of the outstanding capital stock or other equity securities of
such subsidiary owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. All of such
capital stock or other equity securities are owned, directly or indirectly,
by the Company free and clear of all restrictions and encumbrances other than
restrictions on transfer imposed by federal and state securities laws. The
Company owns no other equity securities of or equity interest in any other
entity. None of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the Options
or Convertible Notes were granted in violation of preemptive or similar
rights. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which the
Company otherwise has knowledge with respect to the voting of capital stock
of the Company.   (c) AUTHORITY. The Company has the corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company have been duly and effectively authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Company, and, except for approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of the Company as provided in
Section 3.01(b) hereof, no further corporate action is necessary on the part
of the Company to authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of Buyer, LOL Subsidiary and Acquisition set forth in Section 6.02(b),
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement       23 
27  is sought in a court of law or equity). Notwithstanding anything stated
herein, the consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 3.02 hereof. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor the consummation by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(i) will conflict with or result in a breach of the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws or similar organizational documents, as currently in
effect, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) require the
consent or approval of, or any filing with, any governmental authority having
jurisdiction over any of the business or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule
or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their properties or assets, or result in a breach of, or constitute a default
or an event which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
would constitute a default, give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration, create any entitlement to any payment or benefit, require
notice to or the consent of any third party, or result in the creation of a
lien on any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries under, any other instrument, contract or agreement to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or
any of their properties or assets may be bound, except, in the case of clause
(ii), (A) the filing with the SEC of (1) the Proxy Statement, and (2) such
reports under Section 13(a), 13(d) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as may be
required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (B) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation, (C) the filing of a premerger notification and
report form by the Company under the HSR Act, and (D) where such violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations, payments,
benefits or liens, or the failure to obtain, make or give such consents,
approvals, filings or notices, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or to impair the
Company\'s ability to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.   (d) NO PROCEEDINGS. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor the consummation by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated hereby,
are being challenged by or are the subject of any pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation or governmental investigation
or proceeding as of the date of this Agreement.   (e) SECURITIES

material fact or omitted to state any fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made,       24  28  not
misleading and each SEC Report at the time of its filing complied as to

timely manner all reports that it was required to file with the SEC pursuant
to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Each of the
consolidated financial statements contained in the SEC Reports was prepared

by the Company of "fresh-start" reporting) and each fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows and changes in stockholders\' equity of the
Company and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated, subject in the case
of quarterly financial statements to normal year-end adjustments and except
that the quarterly financial statements do not contain all of the footnote
disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles to the
extent permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC.   (ii) The Proxy
Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
Company\'s stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and will not, at the time of the meeting
of stockholders to which the Proxy Statement relates or at the Effective
Time, omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement
which has become false or misleading in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for such meeting, except that
no representation is made by the Company with respect to statements made in
the Proxy Statement based on information furnished in writing to the Company
by Buyer, LOL Subsidiary or Acquisition specifically for use in the
Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder.   (f) TAXES.   (i) Each of the Company

accurate in all material respects.   (ii) Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries has paid all material federal, state, local and foreign taxes
and all other material assessments, deficiencies, levies, imposts, duties,
license fees, registration fees, withholdings or other similar governmental

or additions to tax imposed thereon (collectively, the "Taxes"), due or
claimed by any taxing authority to be due by it, and, as of the date of the
Company\'s most recent audited consolidated balance sheet contained in the
SEC Reports delivered prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Balance
Sheet"), none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries had any material
liability for Taxes (including without limitation any material liability to
indemnify or reimburse any other person for Taxes under any       25 
29  tax indemnity, tax allocation or tax sharing agreement) other than as
reserved for on the Balance Sheet.   (iii) All material amounts required to
be withheld or collected by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for income
taxes, social security taxes, unemployment insurance taxes and other employee
withholding taxes have been so withheld or collected and either paid to the
appropriate governmental authority or, if not delinquent, accrued and
reserved against and entered upon the consolidated books of the Company and
its subsidiaries.   (iv) For federal income tax purposes, all tax years
ending on or before December 31, 1994 are closed or the statute of
limitations has expired with respect thereto. There is no material action,
suit, proceeding, audit, investigation or claim pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened in respect of any Taxes for which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries may become liable, and no material claims have been
made by any taxing authority of any jurisdiction in which any of the Company
or its subsidiaries does not file tax returns that the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. No
presently effective waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to any
taxable year has been executed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries,

Section 168(h) of the Code.   (vi) Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has made any payment, or is a party to any contract, agreement
or arrangement which could obligate it to make any payment, that would, but

Code.   (vii) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to
any tax indemnity, tax allocation or tax sharing agreement.   (viii) Neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated

any of its subsidiaries has filed a consent under Section 341(f) of the Code
concerning collapsible corporations.   (x) Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has been a United States real property holding corporation

30   (xi) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has distributed
the stock of a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of that term as
used in Section 355(a) of the Code) in a transaction subject to Section 355
of the Code within the past two years.   (xii) Neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries will be required to include any material item of income
in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Effective Time as a

corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income tax
law); (B) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or

prepaid amount received at or prior to the Effective Time.   (g) ABSENCE OF
CHANGES. Except for liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and except as disclosed in the SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, from the date of the
Balance Sheet through the date of this Agreement, the Company and its
subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice, and there has not been (i) any
damage, destruction or loss, whether covered by insurance or not, that has
had or is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any other event, development or condition

Agreement.   (h) PROPERTIES.   (i) The Company and its subsidiaries have
good and marketable title to all property, assets and rights reflected in the

liens and encumbrances disclosed in the Balance Sheet (or in the notes

leasehold interests or other rights to use, or the existence of such
mortgages, liens, pledges, charges, restrictions, encroachments, rights of
third parties or other encumbrances, has not had and is not reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

specifications, are used by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the
conduct of their business, except the Owned Intellectual Property or those
licensed pursuant to licenses listed in Section 6.01(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule or the non-disclosure of which therein does not constitute a
misrepresentation under Section 6.01(i) of this Agreement (the "Licensed
Intellectual Property"). The operation by the Company and its subsidiaries of
their business has not infringed in any material respect on any patent,
trademark, trade name, service mark or copyright of any other person, and
none of the Company or its subsidiaries has made use of any
invention, process, technique, confidential information, product formulation
or specification, or other trade secret in violation in any material respect
of the rights of any other person, and, as of the date of this Agreement,
the Company has no knowledge of any allegations by any other person to
the contrary. The Company has no knowledge of any pending patent, trademark,
trade name, service mark or copyright application of any other person which,
if issued or registered, would be infringed upon by the operations of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case in a way which is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no
other person is infringing in any respect upon the Owned Intellectual
Property or the Licensed Intellectual Property or is making use of any
invention, process, technique, confidential information, product formulation
or specification, or other trade secret in violation of the rights of any of
the Company or its subsidiaries, nor would any other person be infringing in
any respect upon any pending patent, trademark, trade name, service mark or
copyright application of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the event
that any of the foregoing becomes registered or issued, in any case in a way
which has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and its subsidiaries have taken all steps reasonably required to
maintain the Owned Intellectual Property and, to the knowledge of the
Company, the licensor thereof has taken all steps reasonably required to
maintain the Licensed Intellectual Property, including timely payment of all
fees and timely filing of all documents required under intellectual property
laws and regulations, except where the failure to timely pay such fees or
timely file such documents has not had and is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. None of the
Company or its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any licensor
or licensee thereof has used or enforced, or failed to use or enforce, any of
the Owned Intellectual Property or the Licensed Intellectual Property in any
manner which is reasonably likely to limit its validity or result in its
invalidity, or has received any notice that any of the Owned Intellectual
Property or the Licensed Intellectual Property has been declared
unenforceable or otherwise invalid by any governmental entity, except where
such invalidity or unenforceability has not had and is not reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. No
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries have any rights with
respect to any of the Owned Intellectual Property.      30  34   (k)
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. There are no liabilities of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, other than (i)
liabilities disclosed or set forth in the Balance Sheet, (ii) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the Balance
Sheet, provided that the existence of any such liability does not otherwise
constitute a misrepresentation under this Agreement, (iii) liabilities that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect, provided that the existence of any such
liability does not otherwise constitute a misrepresentation under this
Agreement, (iv) liabilities under, or required to be incurred under, this
Agreement, and (v) liabilities (other than those in default) under contracts
and agreements set forth in Section 6.01(h) or 6.01(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule or the non-disclosure of which therein does not constitute a
misrepresentation under Section 6.01(h) or 6.01(i) of this Agreement.   (l)
LITIGATION. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no claims (including
product liability claims), litigation, arbitrations,
administrative proceedings, abatement orders or investigations of any kind
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Company, against any
of their respective officers, employees or directors in connection with the
business or affairs of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which, if
decided adversely to the Company, such subsidiary, or such officer, employee
or director, are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect. There are no judgments, orders, writs,
injunctions, decrees, indictments, subpoenas or civil investigative demands
or awards against the Company or any of its subsidiaries that have had or are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.   (m) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries has complied with, and is not in default under or in violation
of, any laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental restrictions,
orders, judgments or decrees applicable to it or its properties or assets

defaults or violations have not had and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and, as of the
date hereof, to the Company\'s knowledge, there have been no allegations by
any governmental authority or private persons to the contrary.   (n)
LICENSES AND PERMITS. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has in full
force and effect all licenses, franchises, permits and other governmental
authorizations necessary to permit it to lawfully conduct its business in the
manner presently conducted and to own and use its properties and assets in
the manner presently owned and used, and neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is in violation of any such license, franchise, permit or other
governmental authorization, except where the failure to have in full
force and effect any such license, franchise, permit or authorization or the
existence of any such violation has not had and is not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. No such
license, franchise, permit or other governmental authorization will terminate
or lapse as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except to the extent any such termination or lapse is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.      31  35   (o) BROKERS; FINDERS. Except for the
fees of Greenwich Street Capital Partners II, L.P. as financial advisor to
the Company, and the fees of Goldman, Sachs and Co. due in connection with the
rendering of the fairness opinion referred to in Section 6.01(y) hereof, all
of which fees the Company agrees to pay, there are no claims for brokerage
commissions, finders\' fees, investment advisory fees or similar compensation
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, based on any arrangement, understanding, commitment or agreement
made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, obligating
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or Buyer, LOL Subsidiary or
Acquisition, to pay such claim. The Company has delivered to Buyer a true and
correct copy of all agreements under which any fees or other remuneration are
due from the Company or any of its subsidiaries to Greenwich Street Capital
Partners II, L.P. in connection with the performance of its services as such
financial advisor or to Goldman, Sachs and Co. in connection with the rendering
of such opinion.   (p) EMPLOYEE PLANS. Except as disclosed in the SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement:   (i) Each employee
pension benefit plan ("Pension Plan"), as such term is defined in Section 3
of ERISA, each employee welfare benefit plan ("Welfare Plan"), as such term
is defined in Section 3 of ERISA, and each deferred compensation, bonus,
incentive, stock incentive, option, stock purchase, severance, or other
employee benefit plan, agreement, commitment or arrangement which is
maintained by the Company or any of its Affiliates (as hereinafter defined),
or to which the Company or any of its Affiliates contributes or is under any
obligation to contribute, or with respect to which the Company or any of its
Affiliates has any liability (whether current or contingent) (each, an
"Employee Plan" and collectively, the "Employee Plans") is listed in Section
6.01(p) of the Disclosure Schedule, and a copy of each Employee Plan which is
a written plan has been made available to Buyer. In addition, copies of the
most recent determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service and,
if applicable, the most recent actuarial reports or valuations with respect
to each Pension Plan, copies of the most recent summary plan description for
each Pension Plan and each Welfare Plan, copies of any trust agreement,
insurance contract or other funding or investment arrangements for the
benefits under each Pension Plan and each Welfare Plan, and copies of the
annual reports (Form 5500 Series) required to be filed with any
governmental agency for each Pension Plan and each Welfare Plan for the three
most recent plan years of each such plan, have been made available to
Buyer.   (ii) Each of the Company and its Affiliates has made on a
timely basis all contributions or payments required to be made by it pursuant
to the terms of the Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code or other applicable laws,
unless such contributions or payments that have not been made are immaterial
in amount and the failure to make such payments or contributions will not
materially and adversely affect the Employee Plans. With respect to each
Pension Plan which is subject to Title I, Subtitle B, Part 3 of ERISA
(concerning "Funding"), the funding method used in connection with such
Pension Plan is acceptable under ERISA and the actuarial assumptions used in
connection with funding such Pension Plan, in the aggregate, are reasonable
(taking into account the experience of such Pension Plan and reasonable
expectations). The       32  36  actuarial present value (based upon
the same actuarial assumptions that would apply if such Pension Plan was
terminated at the Effective Time) of all vested and nonvested accrued
benefits (whether on account of retirement, termination, death or disability)
under each such Pension Plan does not exceed the net fair market value of the
assets held to fund each such Pension Plan by more than the amount, if any,
set forth with respect to such Pension Plan in Section 6.01(p) of the
Disclosure Schedule.   (iii) Each Employee Plan (and any related trust or
other funding instrument) has been administered in all respects in compliance
with its terms and in both form and operation is in compliance in all
respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable laws and regulations, and all reports required to be filed with
any government agency with respect to each Pension Plan and each Welfare Plan
have been timely filed, except in any case as has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has no knowledge of facts that would cause the
Internal Revenue Service to disqualify any Pension Plan which is intended to
be a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.   (iv) There are
no inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") or any participant or
beneficiary with respect to any Employee Plan or any other employee benefit
plan, agreement, commitment or arrangement in the past maintained by the
Company or any of its Affiliates or to which the Company or any of its
Affiliates has ever been under an obligation to contribute which, if decided
adversely to the Company or any of its Affiliates, are reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any plan fiduciary
of any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan has engaged in any transaction in
violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA (for which no exemption exists
under Section 408 of ERISA) or any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code) for which no exemption exists under Section
4975(c)(2) or 4975(d) of the Code (except where any such violation or
prohibited transaction has not had and is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect), or is subject
to any material excise tax imposed by the Code or ERISA with respect to any
Employee Plan.   (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has ever
been a sponsor of, contributed to, or been under an obligation to contribute
to any "multiemployer plan", as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA.   (vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has any
unpaid material liability to the PBGC. The Company has paid all material
premiums (and interest and penalties for late payments, if applicable) due
the PBGC with respect to each Pension Plan for each plan year thereof for
which such premiums are required. In addition, no "reportable event" (as
defined in Section 4043(b) of ERISA) has taken place with respect to any
Employee Plan and no filing has been made by the Company or any Affiliate
with the PBGC or the Internal Revenue Service to terminate any Employee
Plan.      33  37   (vii) Except as provided for in this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates is a party to any oral or
written (A) agreement with any director, officer or other employee of the
Company or any of its Affiliates the benefits of which are contingent, or the
terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction
involving the Company of the nature contemplated by this Agreement, or (B)
agreement or plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the
vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of
the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (viii) No Employee Plan
provides health, dental or life insurance benefits to any employee of the
Company or an Affiliate, or any dependent of such an employee, following
termination of the employee\'s employment, except as may be required by
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar state law.   (ix) For purposes of
this Section 6.01(p), the term "Affiliate" includes (A) any trade or business
with which the Company is, or at any time since January 1, 1996 was, under
common control within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA, (B) any

any time since January 1, 1996 was, under common control within the meaning
of Section 414(c) of the Code, (D) any entity with which the Company is, or

service group within the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code, and (E) any
entity with which the Company is, or at any time since January 1, 1996 was,
aggregated under Section 414(o) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary stated in this Section 6.01(p), (1) any representation in this
Section 6.01(p) given with respect to a trade, business or entity which would
not have been an Affiliate under the aforesaid definition had the references
in such definition to the date "January 1, 1996" instead been references to
"June 29, 2000" (a "Pre-Bankruptcy Affiliate"), or with respect to any
employee benefit plan, agreement, commitment or arrangement which would not
have been an Employee Plan but for any Pre-Bankruptcy Affiliate maintaining
or contributing thereto or being under any obligation to contribute thereto
or having any liability in respect thereof (a "Pre-Bankruptcy Affiliate
Plan"), shall be made only to the Company\'s knowledge, (2) no Pre-Bankruptcy
Affiliate Plan shall be required to be listed in Section 6.01(p) of the
Disclosure Schedule, and (3) no copies of any Pre-Bankruptcy Affiliate Plan,
or of any documents related thereto, shall be required to be delivered to
Buyer.   (q) LABOR MATTERS. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed

to, any pending or threatened action, cause of action, claim or investigation
alleging liability under or non-compliance with any applicable federal, state
or local laws or regulations relating to pollution or the protection of human
health or the environment ("Environmental Laws"), except for such actions,
causes of action, claims or investigations which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) To the knowledge of the
Company, there has been no spill, discharge, leak, emission, injection,
disposal, escape, dumping or release of any kind (collectively, "Release") of
any pollutants, contaminants, hazardous substances, hazardous chemicals,
toxic substances, hazardous wastes, infectious wastes, radioactive materials,

Environmental Law ("Hazardous Materials"), on, beneath, above or into any of
the real property currently owned, leased or operated by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Current Property") or any of the real
property formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its

or by any other person under the control of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, for the storage, disposal, generation, manufacture, refinement,

Company, (A) there are no underground storage tanks, injection wells or
landfills located on any of the Current Property, and (B) there are no
asbestos-containing materials or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) located on
any of the Current Property in such form, quantities or condition so as to
create any material liability or obligation of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries under any Environmental Laws.   (s) SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS.
Section 6.01(s) of the Disclosure Schedule lists the names of the 50 largest

that none of the execution of the Voting Agreement, the granting of
the Irrevocable Proxy or any acquisition of beneficial ownership of Company
Common Stock by Buyer, LOL Subsidiary, Acquisition or any of Buyer\'s other
affiliates after the execution of this Agreement will limit, delay or impair

Company under or with respect to an Employee Plan, as provided in the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or the certificate or
articles of incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational documents of any

from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be

annual premium equal to the DandO; Cap, or (b) a run-off (i.e., "tail") policy
or endorsement with respect to the current policy of directors\' and

containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous in any
material respects to such Indemnified Parties and other Covered Employees
thereunder) covering such Indemnified Parties and other Covered Employees
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.03
more than an amount per year equal to 150% of the current annual
premium (which current annual premium for the policy year ending December 31,
2001 the Company represents and warrants to be approximately $17,000 in the
aggregate) paid by the Company for such existing insurance coverage (the
"Fiduciary Cap"); and provided, further, that if equivalent coverage cannot
be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of
the Fiduciary Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain
as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the
Fiduciary Cap, or (b) a run-off (i.e., "tail") policy or endorsement with
respect to the current policy of liability insurance maintained by the
Company for Indemnified Parties and other Covered Employees who have served
as fiduciaries under or with respect to any Employee Plan at the request of
the Company covering such Indemnified Parties and other Covered Employees

foregoing, (a) for the two year period following the Effective Time, Buyer
will provide, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to
provide, for the benefit of the retired and terminated employees of the
Company who satisfy the current eligibility requirements of the Company\'s
Retiree Medical Plan, access to medical coverage under one or more of the
Surviving Corporation\'s medical plans (as in effect from time to

thereof; and (b) Buyer will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue and maintain in effect the Company\'s Capital Accumulation Plan (as

stockholders, propose, a Third Party Transaction, and (iii) within one year
