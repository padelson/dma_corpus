 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 24, 2016, is entered into
by and among Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, a Delaware corporation ("
**Houston** "), Everett SpinCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
Subsidiary of Houston (" **Everett** "), Computer Sciences Corporation, a
Nevada corporation (" **Chicago** "), and Everett Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware
corporation and newly formed, wholly owned Subsidiary of Chicago (" **Merger
Sub** "). Each of the foregoing parties is referred to herein as a " **Party**
" and collectively as the " **Parties** ".

 



 

 **WHEREAS:**

 



 

(1) Everett is a newly formed, wholly owned, direct Subsidiary of Houston;

 



 

(2) on or prior to the Distribution Date, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Houston
will consummate the Reorganization;

 



 

(3) prior to the Distribution, in consideration of the transfer to Everett of
the Everett Assets contemplated by the Reorganization, Everett will distribute
to Houston the Everett Debt and a cash dividend in an aggregate amount equal
to the Basis Amount;

 



 

(4) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Separation
and Distribution Agreement, on the Distribution Date, Houston will either (a)
distribute all the shares of Everett Common Stock to Houston shareholders
without consideration on a _pro rata_ basis (the " **One-Step Spin-Off** "),
or (b) consummate an offer to exchange (the " **Exchange Offer** ") shares of
Everett Common Stock for outstanding shares of Houston Common Stock and, in
the event that Houstons shareholders subscribe for less than all of the
Everett Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, Houston will distribute, _pro
rata_ to its shareholders, any unsubscribed Everett Common Stock on the
Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer
(the " **Clean-Up Spin-Off** ");

 



 

(5) the disposition by Houston of 100% of the Everett Common Stock, whether by
way of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer (followed by any Clean-Up
Spin-Off) is referred to as the " **Distribution** ", and the Distribution
together with the Reorganization is referred to as the " **Separation** ";

 



 

(6) unless the Alternative Transaction Structure is adopted pursuant to
_Section 2.7_, following the Distribution, at the Effective Time, the Parties
will effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into Everett, with Everett
continuing as the surviving corporation, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

 



 

(7) the board of directors of Chicago (the " **Chicago Board** ") (a) has
determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable, fair to, and in
the best interests of, Chicago and its shareholders and has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and
the issuance of shares of Chicago Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (the "
**Chicago Share Issuance** "), and (b) has unanimously resolved to recommend
the approval by the shareholders of Chicago of the Chicago Share Issuance;

 



      
 

 



 

(8) the board of directors of Merger Sub has determined that the Merger and
this Agreement are advisable and has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

 



 

(9) the board of directors of Everett (the " **Everett Board** ") has
determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and has approved
this Agreement and the Merger;

 



 

(10) the board of directors of Houston (the " **Houston Board** ") has
approved this Agreement and the Merger; and

 



 

(11) it is the intention of the Parties that, for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes: (a) the Contribution and the Distribution qualify as tax-free under
Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Code; (b) the Merger qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; (c) no
income, gain or loss be recognized as a result of such transactions by any of
Houston, Everett, Chicago, their respective Subsidiaries, the holders of
Everett Common Stock (except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Chicago Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3_) or the
holders of Houston Common Stock (except with respect to the receipt of cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Everett Common Stock, if any); and (d) each of
this Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations.

 **2.** ** 
THE MERGER**

 



 

 **2.1** **The Merger**

 



 

Unless the Alternative Transaction Structure is adopted pursuant to _Section
2.7_, at the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Everett (the "
**Merger** ") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Everett shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the "
**Surviving Corporation** ") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights,
powers and privileges and be subject to all of the obligations of Merger Sub
in accordance with the DGCL. As a result of the Merger, Everett shall become a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Chicago. References herein to "Everett" with
respect to the period from and after the Effective Time shall be deemed to be
references to the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the effects of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger
and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

 **2.2** **Closing**

 



 

Unless the transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned and this
Agreement terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the closing of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (the " **Closing** ") shall take
place at 9 a.m., Eastern time, on the date which is the third (3rd) Business
Day after the conditions set forth in _Section 8_ (other than those,
including the Reorganization and the Distribution, that are to be satisfied by
action at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waived, unless Chicago shall have notified Houston in writing
of its election to close on the last Business Day of the month during which
such conditions are satisfied, or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waived, in each case at the offices of Allen and Overy, LLP, 1221 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, NY 10020, unless another date, time or place is agreed to
in writing by Houston and Chicago. The date on which the Closing actually
occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " **Closing Date**."

 



 

 **2.3** **Effective Time**

 



 

On the Closing Date, Everett and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the " **Certificate of Merger** ") with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger
shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later time as Chicago and Everett shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes effective being the
" **Effective Time** ").

 



 

 **2.4** **Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation**

 



 

(a) The certificate of incorporation of Everett shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in
_Exhibit B_ to this Agreement and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until

 



      
 

 



 

thereafter duly amended in accordance with such certificate of incorporation,
this Agreement and applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The bylaws of Everett shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and
restated in their entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit C_ to this
Agreement and, as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter duly amended in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, such bylaws, this
Agreement and applicable Law.

 



 

 **2.5** **Governance Matters**

 



 

(a) The Chicago Board shall take all action necessary such that, effective as
of the Effective Time, the Chicago Board shall consist of ten (10) members,
including five (5) individuals selected by Houston (the " **Houston Designated
Directors** ") who meet Chicagos current director eligibility requirements
and who are reasonably approved by a majority of the Joint Transition
Committee on the basis of their industry and other relevant experience, one of
whom is expected to be Houstons Chief Executive Officer, who shall be
appointed to the Chicago Board, as well as five (5) current members of the
Chicago Board, one of whom shall be Chicagos current Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and the other four of whom shall be determined by a majority
of the Joint Transition Committee on the basis of their industry and other
relevant experience; _provided_ that if, at any time prior to the second
annual meeting of the Chicago shareholders that occurs after the Effective
Time, any of the Houston Designated Directors is unable or unwilling to serve
or is otherwise no longer serving as a member of the Chicago Board, then
Houston shall select a replacement individual reasonably satisfactory to the
Nominating Committee of the Chicago Board (a " **Replacement Houston
Designee** ") to fill the vacancy created thereby. Each of the Houston
Designated Directors shall qualify as an "independent director", as such term
is defined in the rules and regulations of the NYSE. In addition, Chicago
shall cause each such Houston Designated Director or Replacement Houston
Designee, as applicable, to be included in the slate of nominees recommended
by the Chicago Board to Chicagos shareholders for election as directors at
the next annual meeting of Chicago shareholders to occur following the
Effective Time and shall use no less rigorous efforts to cause the election of
each such Houston Designated Director or Replacement Houston Designee, as
applicable, including soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such
Persons, at such annual meeting than the manner in which Chicago supports all
other nominees.

 



 

(b) The Joint Transition Committee shall approve the Houston Designated
Directors and determine the continuing members of the Chicago Board, as well
as the initial committee assignments of the Chicago Board after the Effective
Time on the basis of which candidates have the most relevant applicable
experience.

 



 

(c) The members of the management of Chicago and Everett following the Closing
shall be determined by the Chief Executive Officer of Chicago.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Chicago and Everett as
set forth on _Section 2.5(b)_ of the Chicago Disclosure Schedule shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation. Such officers shall hold office
until their successors are duly appointed and

 



      
 

 



 

qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub shall be
the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation. Such directors shall serve
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 



 

 **2.6** **Name**

 



 

The name of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time shall be "Everett
SpinCo, Inc.".

 



 

 **2.7** **Alternative Transaction Structure**

 



 

Chicago and Houston shall promptly engage in good faith discussions regarding
the most appropriate structure to apply to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If Chicago and Houston mutually agree in writing to do so,
prior to the initial filing of the Chicago Registration Statement, the
structure of the Merger shall be changed such that for all purposes hereunder
the Merger shall consist of Chicago merging with a newly formed, wholly owned
Subsidiary of Everett, with Chicago remaining as the surviving corporation
(the " **Alternative Transaction Structure** "). If the Alternative
Transaction Structure is adopted in accordance with the preceding sentence,
(i) all relevant provisions of _Sections 2_ and _3_ shall be amended _mutatis
mutandi_ to refer to the Alternative Transaction Structure, (ii) all filings
with the SEC and other regulators shall be made or amended, as the case may
be, reflecting the Alternative Transaction Structure and (iii) the Parties
shall amend and restate this Agreement to reflect the foregoing.

 



 

 **3.** ** 
CONVERSION OF SHARES**

 



 

 **3.1** **Effect on Capital Stock**

 



 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Everett, Merger Sub or any holder of the capital stock of Houston,
Everett, Merger Sub or Chicago:

 



 

(a) Conversion of Everett Capital Stock

 



 

(i) Each share of Everett Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with _Section
3.1(a)(ii))_ shall be automatically converted into the right to receive a
number of shares or, subject to _Section 3.3_, a fraction of a share of
Chicago Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment in
accordance with _Section 3.1(a)(iv)_.

 



 

(ii) Each share of Everett Common Stock held by Everett as treasury stock or
by Chicago, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist and no stock or other consideration shall be
issued or delivered in exchange therefor.

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) Each share of Everett Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this _Section
3.1_, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of such shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Chicago
Common Stock as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ and any dividends or
distributions and other amounts payable in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_.

 



 

(iv) The Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, split-up,
reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution of Chicago Common Stock or
Everett Common Stock, or securities convertible into any such securities,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Chicago Common Stock or Everett Common Stock having a record date
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, other than the Reorganization; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
3.1(a)(iv)_ shall be construed to permit Houston, Everett or Chicago to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Merger Sub Common Stock

 



 

At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub (" **Merger Sub Common Stock** ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) Chicago Common Stock

 



 

Each share of Chicago Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to and at the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Exchange Ratio True-Up

 



 

If the percentage of outstanding shares of Chicago Common Stock to be received
in the Merger by former Everett shareholders with respect to Qualified Everett
Common Stock would be less than 50.1% of all Chicago Common Stock outstanding
immediately following the consummation of the Merger (determined (i) after
giving effect to the issuance of all shares of Chicago Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(i) and (ii) without regard to any adjustment
pursuant to this _Section 3.1(d)_) (the " **Threshold Percentage** "), then
upon Houstons election, the aggregate number of shares of Chicago Common
Stock into which the shares of Everett Common Stock are converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)(i)_ shall be increased such that the number of shares of
Chicago Common Stock to be received in the Merger by former Everett
shareholders with respect to Qualified Everett Common Stock equals the
Threshold Percentage. If any such increase is required, then the amount of
Everett Debt distributed pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(ii)_ of the Separation
and Distribution Agreement shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
product of $34.45 multiplied by the number of additional shares of Chicago
Common Stock required to be issued pursuant to the true-up set forth in this
_Section 3.1(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the preceding clause shall
apply only if Houston acted in a way that caused the failure to

 



      
 

 



 

meet the Threshold Percentage in the absence of the increase in Chicago Common
Stock issued pursuant to this _Section 3.1(d)_.

 



 

 **3.2** **Distribution of Per Share Merger Consideration**

 



 

(a) Agent

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, Houston will appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Chicago as distribution agent (the " **Agent** ").
Prior to or at the Effective Time, Chicago shall deposit with the Agent, for
the benefit of Persons who received shares of Everett Common Stock in the
Distribution and for distribution in accordance with this _Section 3_,
through the Agent, book-entry authorizations representing the shares of
Chicago Common Stock (such shares of Chicago Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions and other amounts payable in accordance with
_Section 3.2(c)_, being hereinafter referred to as the " **Distribution
Fund** ") issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ upon conversion of outstanding
shares of Everett Common Stock. The Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Chicago Common Stock contemplated to be issued
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ from the shares of Chicago Common Stock held in the
Distribution Fund. If Chicago deposits such shares into the Distribution Fund
prior to the Effective Time and the Merger is not consummated, the Agent shall
promptly return such shares to Chicago. The Distribution Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) Distribution Procedures

 



 

At the Effective Time, all issued and outstanding shares of Everett Common
Stock shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Chicago Common
Stock pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of this Agreement.
Immediately thereafter, the Agent shall distribute the shares of Chicago
Common Stock into which the shares of Everett Common Stock that were
distributed in the Distribution have been converted pursuant to the Merger,
which shares shall be distributed on the same basis as the shares of Everett
Common Stock were distributed in the Distribution and to the Persons who
received Everett Common Stock in the Distribution. Each Person entitled to
receive Everett Common Stock in the Distribution shall be entitled to receive
in respect of the shares of Everett Common Stock distributed to such Person a
book-entry authorization representing the number of whole shares of Chicago
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
_Section 3.2(b)_ (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Chicago Common
Stock, as contemplated by _Section 3.3_) (and any dividends or distributions
and other amounts pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_). The Agent shall not be
entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to Chicago
Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with
respect thereto for the account of Persons entitled thereto.

 



 

(c) Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares

 



 

No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Chicago Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid with respect to any shares of Chicago Common Stock that are
not able to be distributed by the Agent promptly after the Effective Time,
whether due to a legal impediment to such distribution or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following the
distribution of any such previously undistributed shares of Chicago Common
Stock, there shall be paid to the record holder of such shares of Chicago
Common Stock, without interest, (i) at the time of the distribution, to the
extent not previously paid, the amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares of Chicago Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Chicago Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
therefor, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to the distribution of such shares and a
payment date subsequent to the distribution of such shares payable with
respect to such whole shares of Chicago Common Stock. Chicago shall deposit in
the Distribution Fund all such dividends and distributions.

 



 

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Everett Common Stock

 



 

All shares of Chicago Common Stock issued in respect of shares of Everett
Common Stock (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 3.3_) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Everett Common Stock.

 



 

(e) Termination of Distribution Fund

 



 

Any portion of the Distribution Fund made available to the Agent that remains
undistributed to the former stockholders of Everett on the one-year
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Chicago, and any
former stockholders of Everett who have not received shares of Chicago Common
Stock in accordance with this _Section 3_ shall thereafter look only to
Chicago for payment of their claim for Chicago Common Stock and any dividends,
distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares with respect to Chicago
Common Stock (subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law).

 



 

(f) No Liability

 



 

Neither Houston, the Surviving Corporation, Chicago, Merger Sub, the Agent nor
any other Person shall be liable to any holder of Everett Common Stock or any
holder of shares of Houston Common Stock for shares of Chicago Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto or with respect to Everett
Common Stock) or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) Closing of Transfer Books

 



 

From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Everett shall
be closed and no transfer shall be made of any shares of capital stock of
Everett that were outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) Tax Withholding

 



 

Chicago or the Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Everett Common Stock such

 



      
 

 



 

amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient.

 



 

 **3.3** **Fractional Shares**

 



 

(a) No fractional shares of Chicago Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Everett Common Stock otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of Chicago Common Stock will be entitled to
receive, from the Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
3.3_, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of Chicago Common Stock
representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds
from the sale by the Agent (reduced by any fees of the Agent attributable to
such sale) in one or more transactions of shares of Chicago Common Stock equal
to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Chicago Common Stock to
be delivered to the Agent by Chicago pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ over (ii)
the aggregate number of whole shares of Chicago Common Stock to be distributed
to the holders of shares of Everett Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_
(such excess, the " **Excess Shares** "). Houston, Everett, Chicago and Merger
Sub acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of Chicago Common Stock was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Chicago that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Chicago Common Stock. As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, the Agent, as agent for the holders
of Everett Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of
Chicago Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices
on the NYSE in the manner provided in the following paragraph.

 



 

(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Agent, as agent for the holders of
Everett Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Chicago
Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in round
lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have
been distributed to the holders of Everett Common Stock, the Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the holders of Everett Common Stock that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of Chicago Common Stock (the " **Common
Shares Trust** "). The Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares
Trust to which each holder of Everett Common Stock shall be entitled, if any,
by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common
Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the
fractional share interest to which such holder of Everett Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of Everett Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled.

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Everett Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
shares of Chicago Common Stock, the Agent shall make available such amounts to
such holders of shares of Everett Common Stock without interest, subject to
and in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

during the last three (3) years formally suspended or debarred or proposed for
suspension or debarment by a U.S. Governmental Authority from participation in

of a Houston Entity or an Everett Entity, or the chief executive officer of a
Houston Entity or an Everett Entity, to commence a specific investigation) to
determine whether credible evidence exists that a Principal, Employee, Agent,

administrative agreement relating directly or indirectly to any Current
Government Contract or Government Bid relating to the Everett Business.

 



 

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 5.12(h)_ of the Everett Disclosure
Schedule, the Houston Entities and Everett Entities are in material compliance
with the terms of all Consent Orders, Deferred Prosecution Agreements, or
similar agreements, and no event has occurred that, individually or in the

with, the Everett Business as heretofore conducted does not conflict with,
infringe upon, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the Intellectual

(iii) to the knowledge of Houston, Houston and its Subsidiaries have taken
reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of all Transferred IP that

confidentiality agreements with Persons with access to such Transferred IP;

 



 

(iv) there is no (A) Action initiated by any other Person pending or, to the
knowledge of Houston, threatened against Houston or any of its Subsidiaries
(1) concerning the matters described in _Section 5.20(a)(ii)_ or (2)

in connection with the conduct of the Everett Business, have implemented and
maintain reasonable and appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery
plans, procedures and facilities, consistent with industry practices of
companies offering similar services to preserve the availability, security,
and integrity of its and their information technology systems, and the data

material respects, with its and their own posted or otherwise binding privacy
policies, relating to privacy, data protection, or the collection, retention,
protection and use of personal information (" **PII** ") collected, used, or
held for use by or on behalf of the Everett Business. No Actions have been
asserted or, to the knowledge of Houston, threatened against Houston or any of
its Subsidiaries, alleging a material violation of any Persons privacy,
personal information or data rights in relation to the conduct of the Everett
Business that would reasonably be expected to have an Everett Material Adverse
Effect. In connection with the operation of the Everett Business, Houston and
its Subsidiaries take commercially reasonable measures to protect PII against
unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse. Except for
disclosures of information required by privacy Laws or authorized by the
provider of PII, or as described in Houston and its Subsidiaries privacy
policies, to the knowledge of Houston, neither Houston nor any of its
Subsidiaries has shared, sold, rented or otherwise made available, and does
not share, sell, rent or otherwise make available, to third parties any PII in
connection with the conduct of the Everett Business.

 



 

(d) Each IP License is valid and binding on Houston and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and, to the knowledge of Houston, the counterparty thereto, and is
in full force and effect, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
applicable Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and
subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). Neither Houston nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in material breach of, or material default under, any IP
License to which it is a party.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 5.4_, _Section 5.22_,
_Section 5.27_ and this _Section 5.20_ are the only representations and
warranties being made by Houston in this Agreement with respect to the
validity of, the right to register, or any activity that constitutes
infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation of, a third
partys Intellectual Property rights.

Everett set forth in _Section 4_ and _Section 5_, no Consent of, with or to

 **6.8** **Chicago Reports and Financial Statements**

 



 

(a) Except as set forth on _Section 6.8_ of the Chicago Disclosure Schedule,
Chicago has timely filed all reports and other documents with the SEC required
to be filed or furnished by Chicago since March 31, 2015 (such documents,
together with any current reports filed during such period by Chicago with the
SEC on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and including all reports and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by Chicago after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing, the " **Chicago SEC Documents** "). As of
their respective dates (and if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the Chicago SEC
Documents complied in all material respects, and each other form, report,
Schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed by
Chicago or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time (the " **Additional Chicago SEC Documents** ") will comply in
all material respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and none of such Chicago SEC Documents when
filed contained, or will contain, an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted, or will omit, to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in
the Chicago SEC Documents and the Additional Chicago SEC Documents fairly
present in all material respects, or will fairly present in all material
respects, the financial position of Chicago and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and changes
in cash flows, changes in stockholders equity or other information included
therein for the periods or as of the respective dates then ended, in each case
except as otherwise noted therein and subject, in the case of unaudited
interim statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments. Each of the
financial statements (including the related notes) of Chicago included in the
Chicago SEC Documents and such other financial statements have been or will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, except as otherwise
noted therein. There is no undisclosed material Liability of Chicago and the
Chicago Subsidiaries of a type required to be reflected or reserved for on a
consolidated balance sheet of Chicago and its consolidated Subsidiaries or in
the notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for: (i)
Liabilities reflected or reserved for in the financial statements of Chicago
included in the Chicago SEC Documents or disclosed in the notes thereto; (ii)
Liabilities that have arisen since March 31, 2016, in the ordinary course of
the operation of Chicagos business; (iii) Liabilities arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; or (iv) Liabilities that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not have a Chicago Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) Chicago has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph (e) of Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act. Chicagos disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Chicago in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Chicagos management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or under the Exchange Act (the " **Sarbanes-Oxley Act**
"). Chicagos management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
Chicagos disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Chicago SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on Chicagos managements most recently completed evaluation
of Chicagos internal control over financial reporting prior to the date
hereof, (i) Chicago had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in
the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Chicagos ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) Chicago does not
have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Chicagos internal control
over financial reporting. Chicago is in compliance in all material respects
with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 



 

 **6.9** **Financing**

 



 

(a) Chicago has delivered to Houston true, complete and fully executed copies
of an executed bridge commitment letter (including: (A) all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments to such agreement in effect as of the date
of this Agreement; and (B) any associated fee letter in redacted form, which
redacted information does not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or
contain any conditions precedent to, the funding of the Financing (as defined
below)) (together, the " **Everett Commitment Letter** ") from The Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (or its designated affiliates), Royal Bank of
Canada, Bank of America, N.A. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA. (together with all
additional lenders and financing sources added to the Everett Commitment
Letter or any Alternative Everett Commitment Letter, the " **Lenders** "),
pursuant to which, among other things, the Lenders have committed to Chicago
to provide Chicago with debt financing in an aggregate amount of
$3,055,000,000 (the bank and/or bond financings, together with the bridge loan
commitments, in each case as contemplated by the Everett Commitment Letter,
being referred to as the " **Financing** "). Prior to the date of this
Agreement, (x) the Everett Commitment Letter has not been amended, waived or
modified, and (y) the respective commitments contained in the Everett
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect. Except for the Everett Commitment Letter, there are no side letters
or other contracts, instruments or other commitments, obligations or
arrangements (whether written or oral) related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Everett
Commitment Letter and delivered to Houston prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Everett Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force
and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Chicago and, to the
knowledge of Chicago, the other parties thereto. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred and on the Closing Date, no event shall have
occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Chicago under any term or
condition of the Everett Commitment Letter. Chicago has fully paid any and all
commitment fees, any other fees

 



      
 

 



 

or any other amounts required by the Everett Commitment Letter to be paid on
or before the date of this Agreement and Chicago represents that any other
fees or other amounts that are due under the Everett Commitment Letter or any
related fee letters are, in each case, required to be paid no earlier than the
Closing. The Financing will provide financing sufficient to refinance the full
amount of the Total Everett Debt and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith. Other than as set forth in the Everett Commitment
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing. Chicago has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing
will not be available to Everett immediately prior to the Distribution Date.
The parties hereto agree that it shall not be a condition to the Closing for
Chicago to obtain the Financing or the Alternative Financing.

 



 

(c) Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, (i) Chicago will not be insolvent; (ii)
Chicago will not be left with unreasonably small capital; (iii) Chicago will
not have incurred debts or other Liabilities beyond its ability to pay such
debts or other Liabilities as they mature; and (iv) the capital of Chicago
will not be impaired.

 



 

 **6.10** **Litigation and Proceedings**

 



 

In each case, as of the date hereof, except as set forth on _Section 6.10_ of
the Chicago Disclosure Schedule, (a) there are no Actions pending or, to the
knowledge of Chicago, threatened before or by any Governmental Authority
against Chicago or any Chicago Subsidiary and (b) there is no Law purporting
to enjoin or restrain the execution and delivery by Chicago or Merger Sub of
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents to which Chicago or Merger Sub is
or will be a party at the Effective Time or the consummation by Chicago and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby that, in each
case, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would have a Chicago

Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), since January 1, 2013: (i) Chicago and the
Chicago Subsidiaries, as applicable, have complied in all material respects
with all terms and conditions of each Current Government Contract, including
but not limited to any Corrective Action Plan or Organizational Conflict of
Interest Mitigation Plan; (ii) Chicago and the Chicago Subsidiaries have not
failed to make a required disclosure or materially misrepresented any written
representation, certification or statement made to a U.S. Governmental
Authority; (iii) neither the U.S. Government nor any prime contractor,
subcontractor or other Person has notified Chicago (or any of its
Subsidiaries) in writing that Chicago (or the applicable Subsidiary) has
materially breached or violated any applicable Law or contract term,
condition, provisions, or requirement pertaining to such Current Government
Contract or failed to make a required disclosure or materially misrepresented
any written representation, certification or statement made to a U.S.
Governmental Authority, that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability for the Chicago Entities or adversely and materially affect
(A) the collectability of any receivable or (B) the award of Government
Contracts in the future; and (iv) no termination for default has been issued
or threatened, and no cure notice or show cause notice under the FAR has been
issued in writing and remains unresolved (and is currently in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) to any Current Government Contract, and, to Chicagos
knowledge, there is no fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to give
rise to any such action.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Except as would not otherwise be material to Chicago and the Chicago
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and except as set forth in _Section 6.29(d)_
of the Chicago Disclosure Schedule, none of Chicago or the Chicago
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Principals (as defined in FAR
52.209-5) is or has been during the last three (3) years formally suspended or
debarred or proposed for suspension or debarment by a U.S. Governmental
Authority from participation in the award of contracts with any U.S.
Governmental Authority or has been declared ineligible for contracting with
any U.S. Governmental Authority and, to Chicagos knowledge, no event has
occurred that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to result in a suspension or debarment or proposed suspension or debarment.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 6.29(e)_ of the Chicago Disclosure
Schedule, (1) there are no outstanding claims, contract disputes for which the
amount in dispute exceeds $500,000, or requests for equitable adjustment
against Chicago or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority or by
any prime contractor, higher or lower tier subcontractor, vendor or other
third party arising under or relating to any Government Contract and (2) to
the knowledge of Chicago, Chicago and the Chicago Subsidiaries have not taken
any action or received any written notice from a Governmental Authority, and
are not parties to any litigation which would reasonably be expected to give
rise to (i) liability under the False Claims Act, (ii) claims for price
adjustments under the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act or (iii) other written
requests for reductions in the prices of the Current Government Contracts,
including claims based on actual or alleged defective pricing. Excluding
routine indirect rate audits and other routine Defense Contract Audit Agency
audits (in which no material irregularities, material misstatements or
material omissions were identified), within the past three (3) years, there
has not been any material, inspection, survey or examination of records by a
Governmental Authority of Chicago or a Chicago Subsidiary that has identified
any material irregularity, material misstatement or material omission arising
under or relating to any of its Current Government Contracts or Government
Bids, or relating to any of their respective employees or representatives with
respect to such Current Government Contracts or Government Bids, nor, to
Chicagos knowledge, have Chicago or any Chicago Subsidiary received written
or oral notice of any such audit, inspection, survey, examination of records
or investigation that is reasonably likely to result in any material liability
for Chicago and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The cost accounting,
billing, and business systems used by the Chicago entities with respect to
Government Contracts have not been deemed inadequate by any U.S. Governmental
Authority.

Schedule, to the knowledge of Chicago, with respect to any Government
Contract, under which final payment was received by Chicago within three (3)
years prior to the date hereof, Chicago does not have credible evidence that a
Principal, Employee, Agent, or Subcontractor (as such terms are defined by FAR
52.203-13(a)) of Chicago or a Chicago Subsidiary has committed a violation of
federal criminal Law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or
gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation
of the civil False Claims Act or has knowingly failed to disclose to the
Government a significant overpayment on a Government Contract and Chicago has
not conducted during the last three (3) years a formal internal investigation
(as evidenced by the express authorization of the Board (or a committee
thereof) of Chicago or a Chicago Subsidiary, or the chief executive officer of
Chicago or a Chicago Subsidiary, to commence a specific investigation) to
determine whether credible evidence exists that a Principal, Employee,

 



      
 

 



 

Agent, or Subcontractor of Chicago or any Chicago Subsidiary has committed any
such violations relating to the business of Chicago. Neither Chicago nor any
Chicago Subsidiary has been, during the last three (3) years, nor is, as of
the date hereof, a party to any material administrative or civil litigation
involving alleged material false statements, false claims or other violations
of federal Law with respect to any Current Government Contract.

 



 

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 6.29(g)_ of the Chicago Disclosure
Schedule, during the past three (3) years, none of Chicago or any of the
Chicago Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or
employees, has made any disclosures to any Governmental Authority pursuant to
any voluntary disclosure agreement or the FAR mandatory disclosure provisions
or has been or is under indictment, or, to the knowledge of Chicago, civil,
administrative or criminal investigation involving a Current Government
Contract or Government Bid relating to the Chicago Business, including, but
not limited, to any allegations of defective performance or work product,
mischarging, factual misstatement, failure to act or other material omission
or alleged irregularity. Within the past three (3) years, none of Chicago or
the Chicago Subsidiaries has entered into any consent order or administrative
agreement relating directly or indirectly to any Current Government Contract
or Government Bid relating to the Chicago Business.

 



 

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 6.29(h)_ of the Chicago Disclosure
Schedule, the Chicago Entities are in material compliance with the terms of
all Consent Orders, Deferred Prosecution Agreements, or similar agreements,
and no event has occurred that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause a material breach in any of these agreements.

 



 

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 6.29(i)_ of the Chicago Disclosure
Schedule, Chicago has in the past three (3) years received a rating of
satisfactory or better and complied in all material respects with all
applicable requirements relating to the safeguarding of and access to
classified information, including those specified in the NISPOM. No notice of
revocation, suspension or invalidation from the Defense Security Service or
any other Governmental Authority has been issued as of the date hereof and
remains unresolved with respect to any such facility security clearance and,
to the knowledge of Chicago, no event, condition or omission has occurred or
exists that would constitute grounds for such action or notice.

 



 

 **6.30** **No Other Representations and Warranties**

 



 

Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 6_, neither Chicago nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives has made, or is
making, any representation or warranty whatsoever to Houston, Everett or any
of their respective Affiliates, and no such party shall be liable in respect
of the accuracy or completeness of any information provided to Houston,
Everett or their respective Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Houston and Everett acknowledges that no representations or
warranties are made with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates or
budgets with respect to Chicago or any of the Chicago Subsidiaries that may

other materials (including any such materials contained in the Chicago
Datasite or otherwise reviewed by Houston, Everett or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement) or
management presentations that have been or shall hereafter be provided to
Houston, Everett or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives are
not and will not be deemed to be representations or warranties of Chicago or
Merger Sub, and no representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy or
completeness of any of the foregoing except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

 **7.3** **Tax Matters**

 



 

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury Regulations and the Parties
hereby adopt it as such. From and after the date of this Agreement and until
the Effective Time, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
the Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions and shall not knowingly take
any action, cause or permit any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could
prevent the Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions. Following the
Effective Time, none of Houston, Chicago or any of their Affiliates shall
knowingly take any action, cause or permit any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or
failure to act could prevent the Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Chicago and Houston shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable
best efforts in order for:

 



 

(i) Chicago to obtain the opinion of a Chicago Tax Co-Counsel, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Chicago, dated as of the Closing Date, on
the basis of the facts and customary representations and assumptions set forth
or referred to in such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters and on the
assumption that the conclusion in clause (ii)(A) of this _Section 7.3(b)_ is
correct, to the effect that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (A) the
Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, and no income, gain or loss will be recognized by any of Chicago,
Merger Sub, Everett or the holders of Everett Common Stock as a result of the
Merger (except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Chicago Common Stock); and (B) the Merger should not cause Section
355(e) of the Code to apply to the Chicago Distribution or otherwise affect
the qualification of the Chicago Distribution as a tax-free distribution under
Section 355 of the Code (such opinion of such Chicago Tax Co-Counsel, the "
**Chicago Tax Opinion** "); and

 



 

(ii) Houston to obtain the opinion of Houston Tax Counsel, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Houston, dated as of the Closing Date, on
the basis of the facts and customary representations and assumptions set forth
or referred to in such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters, as to the
Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions, including that, for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, (A) the Contribution, taken together with the
Distribution, will qualify as a "reorganization" under Sections 368(a), 361
and 355 of the Code; (B) no income, gain or loss will be recognized by
Houston, Everett or the holders of Houston Common Stock as a result of the
Separation (except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Everett Common Stock, if any), including in connection with the
receipt of the Everett Debt by Houston pursuant to the Separation and
Distribution Agreement and the exchange of the Everett Debt for outstanding
debt of Houston (the " **Debt Exchange** "); and (B) the Merger will qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and no
income, gain or loss will be recognized by Everett or the holders of Everett
Common Stock as a result of the Merger (except with respect to the receipt of
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Chicago Common Stock) (such opinion of
Houston Tax Counsel, the " **Houston Tax Opinion** ").

 



 

(iii) As a condition precedent to the rendering of the Chicago Tax Opinion and
the Houston Tax Opinion, Chicago, Houston and Everett, and others, if
required, shall, as of the Closing Date, execute and deliver to Houston Tax
Counsel and Chicago Tax Co-Counsel the Tax Representation Letters. Chicago,
Houston and Everett, and others, if required, shall, as of the date for filing
the Chicago Registration Statement, execute and deliver to Houston Tax Counsel
and Chicago Tax Co-Counsel the Tax Representation Letters, dated and executed
as of the applicable filing date.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, neither Houston nor Everett knows of any reason why
Houston (i) would not be able to deliver the Tax Representation Letters at the
applicable times set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_ or (ii) would not be able to
obtain the Houston Tax Opinion as contemplated by _Section 8.2(d)_.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) As of the date hereof, Chicago does not know of any reason why it (i)
would not be able to deliver the Tax Representation Letters at the applicable
times set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_ or (ii) would not be able to obtain the
Chicago Tax Opinion as contemplated by _Section 8.3(e)_.

 



 

(e) Houston (i) as of the date of this Agreement, does not know and has no
reason to believe, that any Everett Common Stock to be exchanged for Chicago
Common Stock may not be Qualified Everett Common Stock; (ii) will use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent any Everett Common Stock to be exchanged
for Chicago Common Stock from not being Qualified Everett Common Stock; and
(iii) will promptly notify Chicago if, before the Effective Time, it knows or
has reason to believe that any Everett Common Stock to be exchanged for

 **7.4** **Preparation of the Registration Statements, Proxy Statement and
Schedule TO; Chicago Shareholders Meeting**

 



 

(a) _Registration Statements; Proxy Statement; Schedule TO_. As promptly as
practicable after the delivery by Houston of the Audited Financial Statements,
to the extent such filings are required by Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (i) Chicago, Houston and Everett
shall jointly prepare and Chicago shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement
to be sent to the shareholders of Chicago relating to the Chicago Shareholders
Meeting and the Chicago Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement
will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under
the Securities Act of the shares of Chicago Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger; (ii) Chicago, Houston and Everett shall jointly prepare and Houston
shall file with the SEC the Everett Registration Statement; and (iii) if the
Distribution is effected in whole or in part as an exchange offer, Houston
shall prepare and file with the SEC, when and as required, a Schedule TO and
other filings pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act (collectively, the
" **Schedule TO** ").

 



 

(b) Each of Chicago, Houston and Everett shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Chicago Registration Statement and the Everett Registration
Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable after such filing
(including by responding to comments of the SEC) and, prior to the effective
date of the Chicago Registration Statement and the Everett Registration
Statement, each of Chicago, Houston and Everett shall take all action
reasonably required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction
in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of
process in any such jurisdiction) to be taken under any applicable securities
Laws in connection with the issuance of Chicago Common Stock and the
Distribution. As promptly as practicable after the Everett Registration
Statement shall have become effective, Houston shall cause the Distribution
Documents to be mailed to Houstons shareholders. As promptly as practicable
after the Chicago Registration Statement shall have become effective, Chicago
shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Chicago Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement will be made by Chicago without providing Everett with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and such comments shall
be reasonably considered by Chicago). No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Everett Registration Statement or the Schedule TO, if applicable, will
be made by Houston or Everett without providing Chicago with a reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

opportunity to review and comment thereon (and such comments shall be
reasonably considered by Houston).

 



 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Chicago, Houston or Everett, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors
or officers, should be discovered by Chicago, Houston or Everett which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Chicago Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement, the Everett Registration Statement or the
Schedule TO, so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of Chicago. Each party shall
notify the other party promptly of the time when the Chicago Registration
Statement or the Everett Registration Statement has become effective, and of
the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the
shares of Chicago Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger or
shares of Everett Common Stock issuable in the Distribution for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction. In addition, each party agrees to provide the other
party and their respective counsel with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform the other party of any oral comments, that such party or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Chicago Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, the Everett
Registration Statement or the Schedule TO promptly after receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Each party and their
respective counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and each party shall give due consideration to the
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other party and their
respective counsel.

 



 

(d) _Chicago Shareholders Meeting_.

 



 

(i) Subject in all respects to _Section 7.4(d)(iii)_, Chicago shall establish
a record date for, and, as soon as practicable following the effectiveness of
the Chicago Registration Statement, duly call and give notice of and convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " **Chicago Shareholders Meeting**
") for the purpose of seeking the Chicago Shareholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Chicago may, after consultation with Houston, and, in the
case of clause (C) below upon the reasonable request of Houston shall,
postpone or adjourn the Chicago Shareholders Meeting (A) if a quorum has not
been established; (B) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Chicago Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by Chicagos shareholders prior to the Chicago
Shareholders Meeting; (C) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies, if and to the extent the requisite Chicago Shareholder
Approval would not otherwise be obtained; or (D) if required by Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Chicago Shareholders Meeting shall not be
postponed or adjourned for more than ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate
from the originally scheduled date of the Chicago Shareholders Meeting unless
requested by Houston, but in no event shall such meeting be postponed or
adjourned for more than the earlier of fifteen (15) Business Days in the
aggregate from the originally scheduled date of the Chicago Shareholders
Meeting and the last eligible date prior to having to establish a new record
date for such meeting. In addition,

 



      
 

 



 

Chicago may postpone or adjourn the Chicago Shareholders Meeting with the
prior written consent of Houston. Chicago shall advise Houston on a daily
basis during each of the last five (5) Business Days prior to the date of the
Chicago Shareholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by
Chicago with respect to the Chicago Shareholder Approval and at additional
times upon the reasonable request of Houston.

 



 

(ii) Chicago shall, through the Chicago Board, make the Chicago Recommendation
and include such Chicago Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (subject to
_Section 7.10_) and use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit from its
shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Chicago Share Issuance,
and (B) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Chicago
Shareholder Approval. Except as expressly permitted in _Section 7.10(b)_,
neither the Chicago Board nor any committee thereof shall (w) withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify
or qualify, in a manner adverse to Houston or Everett, the approval,
determination of advisability, or recommendation by the Chicago Board of, the
Chicago Share Issuance, (x) make, or permit any director or executive officer
to make, any public statement in connection with the Chicago Shareholders
Meeting by or on behalf of the Chicago Board or such committee that would
reasonably be expected to have the same effect, (y) approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, any Competing Proposal or (z) enter into or permit or
authorize Chicago or any Affiliate of Chicago to enter into any Contract with
respect to a Competing Proposal (the actions specified in the foregoing
clauses (w), (x) and (y) being referred to as a " **Chicago Adverse
Recommendation Change** " and (z) an " **Adverse Acquisition Agreement** ").

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any Chicago Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the
parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Chicago Share Issuance shall be submitted to
the shareholders of Chicago for approval at the Chicago Shareholders Meeting
whether or not (x) the Chicago Board shall have effected a Chicago Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) any Competing Proposal shall have been publicly
proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to Chicago or any of its
Representatives.

 



 

 **7.5** **Listing**

 



 

As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, Chicago shall make
application to the NYSE for the listing of the shares of Chicago Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
use all reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

 



 

 **7.6** **Reasonable Best Efforts**

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after

 



      
 

 



 

the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable
all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions and
filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents set forth in
_Section 4.4_ of the Everett Disclosure Schedule, _Section 5.5_ of the
Everett Disclosure Schedule and _Section 6.5_ of the Chicago Disclosure
Schedule that are required to be obtained or made at or prior to the Effective
Time and all other material consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " **Approvals**
"), (ii) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain all
Approvals (including Chicago providing a guarantee of Everetts obligations as
reasonably necessary to obtain such Approvals), (iii) taking reasonable
efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ in a manner so as to preserve the
applicable privilege and (iv) take the actions set forth in Section 7.6(a) of
the Everett Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that, with respect to Approvals
from third parties (other than Governmental Authorities) required under
existing Contracts, such efforts shall not include any requirement or
obligation of any Party to make any payment to any such third party or assume
any Liability not otherwise required to be paid or assumed by the applicable
party pursuant to the terms of an existing Contract or offer or grant any
financial accommodation or other benefit to such third party not otherwise
required to be made by the applicable party pursuant to the terms of an
existing Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
7.6_, materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning valuation. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make (A) an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof, (B) appropriate
filings, if any are required, with foreign regulatory authorities in
accordance with other applicable Competition Laws, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and (C) all other
necessary filings with other Governmental Authorities relating to the Merger,
and, in each case, to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to such
applicable Laws or by such authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and the receipt of the Approvals under such other applicable Laws
or from such authorities as soon as practicable. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, each of Chicago and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and Houston and Everett, on the other hand, shall, in connection with
the efforts referenced in this _Section 7.6_ to obtain all Approvals, use its
reasonable best efforts to (x) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (y) promptly inform the other party of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " **DOJ** "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " **FTC** ") or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby (and
in each case, if any such communication is in writing, share a copy with the
other party) and (z) permit the other party to review in advance any
communication to be given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or material telephone

 



      
 

 



 

call with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 



 

(b) Without limiting this _Section 7.6_, but subject to the next sentence of
this _Section 7.6(b)_, each Party will take, or to cause to be taken, any and
all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or
trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to, and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of Everett
(or the Everett Subsidiaries) or Chicago (or the Chicago Subsidiaries), as
applicable, or otherwise taking or committing to take action that limits
Everetts or the Everett Subsidiaries or Chicagos or the Chicago
Subsidiaries, as applicable, freedom of action with respect to, or their
ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Everett
(or the Everett Subsidiaries) or Chicago (or the Chicago Subsidiaries) in each
case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
the Closing; _provided_ that, the effectiveness of any such sale, divestiture,
license or disposition or action or commitment shall be contingent on
consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of
this _Section 7.6(b)_ (i) shall not apply to each of the Parties if
compliance with this _Section 7.6(b)_ would be materially adverse to the
business, financial condition or results of operations of Chicago and the
Chicago Subsidiaries (including, for purposes of this sentence, Everett and
the Everett Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) and (ii) for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not require Houston to agree to any sale, divestiture, licensing
or disposition of any assets or businesses, or restriction or change in the
ownership, conduct or operations of any assets or businesses, that are not
included in the Everett Business.

 



 

 **7.7** **Financing**

 



 

(a) Chicago shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange as promptly as reasonably practicable and to consummate
the Financing concurrent with or prior to the Closing on terms and conditions
no less favorable in the aggregate than the terms and conditions described in
the Everett Commitment Letter. Chicago shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, (i) use reasonable best efforts to comply with and maintain the Everett
Commitment Letter and negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect
thereto, on the terms and conditions contained therein, which terms and
conditions shall not expand upon the conditions to Closing or other
contingencies to the funding on the closing date of the Financing as set forth
in the Everett Commitment Letter (the " **Financing Agreements** ") and shall
deliver to Houston a copy thereof as promptly as practicable (and no later
than one (1) Business Day after such execution); (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions in the Everett Commitment Letter and the Financing
Agreements that are within its control; (iii) fully enforce its rights under
the Everett Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements, including, at the
request of Houston, by commencing litigation proceedings against the Lenders;
and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to draw upon and consummate the Financing
at or prior to the Distribution. In the event any funds in the amounts

 



      
 

 



 

set forth in the Everett Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Everett Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, or it becomes
reasonably likely that such funds may become unavailable on the terms and
conditions set forth therein, Chicago shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain promptly any such portion
from alternative sources, including, subject to _Section 7.7(b)_, on terms
that shall not expand the conditions or other contingencies to the funding,
from those set forth in the Everett Commitment Letter, in an amount
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is available, to
refinance the Total Everett Debt (the " **Alternative Financing** ") and to
obtain, and, when obtained, to provide promptly to Houston a copy of, a new
financing commitment that provides for financing in an amount that is
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is available, to
refinance the Total Everett Debt (the " **Alternative Everett Commitment
Letter** "). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing or the Alternative
Financing, as applicable, is available and all conditions to Closing set forth
in _Section 8_ have been satisfied or waived or will be satisfied or waived
at the Closing, Chicago shall take all actions necessary to allow Chicago to
incur the indebtedness provided under the Financing or the Alternative
Financing, as applicable.

 



 

(b) To the extent applicable, Chicago shall take (or cause to be taken) all
actions necessary, proper or advisable in order to arrange as promptly as
reasonably practicable and to consummate the Alternative Financing concurrent
with or prior to the Closing on the terms and conditions described in the
Alternative Everett Commitment Letter, which actions shall include (i) using
reasonable best efforts to comply with and maintain the Alternative Everett
Commitment Letter and negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein, which terms and
conditions shall not expand upon the conditions to Closing or other
contingencies to the funding on the closing date of the Alternative Financing
as set forth in the Alternative Everett Commitment Letter (the " **Alternative
Financing Agreements** ") and shall deliver to Houston a copy of such
definitive agreements as promptly as practicable (and no later than one (1)
Business Day after such execution); (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions in the Alternative Financing Agreements within its control; (iii)
fully enforce its rights under the Alternative Everett Commitment Letter and
the Alternative Financing Agreements including, at the request of Houston, by
commencing litigation proceedings against the Lenders; and (iv) using
reasonable best efforts to draw upon and consummate the Alternative Financing
concurrent with or prior to the Closing. Neither the Alternative Everett
Commitment Letter nor the Alternative Financing Agreements shall (A) expand
upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the closing
date of the Financing as set forth in the Everett Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement or the Financing Agreements; or (B)
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Chicago
shall give Houston prompt written notice (v) of any material breach (or
threatened material breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the Everett
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the
Alternative Everett Commitment Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements;
(w) of any actual or threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the
Financing by any of the Lenders; (x) of any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any of the parties to the Everett Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the Alternative

 



      
 

 



 

Everett Commitment Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements; (y) of any
amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Everett Commitment Letter
or the Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the Alternative Everett
Commitment Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements or any related fee
letters; or (z) if for any reason Chicago believes in good faith that it will
not be able to timely obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
and in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Everett Commitment
Letter or the Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the Alternative Everett
Commitment Letter or the Alternative Financing Agreements. Chicago shall keep
Houston informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Financing and, if
applicable, the Alternative Financing, including by providing copies of then-
current drafts of the Financing Agreements as reasonably requested from time
to time and providing copies of all definitive agreements. Chicago shall not,
without the prior written consent of Houston, amend, modify, supplement,
restate, substitute, replace, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under
the Everett Commitment Letter, any Alternative Everett Commitment Letter, any
Financing Agreement or any Alternative Financing Agreement in a manner that
expands on the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the
closing date of the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing, as
set forth in such agreements or that could otherwise prevent, impair or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; _provided_ , that additional
lenders and financing sources may be added to the Everett Commitment Letter or
any Alternative Everett Commitment Letter after the date hereof or thereof
with a concomitant reduction in the commitment of the lenders party thereto on
the date hereof or thereof.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Houston shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives (and use reasonable best efforts to cause external auditors)
to provide, at the sole expense of Chicago, all reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Chicago and that is customary in connection with efforts to
obtain financing of the type of the Financing or, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing ( _provided_ , that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Everett Business),
including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, rating agency and
roadshow presentations and due diligence sessions; (ii) furnishing Chicago and
its financing sources with (A) pertinent information regarding the Everett
Business as is customary in connection with the Financing or, if applicable,
the Alternative Financing and (B) with respect to the Everett Business, the
following financial statements and other information: (w) financial
statements, MDandA, business and other financial data of the type required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and customarily
included in offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents, to consummate a Rule 144A offering of debt securities; (x)
financial information of the Everett Business, based on the fiscal years ended
October 31, 2015 and October 31, 2016, necessary for Chicago to prepare an
unaudited condensed combined pro forma balance sheet and related unaudited
condensed combined pro forma statement of income for the 12-month period
ending October 31, 2016 and the nine-month period ending July 31, 2016 and for
such other periods as is required by Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act, prepared after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Financing
Agreements to be consummated on the Closing Date as if such transactions had
occurred as of such date (in the case of such balance sheet) or at the
beginning of such period (in the case of such income statements), which need
not

 



      
 

 



 

include adjustments for purchase accounting (including adjustments of the type
contemplated by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification 805, Business Combinations (formerly SFAS 141R)); (y) unaudited
pre-tax consolidated balance sheets and related combined unaudited pre-tax
statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Everett
Business for each fiscal quarter ended between October 31, 2015 and October
31, 2016; if the Effective Time shall not have occurred prior to the time that
audited financial statements of the Everett Business are required to be filed
with the SEC, audited financial statements of the Everett Business for the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 prepared in accordance with the Audited
Financial Statements and (z) a reconciliation of the combined EBITDA of the
Everett Business for fiscal year 2015 with the audited combined income
statement of the Everett Business for such period (collectively, the "
**Required Financial Statements** ") and such other financial information as
may be reasonably requested by Chicago in order to consummate the Financing
or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing; (iii) assisting Chicago and its

information memoranda and bank syndication materials and similar documents
required in connection with the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternative

of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Chicago that are necessary to
permit the consummation of the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternative
Financing; (v) providing customary authorization and management representation
letters representing (without knowledge or any similar qualifier) that the
information provided by Houston for inclusion in any confidential information
memorandum or lender presentation does not include material non-public
information about Houston and its Subsidiaries, and designating the
information provided by Houston for presentation to the Lenders as suitable to

thereunder and hereunder and that nothing in this _Section 7.8_ shall require
Houston to provide access to any of its businesses or any information other
than with respect to the Everett Business. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement. All requests for such access to any
Party shall be made to such Party or its designated Representative. Everett
will make available to Chicago prior to the Closing true and complete copies
of the Organizational Documents of the Everett Subsidiaries.

 



 

 **7.9** **D andO Indemnification and Insurance**

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Chicago agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of
any Everett Entity against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that Houston or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Everett Entities), as the case may be, would have been
permitted under the Organizational Documents of Everett in effect on the date
hereof to indemnify such Person (including promptly advancing expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under such Organizational Documents).
Without limiting the foregoing, Chicago shall cause the Everett Entities (i)
to maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective
Time provisions in their respective Organizational Documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Everett Entities respective former and current officers,
directors, employees and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons
than the provisions of the Organizational Documents of Houston or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Everett Entities), as applicable, in each case, as
of the date hereof and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law.

 



 

(b) Chicago shall procure (i) a prepaid, non-cancelable six (6)-year "tail"
policy commencing on the Closing Date containing terms not less favorable than
the terms of directors and officers liability insurance covering those
Persons who are currently covered by the directors and officers liability
insurance policies of Houston or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Everett Entities) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time or (ii) an endorsement under Chicagos existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy to provide such coverage. If any claim is
asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, then any insurance required
to be maintained under this _Section 7.9_ shall be continued in respect of
such claim until the final disposition thereof.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 7.9_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and
assigns of Chicago and Everett and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each present and former director, officer and employee
of any Everett Entity and his or her heirs and representatives. In the event
that Chicago or Everett or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Chicago or Everett, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.9_.

 



 

 **7.10** **No Solicitation**

 



 

(a) Chicago shall immediately cease, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations with any
Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Competing Proposal, or any
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal,
and shall request to have returned promptly any confidential information that
has been provided in any such discussions or negotiations. From the date
hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9_, Chicago shall not, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information which has not been previously publicly disseminated)
any Competing Proposal or any proposal which would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Competing Proposal, or (ii) engage in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(x) Chicago may ascertain facts from the Person making an unsolicited
Competing Proposal for the sole purpose of the Chicago Board informing itself
about the terms of such Competing Proposal and the Person that made it and (y)
if, prior to obtaining the Chicago Shareholder Approval and following the
receipt of a bona fide written Competing Proposal made after the date hereof
that the Chicago Board determines in good faith (after receiving advice of its
financial advisor and of its outside legal counsel) is or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that was not, directly or
indirectly, solicited, initiated or encouraged in violation of this _Section
7.10_, the Chicago Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that a failure to take action with respect to such
Competing Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, Chicago may, in response to such Competing Proposal and
subject to compliance with _Section 7.10(c)_, (A) furnish information with
respect to Chicago to the Person making such Competing Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person regarding such Competing Proposal; _provided_ ,
that Chicago may only take the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A)
and (B) if it has provided Houston and Everett with notice of its intent to
take such action at least one (1) Business Day prior to taking the first of
any such actions. Except as expressly permitted by this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 7.10_, Chicago shall not, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, from and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on
which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9_, directly or
indirectly (1) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or publicly propose
to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal; (2) take any action to make
the provisions of any takeover statute inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by a Competing Proposal; (3) terminate, amend, release, modify or
knowingly fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or
request under, any standstill or similar agreement entered into by the
applicable party in respect of or in contemplation of a Competing Proposal
(other than to the extent (I) the Chicago Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take any of such
actions under clause (3) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (II) Chicago releases Houston of any comparable standstill
or similar obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement); or (4) propose to
do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) In addition to the provisions of _Section 7.10(a)_, prior to receipt of
the Chicago Shareholder Approval, the Chicago Board may (I) in response to any
bona fide written Competing Proposal that was not, directly or indirectly,
solicited, initiated or encouraged in violation of this _Section 7.10_,
effect a Chicago Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(i)_ solely in order to concurrently enter into an
Adverse Acquisition Agreement, or both, or (II) in response to an Intervening
Event, effect a Chicago Adverse Recommendation Change, in the case of each of
clauses (I) and (II), if and only if (i) (A) in the case of a Competing
Proposal, the Chicago Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
Chicagos outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an
Intervening Event, if the Chicago Board (x) determines in good faith that an
Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (y) concludes in good
faith, after consultation with Chicagos outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii)
the Chicago Board provides Houston and Everett four (4) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (an " **Alternative
Notice** "), which notice shall include the information with respect to such
Competing Proposal that is specified in _Section 7.10(c)_ as well as a copy
of such Competing Proposal, or the facts and circumstances relating to any
such Intervening Event, as applicable (it being agreed that neither the
delivery of such notice by Chicago nor any public announcement thereof that
Chicago determines it is required to make under applicable Law shall
constitute a Chicago Adverse Recommendation Change unless and until Chicago
shall have failed at or prior to the end of the period referred to in clause
(iii) below (and, upon the occurrence of such failure, such notice and such
public announcement shall constitute a Chicago Adverse Recommendation Change)
to publicly announce that it (A) is recommending the Chicago Share Issuance
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) in the case of a
Competing Proposal, has determined that such Competing Proposal (taking into
account (x) any modifications or adjustments made to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement agreed to by the other party in writing and (y)
any modifications or adjustments made to such other Competing Proposal) is not
a Superior Proposal and has publicly rejected such Competing Proposal); (iii)
during the four (4) Business Days following such written notice (the "
**Negotiation Period** "), if

 



      
 

 



 

requested by Houston or Everett, the Chicago Board and its Representatives
have negotiated in good faith with Houston and Everett regarding any revisions
to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by
Houston or Everett in response to such Competing Proposal or Intervening
Event; and (iv) at the end of the four (4) Business Day period described in
the foregoing clause (iii), the Chicago Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with Chicagos outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and
taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement to which Houston and Everett have agreed in writing), that any
Competing Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and, after consultation
with Chicagos outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Chicago
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Competing Proposal or
Intervening Event or to terminate this Agreement in order to concurrently
enter into an Adverse Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with the
exercise by the Chicago Board of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Any material amendment or modification to any Competing Proposal or to the
facts and circumstances relating to any Intervening Event shall require a new
Alternative Notice and a new Negotiation Period commencing from the date of
receipt of such new Alternative Notice; _provided_ , that with respect to each
subsequent written notice related to a material amendment or modification,
references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be
references to two (2) Business Days.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations set forth in _Section 7.10(a)_ and
_Section 7.10(b)_, Chicago shall promptly, and in any event no later than
twenty-four (24) hours, after it receives (i) any Competing Proposal or
written indication by any Person that it is considering making a Competing
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to Chicago or
its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and unrelated to a Competing Proposal
or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Competing Proposal, notify Houston in writing of any of the foregoing
occurrences, the identity of the Person making such request, inquiry or
Competing Proposal and a copy of such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal
(or where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of such
request, inquiry or Competing Proposal), including any modifications thereto.
Chicago shall keep Houston and Everett reasonably informed on a current basis
(and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence of
any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status
of any request, inquiry or Competing Proposal (including the terms and
conditions thereof and of any modification thereto), and any material
developments, discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies of any
written inquiries, material correspondence and draft documentation, and
written summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Chicago
agrees that, subject to applicable restrictions under applicable Law, it
shall, prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
any third parties, provide to Houston and Everett any non-public information
concerning Chicago or its Subsidiaries that Chicago provided to any third
party in connection with any Competing Proposal which was not previously
provided to Houston and Everett.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Chicago Board from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated
by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Chicago Adverse
Recommendation Change so long as any such disclosure (i) includes the

 



      
 

 



 

Chicago Recommendation, without any alteration, modification or qualification
thereof and (ii) does not effect a Chicago Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(e) Any failure of Chicagos Subsidiaries or their Representatives to comply
with this _Section 7.10_ (as if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were
directly subject to this _Section 7.10_) shall be deemed a breach of this
_Section 7.10_ by Chicago.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Competing Proposal** " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any proposal or offer from a third party
relating to (A) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving Chicago; (B) the
acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint
venture or otherwise) by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets of Chicago and the Chicago Subsidiaries, as determined on
a book-value or fair-market-value basis; (C) the purchase or acquisition after
the date hereof, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any Person of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Chicago Common Stock or any other Interests in Chicago; (D) any purchase,
acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result
in any Person beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the shares
of Chicago Common Stock or any other Interests of Chicago or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (E) any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) " **Superior Proposal** " means a bona fide written Competing Proposal
(except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%") made by a
third party which was not solicited by Chicago or any of its Representatives
in violation of _Section 7.10(a)_ and which, in the good faith judgment of
the Chicago Board after consultation with its outside financial and legal
advisors, taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the Competing Proposal, (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
consummated on a timely basis and (B) if consummated, would result in a
transaction that is more favorable to Chicagos shareholders from a financial
point of view, than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and after giving effect to all adjustments or modifications to the terms
thereof which may be agreed in writing to be made by Houston (including
pursuant to _Section 7.10(b)_).

 



 

 **7.11** **Public Announcements**

 



 

The Parties agree that, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, no

of the other Parties, except that (a) any Party may make announcements from
time to time in one or more filings of a current report filed with the SEC on
Form 8-K that announces the execution and delivery of this Agreement or as may
be required by applicable Law or any securities exchange on which the
securities of any Party is listed (and the Parties shall provide the other
with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such filings prior to
making such filings), and (b) each Party may make announcements from time to
time to their respective employees, customers, owners, suppliers and other
business relations and otherwise as such Party may reasonably determine is
necessary to comply with the

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of any agreement to which such Party is a party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Parties shall cooperate to prepare press releases to be
issued on or promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after
the date hereof and press releases to be issued on the Closing Date. The
Parties agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the
extent and to the Persons to whom disclosure is required by applicable Law or
for purposes of compliance with financial reporting obligations; _provided_ ,
that the Parties may disclose such terms to their respective Representatives,
in each case, as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their
respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree to, or are bound by
Contract or professional or fiduciary obligations to, keep the terms of this
Agreement confidential and so long as each Party shall be responsible to the
other Parties for breach of this _Section 7.11_ or such confidentiality
obligations by the recipients of its disclosure).

 



 

 **7.12** **Defense of Litigation**

 



 

Chicago shall keep Houston apprised in the defense of any Action brought by
shareholders of Chicago or in the name of Chicago against Chicago and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger; _provided_ , that prior to the Effective Time, Chicago
shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Action arising or
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or consent to
the same, without the prior written consent of Houston (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent (a) such Action includes
Houston or any of its Subsidiaries, directors or officers as named defendants
or (b) such compromise, settlement or arrangement would reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Parties to perform
their respective obligations hereunder, or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby in a timely manner.

 



 

 **7.13** **Section 16 Matters**

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, Chicago and Everett shall take all such steps as
may be required to cause any dispositions of Everett Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Everett Common Stock) or acquisitions of
Chicago Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Chicago
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Chicago or Everett to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in
accordance with applicable SEC rules and regulations and interpretations of
the SEC staff.

 



 

 **7.14** **Control of Other Party s Business**

 



 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Houston or Everett, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct Chicagos operations prior to the
Effective Time. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Chicago,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the

 **7.15** **Everett Share Issuance**

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, Everett will take all actions necessary to
authorize the issuance of a number of shares of Everett Common Stock such that
the total number of shares of Everett Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will equal the number of shares of Houston Common
Stock entitled to receive the Distribution outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Separation and
Distribution Agreement. Each of Houston and Everett shall effect such
amendments, filings or other actions with respect to its respective
Organizational Documents as are necessary to effect the Distribution in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **7.16** **Exchange Offer**

 



 

Prior to consummation of, and as a condition to the closing of, the Exchange
Offer, Houston shall provide Chicago with evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Chicago that the condition described in _Section 7.16_ of the Chicago
Disclosure Schedule has been satisfied. If Houston consummates the Exchange
Offer and Houstons shareholders subscribe for less than all of the Everett
Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, Houston shall distribute, _pro rata_ to
its shareholders, any unsubscribed Everett Common Stock on the Distribution
Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer so that
Houston will be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having
distributed all of the Everett Common Stock to its shareholders.

 



 

 **7.17** **Takeover Statutes**

 



 

If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other form
of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, Chicago and Merger Sub and their respective

October 31, 2015 (collectively, the " **Audited Financial Statements** ").

 



 

(b) Following the delivery of the Audited Financial Statements, Houston will
prepare and furnish to Chicago, as promptly as practicable after the end of

subject in the case of unaudited financial statements to normal year-end
adjustments and the absence of

 



      
 

 



 

footnotes; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that the audited combined
balance sheet of the Everett Business as of October 31, 2016, and the combined
statements of income, equity and cash flows of the Everett Business for the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, will be delivered to Houston no later than

the end of each fiscal quarter the unaudited pre-tax income statement for the
Everett Business for such quarter and the unaudited pre-tax balance sheet as

months after the Effective Time), valid and binding written unconditional
releases of Houston and its Affiliates (other than the Everett Entities), as
applicable, from any Liability, whether arising before, on or after the
Closing Date, under any Support Obligation in effect immediately prior to the

of any discussions with such beneficiaries in which Houston does not
participate.

 



 

(b) Without limiting Chicagos obligations under _Section 7.19(a)_, if any
Support Obligation has not been released as of the Effective Time, then, from
and after the Effective Time, (i) Chicago shall indemnify and hold harmless
Houston and its applicable Affiliates for any Liabilities arising from or
relating to such Support Obligation, including any fees in connection with the
issuance and maintenance of any letters of credit, and (ii) Chicago shall not

Houston or any of its applicable Affiliates has performance obligations under
any Support Obligation after the Effective Time, from and after the Effective
Time, Chicago shall (x) perform (or cause the Everett Entities to perform)
such obligations on behalf of Houston and such Affiliates or (y) otherwise
take such action as reasonably requested by Houston and such Affiliates so as
to put Houston and such Affiliates in the same position as if Chicago, and not
Houston, had performed or were performing such obligations.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Everett shall unconditionally guarantee the
full and punctual payment of principal of, premium, if any and interest on the
EDS Debt when due (subject to any applicable grace period), whether at
maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise. Everett promptly shall
reimburse Houston, or cause Houston to be reimbursed, in full for all amounts
paid by Houston at any time after the Closing (A) under the EDS Debt pursuant
to Houstons guarantee thereof or (B) pursuant to the Guarantee Fee and
Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015, by HP Enterprise
Services, LLC and Houston in favor of Hewlett-Packard Company (the "
**Guarantee Fee and Reimbursement Agreement** "). Commencing upon the Closing,
Houston shall assume Everetts obligation to pay to Hewlett-Packard Company
the guarantee fee and default interest (if applicable) pursuant to Section

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, (i) Houston may, in
its sole discretion, take any action to terminate, obtain release of or
otherwise limit its Liability under any and all outstanding Support
Obligations and (ii) neither Houston nor any of its applicable Affiliates will
have any obligation to renew any guarantees, letters of credit, comfort
letters, bonds, sureties and other credit support or assurances issued on

mass solicitation or advertising that is not targeted at Chicago employees
shall not be considered a violation of the non-solicitation restriction of

its Subsidiaries from soliciting, offering to hire, hiring, or entering into a
consulting agreement with, any employee of Chicago whose employment with

with, any Houston employee whose employment with Houston or any of its

Distribution, cause Everett to distribute to Houston securities representing
indebtedness of Everett in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Above-
Basis Amount and containing terms consistent with those described in paragraph
(b) below (the " _Everett Debt_ "), and (ii) cause the Debt Exchange prior to
the Distribution in a process to be jointly managed by Houston and Chicago in
good faith; _provided_ , that Houston shall have the right to make the final
determination, after good faith consultation with Chicago, on any matters with
respect thereto as to which the parties disagree (including the determination

Chicago and Houston will each be permitted to participate in any material
discussions with the investment banks, managers or other third parties
relating to the terms and conditions of the Everett Debt and to review and
comment on drafts of proposed indentures, specimen security certificates,
purchase agreements and other similar agreements governing the Everett Debt.
Each party hereto shall cooperate in connection with the preparation of all
documents and the making of all filings required in connection with the
issuance of the Everett Debt and the consummation of the Debt Exchange.
Houston and Chicago shall coordinate their activities with respect to the Debt
Exchange and the other components of the Financing or the Alternative
Financing, as applicable, with the intent of optimizing the marketing and
execution thereof.

 



 

(b) The Everett Debt shall (1) have a minimum term of seven years from
issuance, (2) be subject to covenants that are consistent with market practice
for issuers with the

 



      
 

 



 

investment rating assigned to Everett upon consummation of the Merger and, to
the extent commercially practicable, that conform to the covenants in
comparable debt instruments issued by Chicago and (3) include terms that are
designed to cause the security to be considered _pari passu_ with Chicago Debt
upon issuance and to result in the security trading at or near par upon
issuance; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Debt Exchange is unable to be
consummated via the issuance of Everett Debt within the foregoing parameters,
the parties agree that Houston may complete the issuance of the Everett Debt
outside such parameters to the extent necessary to consummate the Debt
Exchange prior to the Distribution, as determined by Houston in good faith,
after reasonable consultation with Chicago.

 



 

(c) If the Debt Exchange is effected by means of an intermediated exchange,
(i) Houston shall be responsible for any tender or consent fees required to
buy back the related Houston indebtedness, and (ii) Chicago shall be
responsible for the payments of any underwriting fees and other costs to issue
the Everett Debt. If the Exchange Offer is effected by means of a direct
exchange, (i) Houston shall be responsible for payments of any tender or
consent fees required to buy back the Houston indebtedness, and (ii) Chicago
shall be responsible for all placement agent fees and other costs of issuance.

 



 

(d) Chicago and Houston will jointly manage the negotiations in connection
with the issuance of the Total Everett Debt and the selection of investment
banking advisors with respect to the Debt Exchange, except that the selection
of active lead dealer manager(s) for a direct exchange, purchaser(s) of
Houston bonds for the tender offer portion of an intermediated exchange and
active lead bookrunners for the bond issuance portion of an intermediated
exchange shall be jointly determined by Houston and Chicago, but in the event
the parties cannot agree, then by Houston after good faith consultation with
Chicago. Such active lead dealer manager(s), purchaser(s) or active lead
bookrunner(s) shall be selected among the original joint-lead arrangers of the
Chicago financing commitment, each a "Lead Dealer Manager" title in the Debt
Exchange, with up to three (3) additional "Lead Dealer Manager" titleage
positions reserved for post-announcement joint-lead arrangers in the
syndication sell-down of Chicago financing commitments and the syndication of
the incremental revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loans
contemplated for the transaction.

 



 

 **7.24** **Non-Competition**

 



 

Chicago hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Everett Entities shall remain
subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7.7 of the Hewlett-Packard
SDA and that such restrictions continue to apply to the Everett Entities
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to the same
extent as such restrictions apply as of the date hereof.

 



 

 **7.25** **IT Support**

 



 

Between June 30 and August 31, 2016, Houston and Chicago shall work together
in good faith using commercially reasonable efforts and an open books
approach, to the extent permitted by Law, to agree upon the material financial
terms and conditions (including with respect to pricing, pricing methodology,
savings, service level and productivity commitments) of a managed services
information technology transaction pursuant to which Chicago will provide
services to Houston over a five year term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time after the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof, at the request of Houston, Chicago will agree to provide required
IT outsourcing services to Houston on a mutually agreed upon, fully
transparent cost plus basis for a mutually agreed period of time.

termination shall relieve any Party of any liability or damages resulting from
Fraud or Willful Breach; _provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section 9.2_ and
_Section 10_ hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **9.3** **Termination Fees; Expenses**

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Separation and Distribution Agreement
or this Agreement, including _Section 9.1(i)_ and this _Section 9.3_, and

Chicago Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement and the Everett
Registration Statement required in connection with the actions specified in
_Section 7.4_, (ii) all SEC filing fees relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) the fees in connection with the
approvals required under _Section 7.6(a) _related to the Merger (each of
which fees and expenses in clauses (i) through (iii) shall be borne, in each
case, equally by Chicago and Houston), all fees and expenses incurred by the
parties shall be borne solely by the party that has incurred such fees and
expenses.

 



 

(b) Chicago shall pay to Houston $160,000,000 (the " **Termination Fee** ") if
this Agreement is terminated as follows:

 



 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ or _Section
9.1(h)_, then Chicago shall pay the entire Termination Fee (to the extent not
previously paid) on the second Business Day following such termination; and

 



 

(ii) (x) if this Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_,
(B) pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or (C) pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ without
a vote of the shareholders of Chicago contemplated by this Agreement at the
Chicago Shareholders Meeting having occurred, and in any such case a Competing
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the
Chicago Board at any time after the date of this Agreement and not publicly
withdrawn at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of the taking of
the vote

 



      
 

 



 

of the shareholders of Chicago contemplated by this Agreement at the Chicago
Shareholders Meeting, in the case of clause (A), or the date of termination,
in the case of clauses (B) and (C), and (y) if within twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, a transaction in respect of a Competing Proposal
is consummated or Chicago enters into a definitive agreement in respect of a
Competing Proposal (which, in each case, need not be the same Competing
Proposal that was made, disclosed or communicated prior to the termination
hereof), then Chicago shall be obligated to pay the Termination Fee (less any
Expenses previously paid to Houston pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_) on the
second Business Day following the earlier of the date Chicago enters into a
definitive agreement in respect or consummates such transaction; _provided_ ,
that, solely for purposes of this _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_, the term "
**Competing Proposal** " shall have the meaning set forth in _Section
7.10(f)(i)_, except that all references to 20% shall be changed to 50%.

 



 

Any Termination Fee or Alternative Termination Fee due under this _Section
9.3(b)_ or _Section 9.1(i)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 



 

(c) Chicago shall pay to Houston its Expenses in an amount not to exceed
$45,000,000 if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_. Any
Expenses of Houston due under this _Section 9.3(c)_ shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds no later than two (2) Business Days
after receipt by Chicago of an itemized statement identifying such Expenses.

 



 

(d) The parties each agree that the agreements contained in _Section 9.1(i)_
and this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Chicago fails to pay any amounts
due under _Section 9.1(i)_ or this _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain
such payment, Houston commences a suit that results in a judgment against
Chicago for such amounts, Chicago shall pay interest on such amounts from the
date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the
rate equal to the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal for the
relevant period, together with the costs and expenses of Houston (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. Payment by
Chicago of the Termination Fee, Alternative Termination Fee or the Houston
Expenses shall not relieve Chicago from any liability or damage resulting from
a Willful Breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, or fraud; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if Houston accepts payment from Chicago of the Termination Fee in
connection with the termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_, none of
Chicago, its Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates, and the former,
current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general
or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Chicago, its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates, shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder (whether or not relating to or arising out
of any material breach of this Agreement, or fraud). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, including _Section 9.3_, shall in
any way limit the provisions of _Section 10.9_.

 



 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Chicago be
required to pay more than one Termination Fee or Alternative Termination Fee.

WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.4(c)_.

 



 

 **10.5** **Assignment; Parties in Interest; Non-Parties**

 



 

(a) No Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement
without the written consent of the other Parties. Any attempted assignment or
delegation in breach of this _Section 10.5_ shall be null and void. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or
implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or
give any Person, other than the Parties, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement, except as provided in _Section 7.9_ and _Section
10.5(b)_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered
thereby and may be enforced by such Persons)

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is hereby
agreed and acknowledged that this Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims of action that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to, this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may
only be made against the parties hereto, and no former,

 



      
 

 



 

current or future Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, employees,
equityholders, lenders, financing sources, managers, members, partners, agents
or representatives of any party, in each case, who is not a party to this
Agreement, shall have any liability for any obligations of the parties hereto
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby. Such Persons who are not parties hereto are third party
beneficiaries of _Section 10.3_, _Section 10.4_, and this _Section
10.5(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.5(b)_ shall not affect
(a) the rights of the Persons party to the Everett Commitment Letter to
enforce the Everett Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms; or (b) the
rights and obligations of the parties hereto set forth in _Section 7.7_.

 



 

 **10.6** **Captions; Counterparts**

 



 

The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by electronic or .pdf transmission), each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. Delivery of any signature page by facsimile,
electronic or .pdf transmission shall be binding to the same extent as an
original signature page.

 



 

 **10.7** **Entire Agreement**

 



 

This Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement,
including any related annexes, Exhibits and Schedules, as well as any other
agreements and documents referred to herein and therein, shall together
constitute the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any other agreements, whether
written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of
the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the express intent of
the parties that the non-solicitation provisions contained in Paragraph 11 of
the Confidentiality Agreement be terminated and replaced by the agreements and
covenants set forth in _Section 7.22_ of this Agreement.

 



 

 **10.8** **Severability**

 



 

If any provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or the
application of any provision to any Person or circumstance, is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
Parties.

 



 

 **10.9** **Specific Performance**

 



 

In the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the
terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, the Party who is, or is to be, thereby aggrieved shall have the
right to specific performance and injunctive or

 



      
 

 



 

other equitable relief in respect of its rights under this Agreement or such
Transaction Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
parties hereto agree that each party shall be entitled to enforce specifically
the other parties obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing and the
obligations with respect to the Financing), if the conditions set forth in
Section 8 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived (where permissible under
applicable Law). The Parties agree that the remedies at law for any breach or
threatened breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for
any loss and that any defense in any Action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing
or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived by each of the Parties to
this Agreement.
