extent any failure to make a Project Report available to Buyer would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the applicable Company or Company
Subsidiary.

 

 

Section 4.07 _Regulatory Status_. Except for the fuel cell energy Projects
listed on _Annex II_ , each Project is a QF and is  eligible for the
exemptions from regulation as set forth in 18 C.F.R. §§ 292.601(c) (including
exemption from FPA Sections 203, 205, and 206), 292.602(b) and 292.602(c). A
QF self-certification filing has been made with respect to each  Project
(other than (a) the fuel cell energy Projects listed on _Annex II_ , and (b)
as of the Effective Date, the Projects listed on _Schedule 4.07_ ) that has a
power production capacity greater than 1 MW applying the method of 
calculation in 18 C.F.R. §292.204; all representations and information in such
self-certification filings were and remain true, correct and complete in all
material respects; and each such self-certification is in full force and
effect. None  of any Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Project is
subject to regulation by any state utility regulatory commission under
applicable Laws as a "utility," "electric utility," "public utility,"
"electric corporation," "public service  company" or similar entity with
respect to its rates and finances, obligations to make utility-related filings
(including tariff filings) or utility-related obligations to the public,
except for any such regulation that would not reasonably  be expected to be
material to the applicable Company, Company Subsidiary or Project. Each fuel
cell energy Project listed in _Annex II_ is interconnected directly to the
offtaker under the fuel cell Project's respective Power Purchase  Agreement,
and each fuel cell energy Project sells its electrical output exclusively at
retail for use solely by the offtaker under such Power Purchase Agreement
(other than through net metering arrangements between the customer and the
local  electric utility as provided in the applicable Power Purchase
Agreement).

Membership Interests may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the
registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, or pursuant to an
applicable exemption therefrom and subject to state securities laws and

financial and business matters so as to  be capable of evaluating the merits
and risk of its investment.

representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article III and Article
IV (including the related portions of the Schedules); and (b) neither of
Seller or the Company nor any other Person has  made any representation or
warranty as to Seller, the Company or this Agreement, except as expressly set
forth in Article III and Article IV (including the related portions of the

its Representatives and counsel reasonable access to and the right to inspect
all of the Real Property, properties, assets, premises, books and records, 
contracts, agreements and other documents and data related to the Companies,
the Company Subsidiaries and the Projects; (b) furnish Buyer and its
Representatives and counsel with such financial, operating and other data and

Projects as Buyer or any of its Representatives and counsel may reasonably
request; and (c) instruct the Representatives and counsel of Sellers and the
Companies to cooperate with  Buyer in its investigation of the Companies, the
Company Subsidiaries and the Projects; provided, however, that any such

of  (A) a Seller, any Company, any Project or any customer of a Seller or any
Company or (B) Sellers' or their Affiliate's execution of their respective
obligations hereunder; (ii) violate any applicable Laws or safety and security
procedures or  rules of a Seller, any Company, any Project or any customer of
a Seller or any Company; or (iii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel,
infringe upon any attorney-client work product or like privilege. All requests
by Buyer for access  pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be submitted or
directed exclusively to Sellers. Prior to the Closing, without the prior
written consent of Sellers, which may be withheld in Sellers' sole discretion,
Buyer shall not contact any  suppliers to, or customers of, any Seller or any
Company, and Buyer shall have no right to perform air, surface, invasive or
subsurface investigations of the Real Property or invasive or destructive
sampling of any Project Assets. Buyer  shall, and shall cause its
Representatives and counsel to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement with respect to any access or information provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.02_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller, each Company and each of their respective Affiliates, contractors,
agents or employees against and from any Loss arising from Buyer's or any of
its  representatives' or contractors' conduct of the due diligence activities
permitted by this _Section 6.02_ or any breach of this _Section 6.02_.

 

 

Section 6.03 _Supplement to Schedules_. From time to time prior to the
Closing, but in no event more than once in every seven (7) day  period, the
Sellers shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend
the Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or of which it
becomes aware after the Effective Date (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ "). The
Sellers shall deliver any Schedule Supplement no later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date or, if less than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, a period prior  to the Closing Date which Buyer
acknowledges in writing was reasonably sufficient to review such information.
Any disclosure in any such Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have
cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation  or warranty
contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of the indemnification or
termination rights contained in this Agreement or of determining whether or
not the conditions set forth in Section 8.02 have been satisfied; provided, 
however, that if Buyer has the right to, but does not elect to, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01 or determine the conditions set forth in
Section 8.02(q) have not been satisfied within five (5) Business Days of its
receipt  of such Schedule Supplement, then Buyer shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement or to determine that
the conditions set forth in Section 8.02(q) have not been satisfied with
respect to only such matter  solely based on the facts and circumstance as it
was disclosed to Buyer at the time of the Schedule Supplement, taken by
itself; provided, however, that the foregoing waiver shall not affect Buyer's
right to terminate this Agreement or to  determine that the conditions set
forth in Section 8.02(q) have not been satisfied if either the facts and
circumstances with respect to such matter materially change from those
disclosed to the Buyer at the time of the Schedule Supplement or  additional
matters are disclosed in subsequent Schedule Supplements which, when taken
together with the matters presently disclosed, would in the aggregate permit
the Buyer to terminate this Agreement or to determine that the conditions
set  forth in Section 8.02(q) have not been satisfied. For avoidance of
doubt, no Schedule Supplement shall affect any right of indemnification under
this Agreement.

 

 

 

41  

Section 6.04 _Officer, Manager and Director Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is
now, or has been at any time  prior to the Effective Date or who becomes
prior to the Closing Date, an officer, manager or director of the Company, as
provided in the certificate of formation or the operating agreement of the
Company, in each case as in effect on the date  of this Agreement, or
pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the Effective Date and disclosed
in _Schedule 6.04(a)_ , shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their respective  terms.

 

 

(b) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this _Section 6.04_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
officer, manager or  director to whom this _Section 6.04_ applies without the
consent of such affected officer, manager or director (it being expressly
agreed that the officers, managers and directors to whom this _Section 6.04_
applies shall be  third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.04_ , each of
whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.04_ ).

 

 

(c) In the event Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or  surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation
or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and  assigns of Buyer or the Company, as
applicable, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.04_.

 

 

 

42  

Section 6.05 _Confidentiality_.

 

 

(a) This Agreement and all information disclosed to a Party by another Party
pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Parties shall  abide by the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that nothing in this _Section 6.05_ shall limit the
disclosure by any Party of any information in connection with any litigation
between the Parties (provided that such  Party has taken all reasonable
actions to limit the scope and degree of disclosure in any such litigation).

 

 

(b) After the Closing, each Party agrees to treat and hold as confidential any
information concerning the business and affairs of the other Party to which
such Closing relates, which  is not already generally available to the public
(the " _Confidential Information_ "), refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information other than in accordance with this Agreement, for 
purposes internal to Seller and its Affiliates or as otherwise agreed in
writing between Seller or any of its Affiliates and Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. In the event that a Party is requested or required (by oral
question or request for  information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, such Party shall (to the extent
practical given the circumstances) notify the  other Parties promptly of the
request or requirement so that the other Parties may seek an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section
6.04(b)_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the  receipt of a
waiver hereunder, a Party is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose
any Confidential Information to any tribunal, such Party may disclose the
Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided that such Party shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of any
other Party, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as a  Party shall designate.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.05_ or the
Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer agrees that Sellers may, indirectly or
directly, through one or  more intermediaries, furnish this Agreement to any
Person in connection with the termination of any other agreement with respect
to the acquisition of any of the Projects by such Person.

 

 

 

43  

Section 6.06 _Governmental Approvals and Other Third-Party Consents_.

 

 

(a) From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, each Party shall (and
shall each cause their respective Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to make or obtain all  notices, filings, consents, waivers,
confirmations and approvals of Governmental Authorities that any of Seller,
Buyer or their respective Affiliates are required to make or obtain before the

47  

(c) This Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any

subcontracting,  sublicensing or subleasing to the Company, or under which
the applicable Seller would, at the Company's expense, enforce for the benefit
of the Company any and all of its rights against a third party (including any
Governmental Authority)  associated with such Project, claim, right or
benefit (collectively, " _Third Party Rights_ "), and Sellers would promptly

associated with any drawdown or claim related to any Unreleased Support
Obligations related to such Project which results from an  event occurring on

time period for the agreement described in _Section 6.11(c)_ for another one
hundred eighty (180) days  following the termination of the initial period of
one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date. Buyer shall notify
Sellers in writing of such determination and (i) if Buyer chooses not to
extend the time period, or (ii) it has been  three hundred sixty (360) days
after the Closing Date, Sellers shall promptly (but not later than ten (10)
Business Days following the receipt of such notification) pay to Buyer the (X)
the sum of (I) amount set forth on Annex IV with respect  to such Project
Asset which was paid by Buyer to Sellers on the Closing Date plus (II) any
amount paid by Buyer for indemnification in accordance with _Section 6.11(c)_
, minus (Y) any amounts paid by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to _Section
6.11(c)(ii)_. If the amount paid by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to _Section
6.11(c)(ii)_ exceeds the sum of (x) amount paid by  Buyer to Sellers as
described in _Section 6.11(c)(i)_ plus (y) any amount paid by Buyer for
indemnification in accordance with _Section 6.11(c)_ , then Buyer shall

Obligations to be replaced with letters of credit, guaranties or other

with the terms and conditions of the applicable Permit or Contract and, in
connection therewith, with respect to any Unreleased Support Obligation
represented by a letter of credit or guarantee, Buyer  shall (or shall cause
the applicable beneficiary thereof to) use commercially reasonable efforts to
return such Unreleased Support Obligation to the applicable Seller or the
applicable issuer of such Unreleased Support Obligation, as  applicable,
together with a cancellation request executed by the applicable beneficiary
thereof; and

Support Obligation with respect to which the applicable Seller or its
Affiliates (excluding the  Companies and the Company Subsidiaries) has not
been released draws or collects on any such Unreleased Support Obligation or
the applicable Seller and/or its Affiliates (excluding the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries), as  applicable, incur a cost or expense on account of
any such Unreleased Support Obligation and (ii) the event or condition giving

Affiliates. To the extent that any such payment or reimbursement is not  made
as provided above within fifteen (15) days after the applicable Seller
notifies Buyer in writing of such drawing or payment recoverable pursuant to
the first sentence of this _Section 6.13(b)_ , such drawing or payment shall 
bear interest (y) in respect of any Unreleased Support Obligation that accrues
interest, at the rate per annum at which such Unreleased Support Obligation
accrues interest or (z) in respect of any Unreleased Support Obligation that
does  not accrue interest, at a rate equal to Reference Rate plus one and
one-half percent (1.5%) per annum, in either case, from the date that Buyer
shall have been obligated to reimburse the  applicable Seller and/or its
Affiliates under this _Section 6.13(b)_ through the date of payment. Buyer
shall indemnify the applicable Seller and/or its applicable Affiliates for any
reasonable and documented expenses incurred by  the applicable Seller and/or

for United States federal and state income Tax purposes as a sale to Buyer of
all of the assets  of the Company and an assumption by Buyer of all of the
liabilities of the Company. No later than ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a preliminary schedule allocating
the Purchase Price among  the Company's assets which shall be consistent with
the allocation in _Annex IV_ (the " _Purchase Price Tax Allocation Schedule_
").       Buyer shall permit Sellers thirty (30) days to review and
comment on the preliminary Purchase Price Tax Allocation Schedule. Sellers
shall notify Buyer in writing within thirty (30) days of its acceptance of or
any dispute of the  Purchase Price Tax Allocation Schedule. If Sellers notify
Buyer of a dispute, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any disputed aspects with respect to the preliminary Purchase Price Tax
Allocation Schedule.   Sellers and Buyer agree and acknowledge that each
shall report the Transactions to the applicable Tax authorities consistent
with the final Purchase Price Tax Allocation Schedule mutually agreed upon
pursuant to this _Section 7.01_.       The final Purchase Price Tax
Allocation Schedule shall be revised to take into account subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price, including any indemnification payments.

 

 

Section 7.02 _Tax Covenants_. Each Seller shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the applicable Company after
the Closing Date with respect to a Tax Return  for a period ending on or
before the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law). With respect
to any Tax Return covering a Straddle Period that is  required to be filed
after the Closing Date:

 

 

(a) Buyer shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared (in a manner consistent
with practices followed in prior taxable periods and in compliance with Law
except as required by a  change in Law or fact) and shall deliver a draft of
such Tax Return to Sellers for Sellers' review and approval at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax
Return;

 

 

(b) Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate and consult with each other in order to
finalize such Tax Return; and

 

 

(c) thereafter, subject to Sellers' payment to Buyer of any portion of such
Tax in compliance with this _Section 7.02_ with respect to the Straddle
Period, Buyer shall  cause such Tax Return to be executed and duly and timely
filed with the appropriate Tax authority and shall pay all Taxes shown as due
and payable on such Tax Return.

 

 

Section 7.03 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) Sellers shall indemnify the Company and Buyer and hold them harmless from

_Pre-Closing Taxes_ ") and Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any such Taxes
pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ within thirty (30) days after payment of such
Taxes by Buyer or the Company; provided that, Sellers  shall not be required
to indemnify Buyer for any penalties resulting from Buyer's failure to timely
file any Tax Return.

 

 

 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify Sellers for any Taxes of the Companies or relating
to the business of the Companies that are prepaid by Sellers on or before the
Closing Date and  that are applied to a taxable period after the Closing Date
(including to the post-Closing portion of a Straddle Period).

 

 


 

 

 

54  

Section 7.04 _Straddle Period_. With respect to any Company or Company
Subsidiary characterized as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Seller and Buyer agree to take into account their varying interests
in such partnership  using the interim closing of the books method permitted
by Treasury Regulation Section 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii). Otherwise, in the case of
Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that begins before and
ends after the Closing  Date (each such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "),
Sellers and Buyer shall determine the Tax attributable to the portion of the
Straddle  Period that ends on the Closing Date as follows:

 

 

(a) in the case of ad valorem or property Taxes, the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days  in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and

 

 

(b) in the case of any other Tax, the amount which would be payable computed
on a closing of the books basis as if the relevant Tax period ended as of the
close of business on  the Closing Date.

 

 

Section 7.05 _Contests_. Buyer agrees to give prompt written notice to Sellers
of the receipt of any notice by the Company, Buyer or any of Buyer's
Affiliates which involves the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any  Action, in respect of which an indemnity for which Sellers may be liable
pursuant to _Section 7.03_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "). Sellers  shall control the
contest or resolution of any Tax Claim; provided, however, that Buyer shall
have the right to attend or participate in respect of any such Tax Claim and
Sellers shall obtain the prior written consent of Buyer before  entering into
any settlement, compromise or commencement of litigation in respect of a Tax
Claim.

 

 

Section 7.06 _Tax Refunds and Credits_. Sellers and Buyer each agree to pay to
the other Parties any refund or rebate received  (whether by payment, credit,
offset or otherwise) by it or any of its Affiliates, in respect of any Taxes
for which the other Party is liable, within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such refund or rebate. Sellers and Buyer shall  cooperate to take any
necessary steps to claim any such refund or rebate. _Schedule 7.06_ lists each
anticipated property tax refund claim.

 

 

Section 7.07 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Sellers and Buyer
shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of
them reasonably may request of the other in determining the Purchase Price Tax
Allocation Schedule, filing any  Tax Return pursuant to this _Article VII_ ,
or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the
Company. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or  portions thereof, together with accompanying
schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by Tax authorities. Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall retain
all Tax Returns, schedules and work  papers, records and other documents in
its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company for six (6) years. Prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, records and other documents  in its possession relating to Tax
matters of the Company for any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date, Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, shall provide the other Parties with
reasonable written notice and offer the other  Party the opportunity to take
custody of such materials. Any unresolved disputes regarding the Purchase
Price Tax Allocation Schedule, filing any Tax Return pursuant to this _Article
VII_ , or in connection with any audit or  other proceeding in respect of
Taxes of the Company will be resolved by a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The costs and expenses of
such  independent accounting firm shall be shared equally by Buyer and
Seller.

 

 

 

55  

Section 7.08 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification
payments pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall  be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price by the Parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law in which case such indemnification payments shall be grossed-up and
paid on an after-tax basis.

 


 

 

Section 7.09 _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of this _Article VII_ shall survive for the full
period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any 
waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus sixty (60) days.

 


 

 

Section 7.10 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes imposed on Buyer, a Seller
or a Company by Law as a result of this Agreement  shall be paid by Buyer.
Buyer shall timely file all Tax Returns for any Transfer Tax as required by
Law and shall notify Seller when such filings have been made. This _Section
7.10_ shall not apply to any Transfer Taxes  resulting from the Project Asset
Transfer, which the applicable Seller shall be solely responsible for paying.

 


 

 

Section 7.11 _Overlap with Indemnification_. Other than with respect to claims
for Recapture Liability which shall be governed by  _Article IX_ , to the
extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant to _Article IX_ may
overlap with an obligation or responsibility pursuant to this _Article VII_ ,
the provisions of this _Article VII_   shall govern.

Section 9.05 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 


 

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action or other legal  proceeding made or
brought by any Person who is not a Party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of
a Party to this Agreement or a Representative or counsel of the foregoing (a "
_Third-Party       Claim_ ") against such Indemnified Party with respect
to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written  notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses  by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if  reasonably practicable, of the Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense  of any Third-Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own
counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense; provided, in advance of its exercise of  such right, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party an acknowledgement
in writing of the unqualified obligation of the Indemnifying Party to
indemnify the Indemnified Party for such claim; provided, however, such 
right of the Indemnifying Party shall not apply to any claims that relate to
or involve: (i) alleged violations of criminal law; (ii) any claim seeking
specific performance or injunctive relief; or (iii) an amount in controversy
that is  in excess of the liability limitations for the applicable subject
matter in this Agreement. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to _Section 9.05(b)_ , it shall have
the  right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim
in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall have the  right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the
Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to  compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to
promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as
provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section
9.05(b)_ , pay,  compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third-Party Claim. Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in
all reasonable respects in  connection with the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of _Section 6.05_
) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without expense
(other than reimbursement of  actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending
party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 


 

 

63  

(b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not  enter into settlement of
any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, except as provided in this _Section 9.05(b)_. If a firm offer is made
to settle a Third-Party Claim without leading to  Liability or the creation
of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all Liabilities and obligations in  connection with such Third-
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such
offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to  consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such
event, the maximum Liability of the Indemnifying Party as to  such Third-
Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle  the
Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to _Section 9.05(a)_ , it shall not agree to any settlement without  the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

 


 

 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a  " _Direct Claim_ ") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written  notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the 
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or
may  be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim, which response may include a statement that the
Indemnifying Party  intends to attempt to cure the matter giving rise to the
Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party states that it intends to cure the
matter giving rise to the Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have a
period of thirty (30)  days in which to effect a cure (such period shall be
automatically extended for a period of up to an additional sixty (60) days if
the Indemnifying Party is diligently attempting to effect a cure but needs
additional time to do so)  (such period, including any extension, the " _Cure
Period_ "). During such thirty (30)-day period following receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of the notice of the Direct Claim and during the  Cure
Period, the Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable access to the Company's
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records in connection with the Indemnifying Party and its 
professional advisors' investigation of the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim; provided, however, that any such
investigation or access shall not: (i) interfere unreasonably with normal
operations of any Indemnifying Party; (ii) violate any applicable Laws or
safety and security procedures  or rules of any Indemnifying Party; (iii) in
the reasonable opinion of counsel, infringe upon any attorney-client work
product or like privilege; or (iv) require the Indemnifying Party to disclose
any information that it considers in  good faith to be confidential or
proprietary or that would be adverse to its interests in a legal proceeding.
If the Indemnifying Party does not respond to the notice of Direct Claim
within the thirty (30)-day period provided above  for such response or does
not cure the matter giving rise to the Direct Claim within the Cure Period,
the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which
case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such  remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.06 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated  by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law in which case such indemnification payments shall be grossed-up and
paid on an after-tax basis.

 


 

 

 

64  

Section 9.07 _Exclusive Remedies_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any  and all claims (other
than claims made under _Article VII_ or arising from Fraud on the part of a
Party in connection with the Transactions) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set  forth herein
or any claim otherwise relating to the Project Assets or subject matter of
this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this _Article IX_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each  Party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein it may have against the  other Party
and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives and counsel
arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in _Article VII_ or this _Article IX_.       Nothing
in this Section 9.07 shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any
equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to _Section
11.11_ or to seek any remedy on account of Fraud by any Party.

prior to the Closing:

 


 

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyer;

 


 

 

(b) by Buyer by written notice to Sellers if:

 


 

 

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform
any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by a Seller
pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the
conditions specified in _Article VIII_ and such breach, inaccuracy or failure
cannot  be cured by such Seller on or before the date that is the later of
(A) six (6) months after the Effective Date and (B) three (3) months following
receipt of written notice of such breach, inaccuracy or failure, provided,
that such  cure period shall not extend beyond the later of (x) twelve (12)
months after the Effective Date and (y) thirty (30) days following any receipt
during the twelfth (12th) month after the Effective Date of written notice of
such breach, inaccuracy or failure, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Parties (the " _Outside_ _Termination Date_ ");

 


 

 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ shall
not have been fulfilled by the Outside Termination Date, unless  such failure
shall be due to the failure of Buyer to perform or comply with any of the
covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by
it prior to the Closing; or

 


 

 

(c) by a Seller by written notice to Buyer if:

 


 

 

 

65  

(i) Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform
any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
specified in _Article VIII,_ and such breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot
be  cured by Buyer on or before the Outside Termination Date, unless
otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties; or

 


 

 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.03_ shall
not have been fulfilled by the Outside Termination Date, unless  such failure
shall be due to the failure of such Seller to perform or comply with any of
the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied
with by it prior to the Closing; or

 


 

 

(d) by Buyer or a Seller in the event that:

 


 

 

(i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Transactions illegal
or otherwise prohibited; or

 


 

 

(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order
(including with respect to the HSR Act, if applicable) restraining or
enjoining the  Transactions, and such Governmental Order shall have become
final and non-appealable.

 


 

 

Section 10.02 _Termination Fee_.

 


 

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement by a Seller in
accordance with _Section 10.01(c)(i)_ , Buyer shall immediately pay to
Sellers, as liquidated  damages in connection with any such termination, a
fee in the amount of the Deposit and the interest accrued thereon (the "
_Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , payment of such Termination  Fee by Buyer
to Sellers shall be satisfied through application of the Deposit and the
interest accrued thereon provided by Buyer to Sellers in accordance with
_Section 2.03_.

 


 

 

(b) Upon Sellers' receipt of the Termination Fee: (i) no Seller or Affiliate
of any Seller shall have any rights or claims against Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer relating  to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or
any of the Transactions (other than the Surviving Obligations), whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; and (ii) Buyer shall have
no further liability to  the Sellers, the Companies or any Affiliate of
Sellers with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (other than the
Surviving Obligations). If Buyer is required to pay the Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 10.02_ ,  payment of the Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers, the Companies or any of their
respective former, current and future Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, incorporators, shareholders,  members, managers, partners, agents,
attorneys, other representatives, successors and/or assigns against Buyer and
any of its respective former, current and future Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, incorporators,  shareholders, members, managers,
partners, agents, attorneys, other representatives, successors and/or assigns
(the "Buyer Related Parties") for any Losses suffered or incurred as a result
of or  under this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the
Transactions, including the failure of the Closing to occur (other than the
Surviving Obligations). The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event
shall Buyer be  required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion
or, together with the Buyer Related Parties, have any liability in excess of
the Termination Fee under this Agreement prior to the Closing under any
circumstances.

 


 

 

 

66  

(c) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 10.01_ that does not require payment of the Termination Fee, in
accordance with _Section      10.02(a)_ , Sellers shall return the
Deposit and the interest accrued thereon to Buyer.

 


 

 

(d) Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this _Section 10.02_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that,
without these  agreements, the Sellers and Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement. Each of the Parties further acknowledges that the payment by Buyer
of the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but constitutes liquidated damages in
a reasonable  amount that will compensate the Sellers in the circumstances in
which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on  the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

 


 

 

Section 10.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Article X_ ,  this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party
except:

 


 

 

(a) as set forth in _Section 6.05_ , _Section 6.09_ , this _Article X_ and
Article XI; and

 


 

 

(b) that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for Fraud (
_clause (a)_ and _clause (b)_ , collectively,  the " _Surviving Obligations_
").
