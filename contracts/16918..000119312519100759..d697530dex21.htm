2.6 _Consents_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, convey
or deliver any Purchased Asset or any benefit arising under or resulting from
such Purchased Asset if the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery
thereof, without the Consent of a third party, (i) would constitute a breach
or other contravention of the rights of such third party, (ii) would be
ineffective with respect to any party to a Contract concerning such Purchased
Asset, or (iii) would, upon transfer, in any way adversely affect the rights
of Buyer under such Purchased Asset. If the sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery by any Seller Party to, or any assumption by Buyer of,
any interest in, or Liability under, any Purchased Asset requires the Consent
of a third party, then such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, delivery
or assumption shall be subject to such Consent being obtained. Without
limiting _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_, to the extent any Assumed Contract may not
be assigned to Buyer by reason of the absence of any such Consent (each, a
"Restricted Contract"), Buyer

 



22  shall not be required to assume any Assumed Liabilities arising under such
Restricted Contract. Notwithstanding the failure to obtain prior to the
Closing any Consent with respect to any Restricted Contract or any other
Purchased Asset, subject to _Article IX_ , the Closing shall occur without any
adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof.

 

(b) To the extent that any Consent in respect of a Restricted Contract
or any other Purchased Asset shall not have been obtained on or before the
Closing Date, following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain any such
required Consent or any release, substitution or amendment required to novate
all Liabilities under any and all Assigned Contracts or other Liabilities that
constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the unconditional
release of all parties to such arrangements, so that Buyer shall be solely
responsible for such Liabilities after the Closing Date. As soon as a Consent
for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, delivery or assumption of a
Restricted Contract or other Purchased Asset is obtained, Seller shall
promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Restricted Contract or
Purchased Asset to Buyer for no additional consideration.

 

(c) To the extent that any Restricted Contract or other Purchased Asset
and/or Assumed Liability cannot be transferred to Buyer following the Closing
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into such arrangements (such as
subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to Buyer the economic
and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, operational equivalent of
the transfer of such Restricted Contract or other Purchased Asset and/or
Assumed Liability to Buyer as of the Closing Date and the performance by
Buyer of its obligations with respect thereto. Buyer shall, as agent or
subcontractor for Seller or the applicable Seller Subsidiary, pay, perform and
discharge fully the Liabilities of the applicable Seller Party thereunder
from and after the Closing Date. To the extent permitted under applicable Law,
the Seller Parties shall hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon
receipt thereof such Purchased Asset and all income, proceeds and other
monies received by the Seller Parties to the extent related to such Purchased
Asset in connection with the arrangements under this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_;
_provided_ that the Seller Parties shall be permitted to set off against
such amounts all Liabilities that the Buyer is required to pay, perform or
discharge in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence and any direct
costs associated with the retention and maintenance of such Purchased Assets.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall not apply to any consent or approval
required under any Competition Law, which consent or approval shall be
governed by _Section_ __ _ 7.6_. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
including any arrangement for Buyer to be provided with any of the benefits of
any Purchased Asset, shall constitute a waiver of Buyers rights under
_Article IX_ unless and until Buyer either provides written waivers thereof
or elects to proceed to consummate the Transactions at the Closing.

ARTICLE III

 

PURCHASE PRICE.

 

3.1 _Purchase Price_.

 



23 On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, in consideration
of the sale of the Purchased Assets, in addition to the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities, Buyer shall pay to Seller (or its designees), an
aggregate amount in cash equal to (a) One Billion Seven Hundred Million
Dollars ($1,700,000,000) (the "Base Purchase Price"), _plus_ (b) the amount,
if any, by which the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory or the Final
Book Value of the Product Inventory, as the case may be, exceeds the Target
Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory, _minus_ (c) the amount, if any,
by which the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory or the Final Book
Value of the Product Inventory, as the case may be, is less than the Target
Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory, _minus_ (d) the amount of the
Accrued Depletion Allowances (the "Purchase Price").

 

3.2 _Determination of Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(a) No later than the fifth Business Day prior to the anticipated
Closing Date (i) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a written
statement setting forth Sellers best estimate of the amount of the Accrued
Depletion Allowances (including reasonable supporting documentation and
calculations), as determined as of the most recent available date in
accordance with the illustrative calculation thereof set forth on _Schedule
3.2(a)(i)_ (the "Closing Accrued Depletion Allowances Statement"), and (ii)
representatives of Seller and Buyer shall take a physical count and
inspection of the Inventory, other than the Bailment Inventory of Seller, in
accordance with the Inventory inspection and testing procedures attached
hereto as _Schedule 3.2(a)(ii)_ (the "Testing Procedures"). Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate reasonably in connection with such physical count and
inspection.

 

(b) Following such count and inspection, the Parties shall agree in
accordance with the Testing Procedures on the results thereof in a written
report (the "Agreed Inventory Report"). At the Closing, the Base Purchase
Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(i) the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of the
Accrued Depletion Allowances, as set forth in the Closing Accrued Depletion
Allowances Statement;

 

(ii) if the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Agreed Inventory Report is less than the Target Closing Book Value of the
Product Inventory, then the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount
by which the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory is less than the
Target Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory;

(iii) if the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth
in the Agreed Inventory Report is greater than the Target Closing Book Value
of the Product Inventory, then the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by
the amount by which the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory is
greater than the Target Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory; or

 

(iv) if the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Agreed Inventory Report is equal to the Target Closing Book Value of the
Product Inventory, then there shall be no adjustment to the Base Purchase
Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_.

 



24 (c) If the Parties are unable to agree on the results of the physical
count and inspection prior to the Closing, then Seller shall deliver its
determination of the physical count and inspection to Buyer as soon as
reasonably possible following completion of the physical count
and inspection, but no later than at the Closing (the "Estimated Inventory
Report"). For purposes hereof, the "Estimated Closing Book Value of the
Product Inventory" means (a) the aggregate value of the Product Inventory
(other than the Bailment Inventory), (i) based on the Estimated Inventory
Report, and (ii) valued at the applicable Seller Partys costs of such
Inventories by reference to the unit cost set forth on _Schedule 1(b)_ ,
except as the Parties may otherwise mutually agree, _plus_ (y) the aggregate
value of the Bailment Inventory as set forth on the Bailment Reports. At the
Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(i) the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of the
Accrued Depletion Allowances, as set forth in the Closing Accrued Depletion
Allowances Statement;

 

(ii) if the Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as
set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report is less than the Target Book
Value of the Product Inventory, then the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product
Inventory is less than the Target Book Value of the Product Inventory;

(iii) if the Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as
set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report is greater than the Target Book
Value of the Product Inventory, then the Base Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Book Value of the
Product Inventory is greater than the Target Book Value of the Product
Inventory; or

 

(iv) if the Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as
set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report is equal to the Target Closing
Book Value of the Product Inventory, then there shall be no adjustment to the
Base Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_.

 

The Base Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_, as the case may be, is referred to herein as the
"Estimated Purchase Price".

 

3.3 _Post-Closing Inventory Adjustment_.

 

(a) In the event that the Parties do not agree on the results of the
physical count and inspection and, therefore, determine the Estimated
Purchase Price based on the Estimated Inventory Report, then during the five
Business Days immediately following the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have
with respect to the physical count set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report
and if such agreement has not been reached at the end of such five Business
Day period, Seller and Buyer shall identify in writing the amount in dispute
and shall immediately engage an Independent Accountant to conduct only a
physical count of the Inventory, which physical count of the Inventory shall
be set forth in a written report delivered to the Parties and shall be
conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall

 



25  be enforceable in a court of law (such report as agreed to by the Parties
after the Closing or as completed by the Independent Accountant, is referred
to herein as the "Final Physical Inventory Report"). In the event that
determination of usability and salability of the Inventory extends past the
Closing Date, at such time as the usability and salability of the Inventory is
conclusively determined pursuant to the Testing Procedures, such Inventory at
the value determined shall be set forth in a written report delivered to both
Parties and shall be used, along with the Final Physical Inventory Report, to
determine the final inventory ("Final Inventory Report"). For purposes hereof
the "Final Book Value of the Product Inventory" means (i) the value of the
Product Inventory (other than the Bailment Inventory) (A) based upon the Final
Inventory Report, and (B) valued at the applicable Seller Partys costs of
such Inventories by reference to the unit cost set forth on _Schedule 1(b)_ ,
except as the Parties may otherwise mutually agree, plus (ii) the aggregate
value of the Bailment Inventory as set forth on the Bailment Reports. Within
two (2) Business Days of the Independent Accountants delivery of the Final
Inventory Report, the Purchase Price shall be further adjusted and payments
made, if and as applicable, as follows.

(i) if the Final Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Final Inventory Report is greater than the Estimated Closing Book Value of
the Product Inventory as set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report, then
Buyer shall pay in immediately available funds to Seller the amount by which
the Final Book Value of the Product Inventory is greater than the Estimated
Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory;

 

(ii) if the Final Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Final Inventory Report is less than the Estimated Closing Book Value of
the Product Inventory as set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report, then
Seller shall pay in immediately available funds to Buyer the amount by which
the Final Book Value of the Product Inventory is less than the Estimated
Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory; and

 

(iii) if the Final Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set
forth in the Final Inventory Report is equal to the Estimated Closing Book
Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report,
then there shall be no further adjustment to the Purchase Price and no payment
shall be made by either Party pursuant this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_.

(b) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant engaged pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, if any, shall be allocated between Seller, on
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the
portion of the amount contested by a Party that is not awarded to that Party
bears to the total amount actually contested by such Party.

 

(c) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the Parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

3.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

During the Pre-Closing Period and after the Closing, as necessary, the Parties
will work cooperatively to select and to jointly engage the Qualified
Appraiser and will work together cooperatively to direct the Qualified
Appraiser in obtaining valuations of the Brands, the Business

 



26  and the other Purchased Assets. Upon completion of such valuation, the
Qualified Appraiser shall deliver to each of the Parties (a) a copy of their
appraisal report (the "Appraisal Report"), and (b) a schedule allocating the
Purchase Price (including any Assumed Liabilities treated as consideration for
the Purchased Assets for Tax purposes) based on the valuations of the Brands,
the Business and the other Purchased Assets (as set forth in the Appraisal
Report) and prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (the
"Allocation Schedule"). The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Qualified Appraiser to deliver the Appraisal Report and the
Allocation Schedule to the Parties within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date. The Allocation Schedule shall be deemed final unless either Party
notifies the other Party in writing that such Party objects to one or more
items reflected in the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Allocation Schedule to the Parties (the "Objection Period").
In the event of any such objection, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller and
Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation
Schedule within thirty (30) days of the end of the Objection Period (the
"Allocation Negotiation Period"), such dispute shall be finally resolved by
the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Qualified Appraiser
and the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer.
Seller shall deliver to Buyer an IRS Form 8594 prepared in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days of the end of the Objection Period
or the Allocation Negotiation Period, as the case may be, which IRS Form
8594 shall be subject to Buyers approval, not to be unreasonably withheld
(and provided that Buyer shall have been deemed to have approved such IRS Form
8594 as prepared by Seller if Buyer fails to deliver a written objection
thereto to Seller within thirty (30) days of receipt thereof). Seller and
Buyer agree to file such IRS Form 8594, as prepared by Seller and approved (or
deemed to have been approved) by Buyer, and to file all federal, state and
local Tax Returns in accordance with the Allocation Schedule, _provided_ that
nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax authority based upon or arising
out of the Allocation Schedule, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be
required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Tax authority challenging such Allocation Schedule. If any payment is
treated as an adjustment of the Purchase Price, the Allocation Schedule shall
be adjusted in a manner consistent with the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_. If Seller or Buyer is required to file a Tax Return
concerning the Allocation Schedule before the Independent Accountant has
resolved any disputed items (taking into account valid extensions of time
within which to file, which shall be sought to the extent necessary to permit
the resolution of disputed items), such disputed items shall be reflected on
such Tax Return based on the Allocation Schedule prepared by the Qualified
Appraiser, and shall be amended if necessary to reflect the determination of
the Independent Accountant with respect to the disputed items.

Purchased Assets, its properties related to the operation of the Business and
to carry on its portion of the Business as currently conducted. Seller is

REPRESENTATIONS AND

 

WARRANTIES OF BUYER.

 

Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Seller, as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing, as follows:

 

6.1 _Organization and Qualification of Buyer_.

 

Buyer is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
the State of California. Buyer has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Buyer is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in the states required due to the
operation of its business, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not be reasonably expected to have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect.

 

6.2 _Corporate Authority; Binding Effect_.

 

Buyer has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and perform
its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery by Buyer
of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, the
performance by Buyer of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Buyer, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
Seller) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by Enforceability Limitations. When each other
Transaction Document to which Buyer is or will be a party has been duly
executed and delivered by Buyer (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by each other party thereto), such Transaction Document will
constitute a legal and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
Enforceability Limitations.

 

6.3 _No Conflict_.

 

The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party, the performance by Buyer of
its obligations hereunder or thereunder, and the consummation of the
Transactions will not (a) violate, conflict with or result in any breach of
any provision of Buyers articles of incorporation or by-laws; or (b) violate,
conflict with, require any notice or consent under, result in any breach of,
or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under any Contract to which Buyer is party
or by which it is bound; or (c) assuming all consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings or registrations contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ have been obtained or made, violate any applicable Law
or Order, in the case of clauses (b) and (c), except as would not have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

 



49 6.4 _Consents and Approvals_. 

Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.4_ , no consent, approval or authorization
of, or declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Body is
required for the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and for the
consummation by Buyer of the Transactions.

 

6.5 _Permits_.

 

Except for those Permits set forth on _Schedule 2.1(g)_ to be assigned or
transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and those Permits to be
maintained by the Seller Parties after the Closing pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement, Buyer has, or will have as of or as promptly as
practicable following the Closing, all permits, licenses and registrations
of all agencies, whether federal, state, local or foreign, necessary for
Buyers operation of the Business following the Closing, including all
permits, licenses and registrations from agencies regulating or otherwise
having jurisdiction over beverage alcohol products. All such permits,
licenses and registrations are or will be valid and in full force and effect,
and Buyer will be in material compliance with all such permits, licenses and
registrations.

 

6.6 _Legal Proceedings and Orders_.

 

There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to Buyers Knowledge, threatened
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates that, individually or in the
aggregate, have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding or unsatisfied Orders or stipulations
under which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is bound that, individually or in
the aggregate, have had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.7 _Financial Capability_.

 

Buyer has, and will have as of the Closing, sufficient cash on hand (without
giving effect to any unfunded financing regardless of whether any such
financing is committed) to pay the Purchase Price and all related fees and
expenses in connection with the Transactions Buyer hereby acknowledges and
agrees that Buyers obligation hereunder to consummate the Transactions is
not contingent or conditioned upon Buyer obtaining any financing to pay the
Purchase Price.

 

6.8 _Solvency_.

 



50 Immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions,
assuming that the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (disregarding any
qualifications and exceptions contained therein relating to materiality,
Business Material Adverse Effect or any similar qualification or exception):
(a) the fair saleable value (determined on a going-concern basis) of the
assets of Buyer will be greater than the total amount of its Liabilities,
taken as a whole (including all Liabilities, whether or not reflected in a
balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP); (b) Buyer will be able to pay
its debts and obligations in the ordinary course of business as they become
due; and (c) Buyer will have adequate capital to carry on its businesses,
including the Business.

6.9 _Brokerage_.

 

No Person has acted, directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder, agent,
investment banker or financial advisor for Buyer or its Affiliates and no
Person is entitled to any fee or commission or like payment from Buyer or its
Affiliates in connection with the Transactions.

 

6.10 _Certain Matters as to Buyer_.

 

Buyers funds are derived from legitimate business activities. Buyer is not a
Person with whom Seller is prohibited from engaging in any transaction due to
any embargo or sanction of any Governmental Body, or any terrorism or money
laundering laws, including due to Buyer or any Person that has ownership in or
control over Buyer being (a) subject to embargos or sanctions of any
Governmental Body; (b) in violation of any terrorism or money laundering laws;
or (c) listed on a published Governmental Body list, including the Specially
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List maintained by the Office of
Foreign Assets Control in the U.S. or other lists of similar import in any
jurisdiction.

 

6.11 _Independent Investigation; No Other Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) Buyer has conducted its own independent investigation, review and
analysis of, and reached its own independent conclusions regarding, the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Business and its operations,
assets, condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects. Buyer acknowledges
that it and its Representatives have been provided adequate access to the
personnel, properties, premises, records and other documents and information
of and relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities for such purpose. Buyer has been represented by, and had the
assistance of, counsel in the conduct of its due diligence, the preparation
and negotiation of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and the
consummation of the Transactions. In entering into this Agreement, Buyer
acknowledges that it has relied solely upon its own investigation, review and
analysis and has not relied on and is not relying on any representation,
warranty, opinion, projection, forecast, statement, memorandum, presentation,
advice, information or other statement made or provided by, on behalf of or
relating to Seller, Sellers Affiliates or the Business except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _Article V_ (as
modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules) and in the Closing Documents.

 



51 (b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) other than the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article V_ and in the
Closing Documents, none of Seller, any of Sellers Affiliates or any other
Person has made or makes any representation or warranty, written or oral,
express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to the Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, including any representation or
warranty as to (A) merchantability or fitness for a particular use
or purpose, (B) the operation or probable success or profitability of the
Business following the Closing or (C) the accuracy or completeness of any
information (including any projections or forecasts) regarding the Business
made available to Buyer and its Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or their investigation of the Business, and (ii) Buyer shall have no
right or remedy (and Seller will have no liability whatsoever) arising out of,
and Buyer expressly disclaims any reliance upon, any representation,
warranty, opinion, projection, forecast, statement, memorandum, presentation,
advice, information or other statement made or provided by, on behalf of or
relating to Seller, any of Sellers Affiliates, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Business, including in any materials, documentation
or other information regarding the Business made available to Buyer or any of
its Representatives in connection with this Agreement or their investigation
of the Business (including information memoranda, data room materials,
projections, estimates, management presentations, budgets and financial data
and reports), or any errors therein or omissions therefrom, other than
the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article V_ (as
modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules) and in the Closing Documents and
the rights of Buyer expressly set forth in this Agreement in respect of such
representations and warranties.

(c) EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIFIC REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED
IN THIS _ARTICLE VI_ AND IN THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS, NEITHER BUYER NOR ANY OTHER
PERSON MAKES, OR HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY BUYER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES TO
MAKE, ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT

OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER MADE BY BUYER, ANY AFFILIATE OF BUYER OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES AND IF

SELLER PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND REPRESENTATIVES AS HAVING
BEEN AUTHORIZED BY BUYER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES. EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIFIC
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS _ARTICLE VI_ AND IN THE
CLOSING DOCUMENTS, BUYER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR
ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OPINION, PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT,
MEMORANDUM, PRESENTATION, ADVICE OR INFORMATION MADE, COMMUNICATED, OR
FURNISHED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO THE SELLER PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING ANY OPINION, PROJECTION, FORECAST,
STATEMENT, MEMORANDUM, PRESENTATION, ADVICE OR INFORMATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
OR MAY BE PROVIDED TO THE SELLER PARTIES BY ANY DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE,
AGENT, BROKER, BANKER, CONSULTANT OR REPRESENTATIVE OF BUYER OR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES). IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER EXPRESSLY 

 



52  ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS NOT RELYING ON ANY STATEMENT,
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, INCLUDING THOSE WHICH MAY BE CONTAINED IN ANY

(d) NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS _SECTION 6.11_
SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT, OR BE USED AS A DEFENSE AGAINST, SELLERS RECOURSE

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS.

 

7.1 _Conduct of the Business Prior to the Closing_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and
the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Period"), except as (i) otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, (ii) set forth on _Schedule 7.1(a)_ , or (iii)
required by any Law or Order applicable to Seller, the Purchased Assets or
operation of the Business, Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to operate the Business
in the ordinary course of business in all material respects, including with
respect to maintaining and preserving the Purchased Assets (including
distribution and promotion of the Brands consistent in all material respects
with past practice, maintaining inventory levels for the Brands that are
normal for the time of year (taking into account product sales during the
preceding twelve (12) months), maintaining consistent pricing for the Products
and foregoing any exceptional promotional or clearance activities) and
relationships with customers, suppliers and others having material business
dealings with the Business. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller and the
Seller Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
past practice to protect, enforce, maintain and avoid abandonment of or damage
to the Business Intellectual Property. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that Buyers contact with any Distributor, vendor, supplier or customer
of the Business affects the Seller Parties operation of the Business in the
ordinary course, such deviation from the ordinary course shall not be deemed
to be a breach of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, neither Seller nor any of the Seller
Subsidiaries (nor any third party acting at Sellers or any Seller
Subsidiarys direction or with their consent) shall: (i) transfer, assign or
grant any license or sublicense (other than non-exclusive licenses or
sublicenses granted in the ordinary course of business) of any rights under or
with respect to, or any encumbrance upon, any of the Business Intellectual
Property or allow the abandonment or lapse of any right relating to the
Business Intellectual Property; (ii) create, assume or permit to exist any new
Encumbrances on the Brands, the Business or any of the Purchased Assets,
other than Permitted Encumbrances; (iii) except for any Purchased Asset that
is obsolete or

 



53  which is not material to the Brands, the Business or the Purchased Assets,
sell, lease, license or otherwise transfer any of the Purchased Assets, or
cancel any of their rights or claims, other than in the ordinary course of
business for fair and adequate consideration; or (iv) grant to any third
party, or otherwise allow any third party to acquire, any license (other than
non-exclusive licenses or sublicenses granted in the ordinary course of
business), right, title or interest in or to any of the Business Intellectual
Property.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that Buyer intends to establish new trade
names/fictitious business names (each, a "DBA") referencing the Brands and
the Trademarks promptly following the Closing. Seller covenant and agree that,
promptly upon Buyers request at any time following the Closing Date, the
Seller Parties will amend their respective organizational documents and all
public records as necessary to change their entity names to new names
unrelated to the Brands, the Trademarks and all other trade names, service
marks, brand names and other designations of origin included in the Buyer
Intellectual Property.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Business prior to the Closing.
Prior to the Closing, Seller shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over the
Business.

7.2 _Access to Purchased Assets_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Seller Subsidiaries to, continue to provide Buyer and its Representatives with
all documents, materials and information reasonably requested by Buyer and
reasonable access to the Purchased Assets in order for Buyer to confirm
the satisfaction of the Closing conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)_. To the extent not already provided to Buyer, Seller will during the
Pre-Closing Period, at Buyers option, either (i) deliver three 750ml samples
of each item of bulk or bottled Product Inventory to Buyer or (ii) provide an
opportunity for Buyer to obtain samples of any items of bulk Product Inventory
directly from the applicable tanks. All access pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.2(a)_ shall be (A) conducted during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice to the Seller Parties, (B) conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of the Business or any
other business of the Seller Parties, (C) coordinated through Garth Hankinson
or a designee thereof and (D) conducted at Buyers sole cost and expense, and
the Seller Parties shall have the right to have one or more of their
Representatives present at all times during any access contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_. Such access for Buyer and its Representatives during
the Pre-Closing Period shall include granting Buyer and Buyers
Representatives a right of entry on the Real Property to perform such non-
destructive and non-intrusive soil, engineering and geological tests and other
physical inspections and to make such other examinations, reviews or reports
as Buyer shall reasonably deem appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller Parties
shall not be required to provide access to or disclose information where such
access or disclosure would, in the Seller Parties reasonable judgment, (1)
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other immunity or protection from
disclosure of any Seller Party, (2) conflict with any (x) Law (including any
Law relating to data protection or privacy) or Order applicable to any Seller
Party, the Purchased Assets or operation of the Business, (y) Contract to
which any Seller Party is party or by which any of the Purchased

 



54  Assets or other assets or properties of any Seller Party are bound or (z)
other obligation of confidentiality, or (3) result in the disclosure of
competitively sensitive information;  _provided_ , that if any information is
withheld pursuant to this sentence, the applicable Seller Party will (x)
inform Buyer as to the general nature of what is being withheld and (y) use
its commercially reasonable efforts (1) to accommodate any request from Buyer
for information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ in a manner that does
not result in such a violation or waiver or disclosure of competitively
sensitive information or (2) to the extent applicable, to obtain the required
consent of the relevant third Person to permit such access or disclosure.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the Pre-
Closing Period, Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives shall be
permitted to (I) contact any Distributor solely regarding the distribution of
Products following the Closing; _provided_ , that (A) Seller shall, for period
of five days after the date hereof, have the right to contact each
Distributor prior to Buyer contacting any Distributor, (B) Buyer is only
permitted to discuss the distribution of Products following the Closing, and
(C) Buyer shall not discuss with any such Distributor any anti-competitive
information, any details of the Transaction that would be deemed material and
that are not otherwise publicly disclosed, including the status of any
regulatory approvals, or any confidential information concerning any existing
contractual relationship between any of the Seller Parties and any such
Distributor, and (II) with the prior written consent of Seller (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), contact any
other vendor, supplier or customer of the Business regarding the business or
operation of the Business by Buyer following the Closing, in order to, and the
Parties shall work collaboratively in good faith to, ensure the smooth
transition of the production and distribution of the Products in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ that any such contact by
Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives with any such vendor, supplier,
distributor or customer of the Business shall be conducted in a manner that
shall not cause any material disruption to the Seller Parties operation of the
Business during the Pre-Closing Period or the operation of the Seller Parties
or their Affiliates respective businesses other than the Business prior to
the Closing.

 

(b) Any information obtained by Buyer or its Representatives pursuant
to _ Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to be "Confidential Information"
for the purposes of the Transaction Non-Disclosure Agreement and shall be
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Transaction Non-
Disclosure Agreement, including limitations on disclosure and use.

 

(c) With respect to the Owned Real Property, during the Pre-Closing
Period, Buyer shall have the right to approve any exceptions to title that are
not Permitted Encumbrances and which could materially adversely affect the
ownership or value of the Owned Real Property of the use of the Owned Real
Property as currently used as of the date of this Agreement, which approval by
Buyer shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
_however_ , that Buyer shall have no right to approve any exception to title
that is not a Permitted Encumbrance if the Title Company has agreed to remove
or insure over such exception as part of the Owned Real Property Title
Policies. However, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Seller shall remove and the Owned Real Property Title Policies
issued at the Closing shall not include as an exception, any mortgages, deeds
of trust or other such readily ascertainable monetary liens against any parcel
of Owned Real Property resulting from the voluntary acts or omissions of a
Seller Party.

 



55 7.3 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall give prompt notice
to the other Party of (i) any fact, event or circumstance known to such Party
that individually or taken together with all other facts, events and
circumstances known to such Party, has had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect
(with respect to Seller) or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect (with respect to
Buyer), as the case may be, or would cause or constitute a breach of any of
such Partys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein, (ii) the failure of any condition precedent to such other Partys
obligations hereunder or any occurrence which, to the Knowledge of Seller or
the Knowledge of Buyer, as applicable, is reasonably likely to result in any
of the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ becoming incapable of being
satisfied, (iii) any written notice or other written communication received by
such Party from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party
is or may be required in connection with the consummation of the Transactions,
(iv) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Entity received by such Party regarding the consummation of the Transactions,
or (v) the commencement of any Legal Proceeding against such Party that, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ (with respect to Seller) or
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ (with respect to Buyer), as the case may be; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 7.3(a)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to
the other Party, and (B) disclosure by Seller shall not be deemed to amend or
supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Partys
failure to give notice of any occurrence as required pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.3(a)_ shall be (i) deemed to be a breach of the covenant contained in 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_, but instead shall (if applicable) constitute only a
breach of the applicable underlying representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, or (ii) taken into account in determining whether the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article IX_ have been satisfied.

7.4 _Efforts to Consummate_. 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, during
the Pre-Closing Period, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause
the Seller Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts (unless,
with respect to any action, another standard of performance is expressly
provided for herein) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including
satisfaction (but not waiver) of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article IX_.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to obtain the release of the
guarantees pertaining to the Purchased Assets set forth on _Schedule 7.4(b)_
(collectively, the "Seller Party Guarantees"), including the provision by
Buyer of a replacement guarantee (in form and substance reasonably

 



56  acceptable to Buyer) in favor of the beneficiary of any such Seller Party
Guarantee in order to obtain the release of the applicable Seller Party from
such Seller Party Guarantee.

 

7.5 _Consents_.

 

During the Pre-Closing Period, except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __
_ 2.6_, each of Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
give all notices to, and obtain all Consents (which may be conditioned on the
consummation of the Transactions) from, all Persons required pursuant to any
Assumed Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and its Affiliates
shall not have any obligation to (a) amend or modify any Contract, (b) pay any
consideration to any Person for the purpose of obtaining any such Consent,
(c) relinquish or forbear any rights, or agree to any restriction on the
conduct of any business or operations or the ownership or exercise of any
assets, properties or rights, or (d) pay any costs or expenses of any
Person resulting from the process of obtaining such Consent.

7.6 _Governmental Approvals; Regulatory Filings_.

(a) Each of the Parties will use commercially reasonable
efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance
is expressly provided for herein) to, and the Parties shall work
collaboratively to, take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner possible
the Transactions, including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to obtain (and
cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental
Body (which actions will include furnishing all information required under the
HSR Act and any other Law relating to antitrust, competition, trade
regulation, foreign investment or the protection of national security
(collectively, "Competition Laws", provided that in no event shall
"Competition Laws" be deemed to include any Law exclusively regarding the
regulation of alcoholic beverages) required to be obtained or made by any
Party or their Affiliates in connection with the Transactions), and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Additionally, the Parties will each use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and will work collaboratively to, fulfill all conditions precedent
to this Agreement and will not take any action after the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining
of, or to result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from
any such Governmental Body or third party required to be obtained prior to the
Closing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Parties will keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental
Body, including by working cooperatively in connection with any sales,
divestitures or dispositions of assets or businesses if and to the extent
undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_. In this
regard, prior to the Closing, each Party will promptly consult with the other
Party to provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the case
of correspondence, provide the other Party (or their counsel) copies of) all
filings made by such Party 

 



57  with any Governmental Body or any other information supplied by such Party
to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Body in connection with this
Agreement, excluding any confidential financial data of such Party. Each
Party will promptly inform the other Party of, and if in writing, furnish the
other Party with copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications,
advise the other Party orally of), any communication from any Governmental
Body regarding any of the Transactions, and permit the other Party to review
and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other
Party in connection with, any proposed written (or any material proposed
oral) communication with any such Governmental Body. If any Party or any
representative of such Party receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Body with respect to the
Transactions, then such Party will make, or cause to be made, promptly and
after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request. Buyer will not participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Body in connection with this Agreement (or make oral submissions
at meetings or in telephone or other conversations) unless it consults with
Seller in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Body,
gives Representatives of Seller the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meeting. Each Party will furnish the other Party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof, but excluding any confidential financial data of such
Party) between it and any such Governmental Body with respect to this
Agreement, and furnish the other Party with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to
any such Governmental Body. The Parties may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other Party under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ as material for "Clean
Team Members only." Such materials and the information contained therein will
be given only to (i) designated employees of the Parties and their affiliates
and (ii) outside counsel and experts hired by the Parties and their
Affiliates (together, the "Clean Team" or "Clean Team Members") and will not
be disclosed by such Clean Team Members to any other directors, officers or
employees of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials or its legal counsel; _provided_ that
materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ may be redacted to
remove references concerning the valuation of Seller or Buyer, discussion of
the terms or potential terms of the transactions described in this Agreement
and the terms of other potential competitive transactions (if any), and
otherwise, as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and as
necessary to address reasonable privilege and confidentiality considerations.
To the extent that transfers of any Permits issued by any Governmental Body
are required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions, the Parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such transfers.

 

(c) The Parties will use all efforts to, and will work collaboratively
to, file, as promptly as practicable but in any event no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR
Act, and the Parties will use all efforts to, and will work collaboratively
to, file, as promptly as practicable, any other filings or notifications
under any other applicable Competition Laws. Except as provided in _Section_
__ _ 7.6(e)_, in the event that the Parties receive a formal request for
additional information or documentary materials after an initial notification
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Competition Law (a "Second Request"), the
Parties will each use commercially reasonable efforts to, and will work
collaboratively to, respond 

 



58  to such Second Request, as applicable, as promptly as practicable and
counsel for the Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such
Second Request review process.

 

(d) The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to, and will
work collaboratively to, resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by any Governmental Body with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act or
any other applicable Competition Law. In connection therewith, if any Legal
Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Transactions as violating the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law,
the Parties will cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest
and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ will limit the right of any
Party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ so long as
such Party has, up to the time of termination, complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_. Each of the
Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or
other applicable Competition Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly
as practicable after the execution of this Agreement.

 

(e) Buyer agrees to take the following actions, provided there has been
no Triggering Action Communication, solely to the extent necessary to avoid
or eliminate any impediments under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Termination Date): (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
separate sale, divestiture or disposition of a portion of the Business, the
Brands and/or the Purchased Assets or any portion of Buyers or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates own assets, brands or businesses, _provided_ that
in such case, Buyer shall have the sole discretion to determine whether the
sale, divestiture or disposition will be comprised of a portion of the
Business, the Brands and/or the Purchased Assets or a portion of Buyers or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates own assets, brands or businesses, or both, in
order to avoid or eliminate such impediments; or (ii) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Buyers or
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its or
their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or
assets of the Business, in each case as may be necessary in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent
injunction, in any Legal Proceeding under the HSR Act or any
other Competition Law, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
the Closing (each of (i) and (ii) above, a "Remedy"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
_that_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of a
Triggering Action Communication, Buyer shall not be required to take any
independent action but, instead, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith for a period of fifteen (15) Business Days (the "Negotiation Period")
to amend this Agreement to permit the consummation of the Transactions in a
manner that eliminates any impediments under the HSR Act or any other
Competition Law resulting from a Triggering Action Communication, and, if the
Parties are unable to agree upon such an amendment within such Negotiation
Period, then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)_. In the event Buyer fails to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)_, then Buyer shall
perform the applicable Triggering Action as necessary to avoid or eliminate
all impediments under the HSR Act or other Competition Law, as the case may 

 



59  be, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will not be obligated to take any action
that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, nor will Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to sell, divest or dispose
of, any of their own assets, brands or businesses.

 

(f) Buyer agrees to provide such security and assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any Governmental Body or other third party whose consent or approval is sought
in connection with the Transactions. Whether or not the Closing occurs, Buyer
and Seller agree to share equally the responsibility for all fees and
payments (including filing fees and legal and professional fees) to any third
party or any Governmental Body in order to obtain any consents, approvals or
waivers pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, other than the fees of and
payments to the legal and professional advisors of the individual Parties.

 

(g) Buyer and Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with,
or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by
any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, at any time prior to the Termination Date if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining,
any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Body necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of
any Governmental Body entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions; or (iii) delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

7.7 _Books and Records_.

 

Following the Closing, for a period consistent with such Partys commercially
reasonable record retention policies but not less than seven years, each of
Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) give Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, and its Representatives reasonable access to
(A) its Representatives, including employees, and (B) to the extent relating
to the Business and capable of being separated from the Books and Records
relating to any other businesses of the Seller Parties without imposing an
unreasonable burden or cost on the Seller Parties (unless Buyer agrees to
assume any such unreasonable cost), Books and Records and other information
with respect to the Business relating to periods prior to the Closing, in each
case for any reasonable purpose, including as may be necessary for (1)
the preparation of Tax Returns and financial statements and (2) complying
with any audit request, subpoena or other investigative demand by any
Governmental Body or for any Legal Proceeding, subject in all cases to
reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel in
respect of applicable Laws relating to the confidentiality of information
(including any Competition Laws), and (ii) maintain all such Books and Records
in accordance with such Partys commercially reasonable record retention
policies. All access provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be
conducted (x) during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to
the Party providing access, (y) in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the normal operations of the businesses of the Party
providing access, and (z) at the accessing Partys sole cost and expense 

 



60  (including any costs and expenses for making copies of Books and Records),
and the Party providing access shall have the right to have one or more of its
Representatives present at all times during any visits, examinations,
discussions or contacts contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Buyer nor
Seller shall be required to provide any access or disclose any information
where such access or disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Party
otherwise required to provide such access or disclosure, (I) jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege or other immunity or protection from disclosure of
the Party otherwise required to provide such access or disclosure, (II)
conflict with any (x) Law (including any Law relating to data protection or
privacy) or Order applicable to the Party otherwise required to provide
such access or disclosure or the assets, information or operation of the
businesses of the Party otherwise required to provide such access or
disclosure, (y) Contract to which the Party otherwise required to provide such
access or disclosure is party or by which any of the assets or properties of
the Party otherwise required to provide such access or disclosure is bound or
(z) other obligation of confidentiality, or (III) result in the disclosure of
competitively sensitive information; _provided_ , that if any information is
withheld pursuant to this sentence, the applicable Party will (x) inform the
accessing Party as to the general nature of what is being withheld and (y) use
its commercially reasonable efforts (1) to accommodate any request from the
accessing Party for information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ in a
manner that does not result in such a violation or waiver or disclosure of
competitively sensitive information or (2) to obtain the required consent of
the applicable third Person to permit such access or disclosure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if the Parties are in an adversarial
relationship in any Legal Proceeding, the furnishing of information,
documents or records in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be
subject to any applicable rules relating to discovery and (y) any and all such
Books and Records may be destroyed by a Party if such destroying Party sends
to the other Party written notice of its intent to destroy such Books and
Records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the Books and Records
to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the sixtieth (60th)
day following such notice unless the other Party notifies the destroying Party
that such other Party desires to obtain possession of such Books and Records,
in which event the destroying Party shall transfer such Books and Records to
such requesting party and such requesting Party shall pay all reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses of the destroying Party in connection therewith.

 

7.8 _Post-Closing Cooperation_.

 

After the Closing Date, each Party shall provide the other Party, at such
other Partys cost and expense, with such reasonable assistance as may be
requested by such other Party in connection with any Legal Proceeding or audit
of any kind or nature whatsoever or the preparation of any response, demand,
inquiry, filing, disclosure or the like (including any Tax Return or form)
relating to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business.

 

7.9 _Confidentiality_.

 

The terms of the Transaction Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be deemed
incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein and, notwithstanding
the Closing, the Transaction Non-Disclosure Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms except that (a) upon the
Closing, Buyers obligations thereunder with respect to "Confidential
Information" (as such term is defined in the Transaction Non-Disclosure
Agreement), to the extent 

 



61  relating to the Business, shall terminate, and (b) Buyers obligations
thereunder with respect to "Non-Solicitation" shall not apply to any
Employees. With respect to Confidential Information that does not relate to
the Business, such Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms
and conditions of the Transaction Non-Disclosure Agreement. With respect to
Representatives of Buyer that, prior to the Closing, were Representatives of
Seller, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall vitiate such
Representatives confidentiality obligations owed to Seller as a consequence
of such Representatives former employment with Seller.

 

7.10 _Employees_ _and Employee Benefits_.

 

Matters regarding certain employees are set forth in _Schedule 7.10_.

 

7.11 _Damage or Casualty Loss_.

 

Damage by fire or other casualty to any of the Purchased Assets after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Closing (a "Casualty Loss") shall not
result in any reduction or adjustment to the Purchase Price or relieve Buyer
or Seller from its obligations in respect of the Closing, so long as Seller,
at its option, either (a) repairs such damage prior to the Closing at
Sellers sole cost and expense, retaining all insurance proceeds (and the
rights thereto) related to such damage, (b) collects (and when collected pays
over to Buyer) any insurance proceeds related to such damage, or (c) assigns
to Buyer such insurance proceeds ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that any repairs
made pursuant to clause (a) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ and any insurance
proceeds paid over or assigned to Buyer pursuant to clauses (b) and (c),
respectively, of this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall restore or enable Buyer to
restore (as the case may be) the affected properties or assets to a condition
that enables the continued operation of the Business or the Purchased Assets,
in all material respects, as conducted prior to such damage, in each case as
determined by a qualified engineering firm mutually agreeable to the Parties).
At all times during the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Seller Subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and effect insurance policies
providing adequate insurance coverage for the Business and the
Purchased Assets and which are sufficient for compliance with all Laws and
Contracts to which the Seller Parties are a party or by which they are bound
in connection with the Business.

 

7.12 _Further Assurances_.

 

From time to time after the Closing Date, each Party shall, and shall cause
its controlled Affiliates to, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any
other assurances or documents or instruments of transfer or assumption and
take such further actions reasonably requested to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and give effect to the Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in the event that (a) Buyer or Seller discovers
following the Closing that any asset that was intended to be transferred
pursuant to this Agreement was not transferred at the Closing, Seller shall or
shall cause its Affiliates promptly to assign and transfer to Buyer all
right, title and interest in such asset for no additional consideration, (b)
Buyer or Seller discovers following the Closing that any asset that was not
intended to be transferred pursuant to this Agreement was transferred at the
Closing, Buyer shall promptly assign and transfer to Seller or Sellers
designated Seller Subsidiary all right, title and interest in such asset for
no additional consideration, (c) Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any
funds following the Closing that relate

 



62  to a Purchased Asset, Seller shall or shall cause its Affiliates promptly to
remit such funds to Buyer and (d) Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives any
funds following the closing that relate to an Excluded Asset, Buyer shall or
shall cause its Affiliates promptly to remit such funds to Seller or Sellers
designated Seller Subsidiary.

 

7.13 _Bulk Sales Laws_.

 

The Parties hereby waive compliance with the provisions of any bulk sales,
bulk transfer or similar laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be
applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to
Buyer.

 

7.14 _Distributors; Distributor Indemnifications_.

 

(a) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the
distribution agreements currently in effect between the Seller Parties and
their respective Distributors are included in the Assumed Contracts and no
such distributor agreements shall be assigned or transferred to Buyer, in
whole or in part, hereunder. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither Seller nor
any of the Seller Subsidiaries (nor any third party acting at Sellers or any
Seller Subsidiarys direction or with their consent) shall deliver any notices
to their respective Distributors withdrawing any products sold under the
Brands from distribution under the relevant distribution agreements or
otherwise terminating such Distributors rights to distribute such products
under such agreements. Promptly following Closing, Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries shall notify their respective Distributors of the closing of the
Transactions and shall cooperate with Buyer and provide instructions to their
Distributors as reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate the transfer of
the products sold under the Brands into Buyers distribution network. The
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Buyer will be permitted to and will
be solely responsible for entering into its own distribution agreements or
other arrangements with distributors of Buyers choosing with respect to the
distribution of the products sold under the Brands following the Closing.

 

(b) In the event that Buyer elects to appoint a new distributor to
distribute products sold under any Brand in any territory post-Closing that
is different than the Distributor appointed by Seller to distribute such
product in such territory prior to the Closing, and Buyer seeks an indemnity
from such new distributor for itself against any liability to Sellers former
Distributor of such products in such territory, then Buyer shall ensure that
any such indemnity extends equally to Seller and its Affiliates and that
Seller and its Affiliates are made express third party beneficiaries of such
indemnity.

7.15 _Other Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Each Seller Party shall cooperate with and provide reasonable
assistance to Buyer in connection with the transfer or re-issuance of any
Permit, including signing transfer applications, "use up" letters for labels
and permit termination forms. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller Party
grants to Buyer the limited right to sell all finished goods Inventory that is
labeled with any name or trademark of such Seller Party as of the Closing Date
and to use up all labels and other packaging materials included in the
Inventory bearing any name or trademark of such Seller Party.

 



63 (b) Each Seller Party shall provide such "use up" authorizations as may
be required to enable Buyer to register and sell the Brands using labels
bearing such Seller Partys name and address. To the extent required for Buyer
to conduct the Business, each Seller Party shall maintain its existing label
and Brands registrations and price postings with respect to the Brands and
shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with Buyers commercially reasonable
efforts to make and obtain Buyers label approval, brand registrations and
price postings with respect to the Brands, in each case, until the earlier to
occur of (i) the date on which Buyers label approval, Brands registration and
price postings are completed with respect to the Brands, or (ii) the six-
month anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

7.16 _Intellectual Property_.

 

The Seller Parties shall not, themselves or through any third party: (a) at
any time after the Closing Date, for so long as any item of Business
Intellectual Property remains valid and enforceable, challenge the validity,
enforceability, ownership, scope, or effectiveness of such item of Business
Intellectual Property or Buyers rights with respect to such item of Business
Intellectual Property; (b) (i) at any time after the Closing Date, use, apply
for or register any trademark, service mark, trade name, trade dress, label
design or package design that is identical to any item of
Business Intellectual Property, or (ii) for a period of seven (7) years after
the Closing Date, use, apply for or register any trademark, service mark,
trade name, trade dress, label design or package design that is confusingly
similar to any item of Business Intellectual Property, in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii), for so long as any such item of Business Intellectual Property
that is a trademark, service mark, trade name, trade dress, label design or
package design remains valid and enforceable, _provided_ , that the Parties
agree that with respect to any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this clause (b)(ii), the standard to be applied in determining whether such
trademark, service mark, trade name, trade dress, label design or package
design is confusingly similar to any such item of Business Intellectual
Property shall be the same as that applied under the federal laws of the
United States with respect to such matters, and such standard shall not be
affected in any manner by the inclusion of this clause (b)(ii) in this
Agreement; or (c) at any time after the Closing Date, use any image, design
and/or other artwork, name or reference on any trade dress, packaging
materials, media, advertising and/or marketing or other material(s) that
would be reasonably viewed as portraying, depicting, referencing or implying a
relationship with the Brands, the Business or the Purchased Assets, and Seller
and the other Seller Parties will remove, no later than the Closing Date, any
such image, design and/or other artwork, name or reference from any of their
trade dress, packaging materials, media, advertising and/or marketing and
other materials, including without limitation websites, digital and social
media. Buyer and the Seller Parties agree that the trademark "Cuvee Sauvage"
is not confusingly similar to the trademark "Cheval Sauvage" and Buyer shall
not, itself or through any third party, at any time after the Closing Date,
for so long as "Cuvee Sauvage" remains a valid and enforceable trademark,
challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership, scope, or effectiveness of
"Cuvee Sauvage" or any Seller Partys or any of its current or future
Affiliates rights with respect to "Cuvee Sauvage". The Seller Parties hereby
irrevocably waive any moral rights each may claim or have appurtenant to the
Business Intellectual Property. The Seller Parties further covenant and agree
that they will not at any time prior to, or for a period of twenty-four (24)
months following the Closing Date, disparage or defame the Brands, the
Business or any Purchased Assets through any public announcements, press
releases, investors calls or similar corporate communications directed or
approved by an executive

 



64  officer of Seller; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing covenant shall not apply to any communication that is not a
corporate communication directed or approved by an executive officer of
Seller, including any statements made by any Seller Partys salespersons or
other non-executive employees to any Person that compares the products of any
Seller Party or Affiliate thereof favorably to any Product or is otherwise in
the nature of a statement any salesperson or other non-executive employee
might make regarding a competitor or its products.

 

7.17 _Escrow Matters_.

 

The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to negotiate in
good faith and prior to or concurrently with the Closing enter into an escrow
agreement with the Escrow Holder, in a form mutually agreed upon by the
parties thereto (the "Escrow Agreement"), for the establishment of an escrow
account and the provision of escrow and title services in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

7.18 _No Solicitation_.

From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_ , except in
connection with the Transactions, Seller shall not, and shall cause the other
Seller Parties and its and their respective Affiliates and Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit or initiate or induce or encourage,
or take any other action to facilitate, any Alternative Transaction or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Alternative Transaction, (b) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any
information in furtherance of, or otherwise cooperate in any way in
furtherance of, any Alternative Transaction or any inquiry or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction, or (c)
approve, endorse, recommend, execute or enter into any Contract, letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or merger, acquisition or similar agreement
constituting, contemplating or otherwise relating to any Alternative
Transaction or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Alternative Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not prohibit any of the Seller
Parties or their respective Affiliates or Representatives from responding to
inquiries by any Person about a possible Alternative Transaction in order to
inform such Person of the existence of the obligations contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.18_; _provided_ , that Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of
the receipt by any of the Seller Parties or, to Sellers Knowledge,
their respective Affiliates or Representatives, of any inquiry or proposal
relating to an Alternative Transaction in respect of Purchased Assets or one
or more Brands representing at least Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars
($250,000,000) of Net Sales, which notice shall identify the Purchased Assets
or the Brands that are the subject of such inquiry or proposal, and, to the
extent not prohibited by a confidentiality agreement in place on or before the
date hereof, Seller shall (x) promptly notify Buyer of the material terms
thereof and the identity of the person or group involved, (y) promptly furnish
Buyer with a copy of any written inquiry, proposal or other information
relating to such Alternative Transaction, and (z) keep Buyer informed on a
current basis of any modifications to such inquiry, proposal or other
information.

 

7.19 _Consent to Transfer Membership Interest_.

 



65 During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall use, and shall cause the WICER
Member to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents (which
may be conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions) from all Persons
required to assign and transfer the Membership Interest to Buyer in
accordance with the terms of the Limited Liability Company Agreement of WICER,
LLC, dated January 19, 2007, as amended (the "WICER LLC Agreement"). In the
event the Seller Parties are unable to obtain such Consents, the Parties
agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Membership
Interest shall not be assigned or transferred to Buyer hereunder and shall not
be included in the Purchased Assets, and instead, the WICER Member shall sell
to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from the WICER Member, all certified
emission reductions and emission reduction credits which the WICER Member is
entitled to receive under the WICER LLC Agreement for a purchase price equal
to the aggregate remaining amount of the WICER Members Capital Commitments
(as defined in the WICER LLC Agreement) plus any other costs required to be
incurred by the WICER Member related thereto pursuant to the WICER LLC
Agreement.

 

7.20 _Shared Contracts and Assigned Portions of the Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) In order to complete the transfer of the Assigned Portions of the
Shared Contracts to Buyer or its designated Affiliates, Seller shall notify,
or cause the applicable Seller Subsidiaries to notify, the counterparties of
the Shared Contracts of the transfer of the Assigned Portions of the Shared
Contracts by Seller or a Seller Subsidiary to Buyer or its designated
Affiliate, and Seller and Buyer shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the cooperation of each counterparty to a Shared
Contract so that, as of the Closing Date or the earliest practicable time
thereafter, with the concurrence and consent of such counterparty, each Shared
Contract shall be divided into two contracts so that Buyer or its designated
Affiliate receives the benefit of the portion of the Shared
Contract pertaining to the Business (the "Assigned Portion of the Shared
Contract") and assumes the obligations of the respective Seller Party
associated with the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract, and the
respective Seller Party remains entitled to receive the benefit of the
balance of the Shared Contract and remains liable to perform its obligations
under the balance of the Shared Contract, and the respective Seller Party is
released from its obligations attributable to the Assigned Portion of such
Shared Contract; _provided_ that in no event shall any Seller Party or Buyer
be obligated to pay any fee or provide any confidential financial statements
to any such counterparty in order to obtain any such concurrence and consent;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller and Buyer shall each use their
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Assigned Portions of the
Shared Contracts (i) reflect the portions of the Shared Contracts used by the
Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Seller
Parties past practices, (ii) are in quantities appropriate for the Business
as currently conducted as of the date of this Agreement and (iii) in the case
of any Shared Contracts that are grape contracts, are based upon vineyard
blocks used by the Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with
the Seller Parties past practices. Buyer and Seller shall act in good faith
and reasonably cooperate in connection with such process of dividing each
Shared Contract (including the joint determination of the portion of the
Shared Contract pertaining to the Business and the allocation of Sellers and
Buyers respective rights and obligations under the Shared Contract). If a
Shared Contract includes schedules or statements of work that pertain
exclusively to the Business or are otherwise easily separable into a portion
of such Shared Contract that exclusively pertains to the Business, such
schedules or statements of work or other easily separable portions exclusively

 



66  related to the Business shall be the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract
and, if a Shared Contract is not easily separable in such manner, the Assigned
Portion of the Shared Contract shall be determined based on the historical
allocation of the goods or services provided to or received by the Business
under such Shared Contract.

 

(b) With respect to any Shared Contract for which such concurrence and
consent of the counterparty is not obtained prior to the Closing Date or
which cannot be separated in the manner described in _Section_ __ _ 7.20(a)_
(a "Joint Contract"), then, until such time as such Joint Contract may
be divided into two contracts as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.20(a)_, the
respective Seller Party will, for the purposes of the relationship with the
counterparty to such Joint Contract, remain the party to the Joint Contract,
and the Parties will, for the purposes of the relationship between
themselves, behave and treat each other as if the Assigned Portion of the
Shared Contract of such Joint Contract had effectively been assigned to and
assumed by Buyer or its designated Affiliate on and as of the Closing Date,
so that Buyer or its designated Affiliate shall receive from the Seller Party
the benefits of the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract, and Buyer or its
designated Affiliate shall perform the obligations of the respective Seller
Party related to the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract.

 

(c) In addition to their other obligations under this  _Section_ __ _
7.20_ and under _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, during the Pre-Closing Period, when
seeking to obtain any Consent required to assign any Assigned Contract set
forth on  _Schedule 7.20(c)_ and when dividing any Shared Contract set forth
on _Schedule 7.20(c)_ , Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall cooperate with each other in good faith, to negotiate a
reduction in the duration of the term of such Assigned Contract or Shared
Contract (including the Assigned Portion of such Shared Contract), as the case
may be.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, during the Pre-
Closing Period, the Seller Parties will not execute any new Contracts with the
counterparties to the Contracts and expired contracts set forth on _Schedule
7.20(d)_ for the goods or services to which such Contracts or expired
contracts relate, without the prior written consent of Buyer, and no Seller
Party shall be obligated to execute any such new Contract unless Buyer agrees
in writing that such new Contract shall be treated as an Assigned
Contract for all purposes under this Agreement.

7.21 _Termination of Certain Contracts_.

 

Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries to, take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary to effect the termination of all
Contracts between any Seller Party or Affiliate thereof, on the one hand, and
Constellation Brands Chile, on the other hand, if any, effective on or prior
to the Closing Date, without liability to Constellation Brands Chile or Buyer
or any of its Affiliates.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TAXES AND COSTS; APPORTIONMENTS.

 

8.1 _Transfer Taxes_ _and Fees_.

 



67 Buyer shall be responsible for the full and timely payment of all sales and
use, withholding, value-added, excise and ad-valorem Taxes (with the
exception of any Chilean withholding Taxes), filing and recordation fees
(including for Grant Deeds), customs duties and similar charges relating to
the sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets hereunder, and for the filing of
all Tax Returns related thereto, excluding any income or business and
occupation Taxes imposed on Seller. Seller shall provide such cooperation in
connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller from and against any and all Taxes and any Losses arising from
or related to Buyers failure to: (a) pay any such Taxes, fees or charges, or
(b) file any such Tax Return. Buyer and Seller agree to share equally the
responsibility for all transfer Taxes on the sale or transfer of the Real
Property hereunder. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in connection with the
signing and filing of all Tax Returns related to the sale or transfer of the
Real Property hereunder, including without limitation, signing and filing any
preliminary change of ownership reports, transfer tax affidavits, or other
similar forms.

8.2 _Transaction Costs_.

 

(a) Seller shall pay the cost of standard coverage under the Owned Real
Property Title Policies, consisting of the CLTA (or equivalent) portion
thereof. Buyer shall pay for the cost of any endorsements and the additional
cost above the cost of a CLTA (or equivalent) policy for any extended coverage
consisting of the ALTA (or equivalent) portion of the Owned Real Property
Title Policies.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall be
responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, including attorneys and accountants fees and expenses, whether
or not the Closing shall have occurred.

 

8.3 _Apportionments_.

 

(a) Except for transfer Taxes (which are addressed in  _Section_ __ _
8.1_), all Taxes with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets for a
taxable period that includes the Closing Date ("Straddle Period Taxes") that
are real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of the Closing
Date by the Escrow Holder, using the latest Tax bills, based on the number of
days of such taxable period ending on but not including the Closing Date (the
"Pre-Closing Straddle Period") and the number of days of such taxable period
beginning on and including the Closing Date through the end of such taxable
period (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period").

(b) Straddle Period Taxes other than Taxes described in _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)_, including but not limited to any Taxes payable as a result of the
application of Section 951 or 951A of the Code, shall be apportioned between
the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period based on
an interim closing of the books as of the Effective Time. For purposes of
allocating Straddle Period Taxes attributable to any equity interests in
partnerships or specified foreign corporations (within the meaning of Section
965(e) of the Code), the taxable year of any such partnerships or specified
foreign corporations shall be treated as ending as of the Effective 

 



68  Time. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall be liable for any Taxes of the Seller
Parties arising in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
(including any Taxes attributable to an election under Section 338 of the Code
with respect to the purchase of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement), except
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_. 

(c) Seller shall be liable for Pre-Closing Straddle Period Taxes and
Buyer shall be liable for Post-Closing Straddle Period Taxes. Except as
otherwise set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the party required by law to pay
any such Tax (the "Paying Party") shall file the Tax Return related to such
Tax within the time period prescribed by law and shall timely pay such Tax. To
the extent any such payment exceeds the obligation of the Paying Party
hereunder, the Paying Party shall provide the other party (the "Non-Paying
Party") with notice of payment, and within 10 days of receipt of such notice
of payment, the Non-Paying Party shall reimburse the Paying Party for the
Non-Paying Partys share of such Taxes.

 

8.4 _Prorations and Other Adjustments_.

 

To the extent not otherwise prorated or adjusted pursuant to this Agreement,
(a) Escrow Holder shall prorate between Seller and Buyer, as of the Closing
on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed to (but
not including) the Closing Date, those items set forth on _Schedule 8.4(a)_ ;
and (b) Buyer shall reimburse all documented customary farming costs incurred
by the Seller Parties with respect to the Real Property between March 31, 2019
and the Closing Date for the 2019 harvest. Any Taxes, charges and expenses
payable on an estimated basis shall be reconciled against actual Taxes,
charges and expenses as of the Effective Time, to the extent then possible,
and Seller shall provide a proposed reconciliation for Buyers approval.
Seller shall have a period of ninety (90) days following the Closing
to provide Buyer with a final reconciliation. If the final reconciliation
shows that Buyer or Seller owes the other additional sums, the Party owning
such sums shall pay such amount to the other Party within ten (10) days after
Buyers receipt of the final reconciliation. If the amount of any proration
cannot be determined at the Closing, the adjustments will be made at the
Closing based on the best available information and then re-prorated between
the Parties in accordance with the final reconciliation provided above.

8.5 _Certain Tax Returns; Cooperation_.

(a) Seller, at its own expense, shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of Constellation
Brands Chile and WICER, LLC that relate solely to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(the "Seller Tax Returns"). Buyer, at its own expense, shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax
Returns of Constellation Brands Chile and WICER, LLC relating to any Pre-
Closing Straddle Period other than the Seller Tax Returns. Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with each other, including the furnishing or making

required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials necessary
or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns. Each Party responsible for
the preparation and filing of a Tax Return of Constellation Brands Chile or
WICER, LLC pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)_ shall prepare such Tax
Returns consistent with the past practice of Constellation Brands Chile or
WICER, LLC, as applicable, except as otherwise required by applicable Law,
and

 



69  shall provide the other Party with a copy of such Tax Return no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the applicable due date of such Tax Return for the
other Partys review and comment. The Party responsible for the preparation
and filing of such Tax Return shall incorporate any reasonable comments of the
other Party received no later than fifteen (15) days after such other Partys
receipt of a copy of such Tax Return pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, to the extent such comments are consistent with applicable Law and
the past practice of Constellation Brands Chile or WICER, LLC, as applicable.
Any dispute between Buyer and Seller regarding such Tax Return shall be
resolved in a manner consistent with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.4_.

 

(b) Without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as required by
applicable Law, Buyer will cause Constellation Brands Chile and WICER, LLC not
to, (i) file, refile, or amend any Tax Return of Constellation Brands Chile or

Fraud, for purposes of this _Article XI_ or otherwise.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller
shall not be liable for any Loss or Losses resulting from any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement

5.15(g)_;

 

(ii) with respect to any individual claim or series of claims having the
same nature or origin where the Buyer Warranty Losses relating thereto are

75  or (iv) with the exception of the Excluded Liabilities, any Third Party

Buyer in this Agreement and the Closing Documents shall be deemed to have
been made without any qualifications as to Knowledge or materiality and,
accordingly, all references herein and therein to "Knowledge," "Buyer Material

qualifications as to Knowledge and materiality shall be deemed to be deleted
therefrom (except (x) where any such provision requires disclosure of lists of
items of a material nature or above a specified threshold, or (y) with
respect to any Knowledge qualifier, where it relates to any "threatened" act
or circumstance); _provided_ _further_ , that to the extent that any
materiality or Knowledge qualified representation or warranty is deemed to be
breached by Buyer solely as the result of the application of the proviso
immediately preceding this proviso, such breach will not constitute or give
rise to a claim of Fraud, for purposes of this _Article XI_ or otherwise.

(b) Buyer shall not be liable for any Loss or Losses pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 11.3(a)(ii)_ ("Seller Warranty Losses") (i) unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Seller Warranty Losses incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent that
such Seller Warranty Losses exceed the Deductible, and (ii) to the extent that
Seller Warranty Losses exceed the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to any Loss based on a breach of any
Buyer Fundamental Representation and (ii) nothing contained in this _Section_
__ _ 11.3(b_) shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner any rights
or remedies which Seller has, or might have, at Law, in equity or otherwise,
based on claims arising out of Fraud.

11.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Any Indemnification Claim required to be made on or prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.1_, and not made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.6_, shall be
irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived by the Party seeking
indemnification with respect thereto. It is the express intent of the Parties
that, if the applicable period for an item as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
11.1_ is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have
been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened
survival period contemplated hereby. The Parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ for the assertion of claims
under this Agreement are the result of arms length negotiation between the
Parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed
by the Parties.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages, except, in
each case, in the case of Fraud or to the extent payable in respect of a Third
Party Claim.

 

(c) In the event of any breach giving rise to an indemnification
obligation under this  _Article XI_ , the Indemnified Party shall take and
cause its Affiliates to take, or cooperate with

 



76  the Indemnifying Party if so requested by the Indemnifying Party in order to
take all commercially reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the
related breach.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this
_Article XI_ shall be paid without duplication and in no event shall any Party
hereto be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for Losses
that have already been paid or otherwise taken into account under this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall make
no claim for indemnification under this _Article XI_ in respect of any matter
that is taken into account in the calculation of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

 

(e) In calculating any Losses there shall be deducted any insurance
proceeds (net of applicable policy deductibles, costs, and expenses actually
incurred in connection with making any claim or obtaining such insurance
proceeds) and other indemnification, contribution or other similar payments
actually recovered by the Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof from any third
party with respect thereto. If any such proceeds or payments are received by
an Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates with respect to any Losses after
payment has been made by an Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee with respect
thereto, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay back, or cause its appropriate
Affiliates to pay back, the amount of such proceeds (up to the amount received
by the Indemnitee with respect to such Losses, subject to the limitations
herein) to the Indemnifying Party.

11.5 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_.

All indemnification payments made under this _Article XI_ shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

11.6 _Notice of _ _Indemnification_ _Claim_.

If the Indemnified Party shall become aware of any Indemnification Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably promptly give notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify whether the Indemnification
Claim arises as a result of a claim by a third party against the Indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim") or whether the Indemnification Claim does not
so arise, and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent
that the information is available) the factual basis for the Indemnification
Claim and the amount of the Indemnification Claim, if known or estimable. If
the Indemnified Party does not reasonably promptly give notice of any
Indemnification Claim as specified above, such failure shall not affect the
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification (subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article XI_ ) for Losses in connection with such
Indemnification Claim, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party forfeits
rights or defenses by reason of such failure.

 

11.7 _Third_ _Party_ _Claims_.

 

(a) With respect to any Third Party Claims or any audit or administrative
or judicial proceeding for which an Indemnified Party may have a claim for
indemnification, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its expense
and at its election, to assume control of the

 



77  negotiation, settlement and defense of the Claim through counsel of its
choice, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party,
so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party with reasonable evidence that the Indemnifying Party will
have the financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and
fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, the Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to assume such control in respect of Third Party Claims (x)
asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or customer
of the Business that is not then a supplier or customer of Seller or any of
its Affiliates as of such date, (y) that seek an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or (z) after such time
as Seller has indemnified Buyer Indemnified Parties for Buyer Warranty Losses
in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable limitation set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)(iii)_. The election of the Indemnifying Party to
assume such control shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice
of the Third Party Claim, failing which the Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have elected not to assume such control. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume such control, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to be informed and consulted with respect to the negotiation, settlement
or defenses of such Third Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its
behalf, but the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnified Party unless the named parties to any Legal Proceeding include
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and a representation of
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest
between them (such as the availability of different defenses), in which case
the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable costs and expenses of a
single counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party, having
elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to defend the Third Party
Claim diligently or within a reasonable period of time, subject to _Section_
__ _ 11.7(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume such
control, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to be informed and
consulted with respect to the negotiation, settlement or defenses of such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume or retain control
of the negotiation, settlement and defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall control the negotiation, settlement and defense of
such Third Party Claim, but in such case, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to be informed and consulted with respect to the negotiation,
settlement or defenses of such Third Party Claim and to retain counsel to act
on its behalf at its sole cost and expense.

(b) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the
negotiation, settlement or defense of any Third Party Claim, unless such
settlement provides for no fault on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides for a full release, in customary form, of the Indemnified Party, and
there are no obligations of the Indemnified Party under such settlement other
than monetary damages or other monetary payments to be paid for by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third
Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if (i) the Indemnifying Party
does not assume or retain control of the negotiation, settlement and defense
of a Third Party Claim and (ii) either of clauses (x) or (y) of the proviso
set forth in the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 11.7(a)_ applies, the
Indemnified Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



78 (c) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims and, regardless of
which party has control thereof as provided for herein, shall keep each other
reasonably advised with respect thereto.

 

11.8 _Direct Claims_.

 

The Indemnifying Party shall have sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice
with respect to any Indemnification Claim that does not result from a Third
Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not timely notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Direct Claim, such Direct Claim shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 11.3_, as applicable. If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such Direct Claim, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.9_.

 

11.9 _Manner of Payment_.

 

Within ten (10) Business Days after the amount of any Losses for which an
Indemnified Party is indemnified pursuant to this _Article XI_ is finally
determined, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to such Indemnified Party such
amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by such Indemnified Party at least three Business Days
prior to the payment date.

11.10 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 

Following the Closing Date, except with respect to claims for Fraud, the sole
and exclusive remedy for any claim under this Agreement, including any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or
other agreement contained in this Agreement shall be indemnification in
accordance with this _Article XI_ , and no Person will have any
other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or
otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation
or other agreement set forth herein it may have against the other Party hereto
and its Affiliates arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this  _Article XI_ and except with
respect to claims for Fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __
_ 11.6_ shall not (a) interfere with or impede the operation of the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ providing for the resolution of certain
disputes relating to the adjustment of the Purchase Price between the Parties
and/or by the Independent Accountant or (b) limit the rights of the Parties to
seek specific performance in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.10_ hereof.

ARTICLE XII

 

MISCELLANEOUS.

 

12.1 _Public Announcements_.

 

Neither Party shall (nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to) issue any
press release or 

 



79  public announcement concerning this Agreement or the Transactions or make
any other public disclosure containing or pertaining to the terms of this
Agreement without obtaining the other Partys prior written approval, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the judgment
of the Party seeking to disclose, disclosure is otherwise required by Law or
by the rules of any stock exchange on which such disclosing Party or its
parent company lists securities, provided that, to the extent any disclosure
is required by Law or stock exchange rule, the Party intending to make such
disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such
Law or stock exchange rule to consult with the other Party with respect to the
timing and text thereof prior to making such disclosure.

 

12.2 _Severability_.

 

In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof,
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full
force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

12.3 _Modification and Waiver_.

 

This Agreement may not be amended or modified in any manner, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties. No waiver by any Party
of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth
in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No waiver by any Party shall
operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or
default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar
or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. The
failure of any Party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision,
or in any way affect the right of such Party thereafter to enforce each and
every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

12.4 _Interpretation_.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the words "include," "includes" and
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation";
(b) the word "or" is not exclusive; and (c) the words "herein," "hereof,"
"hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole. Unless
the context otherwise requires, references herein: (x) to Sections, Schedules
and Exhibits mean the Sections of, and Schedules and Exhibits attached to,
this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other document means such
agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified
from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof and (z) to
a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any
successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. The
terms "provided," "made available" and words of similar import, when used with
respect to any item provided or made available by Seller, shall include any
and all information that has been posted not later than

 



80  three Business Days prior to execution and delivery of this Agreement in the
electronic data room established by Seller in connection with the Transactions
and not removed on or prior to the date of this Agreement. This Agreement
shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring
construction or interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or
causing any instrument to be drafted. The Schedules (including the Seller
Disclosure Schedules) and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with,
and as an integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if they were
set forth verbatim herein.

12.9 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

with, the laws of the State of California without giving effect to its

summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding
relating to the Transactions, for and on behalf of itself or any of its
properties or assets, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.5_, provided that
nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 12.9_ shall affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii)
irrevocably submits itself and its properties and assets to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the trial courts of San Francisco, California or the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of California for the purpose
of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction
Agreements or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation, administration,

to the personal jurisdiction of the trial courts of San Francisco, California

the purpose of any such action, proceeding or counterclaim; (iv) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court; (v) waives any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action, proceeding or
counterclaim in any such court or that such action, proceeding
or counterclaim was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead
or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any action,
proceeding or counterclaim relating to this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such
courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such Parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in

 



82   _Section_ __ _ 12.5_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 12.9(c)_.

 

12.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

Each Party acknowledges and hereby agrees that any breach of this Agreement
would give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be
an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by a Party of any of its
respective covenants, obligations or agreements set forth in this Agreement,
the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by the breaching Party and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement against the breaching Party, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching Party is
entitled at law or in equity, and each Party hereby waives any requirement for
the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. Each
Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other Party and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties under this Agreement.

 

12.11 _Waiver of Conflicts_.

 

Seller has engaged Nixon Peabody LLP ("NP") as its legal counsel in connection
with the Transactions. In the event that NP now or in the future represents
Buyer in connection with matters unrelated to the Transactions, Buyer hereby
(a) consents to the continued representation of Seller or any other Seller
Party by NP in connection with the Transactions, and (b) waives any actual,
potential or alleged conflict of interest that exists or may arise from NPs
representation of any Seller Party in connection with the Transactions,
including with respect to the determination of the Closing Working Capital or
any other adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder, or claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Article XI_ and any Legal Proceeding or other
dispute resolution

 



83  proceedings of any kind in respect of the foregoing. Nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any privilege or consent to the
disclosure of any privileged information. Buyer hereby acknowledges that
Buyer has obtained independent legal advice in connection with the foregoing
consent and waiver.

 

12.12 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one
agreement. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into
in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to
the extent delivered by means of a facsimile, electronic mail or other means
of electronic transmission shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. 

12.13 _Entire Agreement_.

 

This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire
agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject
matter contained herein and therein and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations, representations and statements, whether oral,
written, implied or expressed, relating to such subject matter. In the
event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement and those in the other Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and
Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the
Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement will control.
