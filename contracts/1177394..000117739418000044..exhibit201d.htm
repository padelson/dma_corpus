ARTICLE II. 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 Effect of the Initial Merger on Capital Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Initial Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Subs or any holder of
Company Common Shares or common shares of Merger Sub I:

(i) Common Stock of Merger Sub I. Each common share, par value $0.0001 per
share, of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the
surviving corporation in the Initial Merger. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing the common shares of Merger Sub I shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of common shares of the
surviving corporation in the Initial Merger into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(ii) Cancellation or Conversion of Certain Stock. Each Company Common Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each Company Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held by
Parent or Merger Sub I, other than, in each case, Company Common Shares held
on behalf of third parties, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the "Cancelled Shares"),
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each Company
Common Share that is owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company
or Parent (other than Merger Sub I) ("Converted Shares") shall be
automatically converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) the
Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash
Consideration and the denominator of which is the Parent Closing Price.

(iii) Conversion of Company Common Shares. Each Company Common Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled
Shares, Converted Shares, and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically
converted into (A) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to Section
2.1(d) with respect to fractional shares (the "Stock Consideration") and (B)
the right to receive $13.25 in cash, without interest (the "Cash
Consideration" and, together with the Stock Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration").

All of the Company Common Shares converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated Company Common Shares represented by
book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") and each certificate that,



immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such Company Common
Shares (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (including the right to receive, pursuant to
Section 2.1(d), the Fractional Share Cash Amount), into which the Company
Common Shares represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been
converted pursuant to this Section 2.1.

(b) Shares of Dissenting Shareholders. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (but subject to this Section 2.1(b)), Company Common
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal
for such Company Common Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (such Company Common Shares, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a)(iii), but at the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such holder pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL. If any such holder withdraws its demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal
pursuant to the OGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair cash
value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease, and such Dissenting Shares shall
instead be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii). The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice (but in any event within 48 hours of receipt thereof) of any
demands for appraisal of Company Common Shares received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto.

(c) Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Shares shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; provided, that nothing in this Section
2.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(d) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Initial Merger and no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon
the conversion of Company Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii). Each
holder of Company Common Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive as a result of the Initial Merger a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount (rounded down to the nearest cent)
representing such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the
sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of all such holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock that would otherwise be issued (the "Fractional Share Cash
Amount"). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any
other rights in respect of any



fractional share of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been
issuable as part of the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Appointment of Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and shall enter into an exchange agent agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company relating to the Exchange Agent's responsibilities
under this Agreement.



(b) Deposit of Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares, (i) cash sufficient to pay
the Cash Consideration and (ii) evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry
form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, at Parent's
election) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient
to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration. Parent agrees to deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent from time to time, as needed,
cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.2(e). Any such cash, book-entry shares and certificates deposited
with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to as the "Payment Fund".

(c) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable (and no later than the
third Business Day) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Shares whose Company
Common Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of
Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(d) Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the
transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such
Company Common Shares may be paid to any such transferee if such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(e) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Common Share to
be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(iii) until such holder shall surrender such Company Common Share in
accordance with this Section 2.2. After the surrender in accordance with this
Section 2.2 of a Company Common Share to be converted into Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii), the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive (in addition to the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash
Amount payable to such holder pursuant to this Article II) any such dividends
or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to the Parent Common Stock represented by such
Company Common Share.



(f) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares,
(i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section
2.2(d) (together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or
other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(e)), without interest and (ii) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the surviving corporation in the Initial Merger of Company Common
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing Company Common Shares are presented to the Surviving Company,
Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II,
subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

(g) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its
claim for Merger Consideration (together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount
and any dividends or other distributions) that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this Article II, without any interest thereon.

(h) No Liability. Subject to applicable Law, none of Parent, the Company,
Merger Subs or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Subject to applicable Law, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid
in accordance with this Article II that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent,
Merger Subs and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement,
any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Tax



Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted, withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to Section
2.2(g), Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration (together with the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends or other distributions deliverable in respect
thereof) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase Company Common
Shares (a "Company Option") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested: (i) that has an exercise price per
Company Common Share that is less than the Cash Equivalent Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled by virtue of the Initial Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right
to receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than five Business Days)
following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest and less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment) with respect thereto equal to the
product of (A) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the
excess, if any, of the Cash Equivalent Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Company Common Share subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) that has an exercise price
per Company Common Share greater than or equal to the Cash Equivalent Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
Company Common Shares (a "Company RSU Award"), each performance-based
restricted stock unit award in respect of Company Common Shares (a "Company
PSU Award"), and each deferred stock unit award in respect of Company Common
Shares (a "Company DSU Award") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled by virtue of the Initial Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the
right to receive a cash payment (the "Cash Award Amount") (without interest
and less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment) with respect
thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company RSU Award, Company PSU Award, or Company DSU Award as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (with respect to each Company PSU
Award, such number of shares shall equal the greater of the number of shares
that would be



earned based upon target performance and the number of shares determined in
accordance with the applicable award agreement, with any associated
performance determinations to be made by the Company Board) and (ii) the Cash
Equivalent Merger Consideration (or, if higher, a cash amount equal to the
average of the opening and closing prices per Company Common Share on the New
York Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing
Date). Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.3(b)(i) or 2.3(b)(ii) below,
each Cash Award Amount shall be paid as promptly as practicable (but no later
than five Business Days) following the Effective Time.

(i) Each Cash Award Amount payable in respect of a Company RSU Award or
Company PSU Award that was granted on or after March 31, 2016 (other than any
such Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award that is held by a non-employee
director or that becomes vested at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of
an applicable Contract) will remain unvested as of the Effective Time and
continue to vest and be paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable
award agreement (including the terms relating to accelerated vesting upon a
qualifying termination of employment).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that any
such Company RSU Award, Company PSU Award or Company DSU Award constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the
Cash Award Amount related thereto shall be paid at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a tax
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

Section 2.4 Effect of the Subsequent Merger on Capital Stock. At the effective
time of the Subsequent Merger, by virtue of the Subsequent Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Subs or any holder of
common shares of Merger Sub I or common units of Merger Sub II, each common
share, no par value, of the Company as the surviving corporation in the
Initial Merger issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the Subsequent Merger shall be converted into and become one common unit of
the Surviving Company, and each common unit of Merger Sub II issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Subsequent Merger
shall remain outstanding as a common unit of the Surviving Company.

Section 2.5 Further Assurances. If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Mergers or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Subs, the
Company and the Surviving Company and their respective officers and directors
shall execute and deliver all such instruments, deeds, assignments or
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Mergers and to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement a true and complete copy of Parent's certificate of incorporation

opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, dated the date
of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and

of its Affiliates or any



other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent
or either Merger Sub hereunder.

(b) Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this

whole, will not have incurred Indebtedness beyond their ability to pay such

letter dated as of the date hereof, a true, correct and complete copy of which
has been delivered to the Company (the "Debt Commitment Letter") from the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources
have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide the debt
amounts set forth therein. The financings referred to in the Debt Commitment
Letter are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Debt Financing".

(b) As of the date hereof, the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources to
fund the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to
any conditions precedent or other contingencies, except as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters described below. Except for a

conditions precedent or other contingencies or (ii) could reduce the total

agreements or other arrangements, commitments or understandings with respect
to the Debt Financing.

(c) As of the date hereof and assuming satisfaction or waiver (to the extent

believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and
conditions to be satisfied by it in the Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to
the Closing Date, nor does Parent have knowledge, as of the date of this



Agreement, that any of the Debt Financing Sources will not, or is expected not
to, perform its obligations thereunder.

(d) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, of the other
parties thereto. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other
fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter
on or before the date of this Agreement and will pay in full any such amounts
due on or before the Closing Date.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the receipt or availability
of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt
Financing) by Parent or any Affiliate thereof or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Parent's or either Merger Sub's
obligations hereunder.

have, carried on any business or conducted any operations other than the
execution of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and
matters ancillary thereto and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have,

hereunder and matters ancillary thereto and has, and prior to the effective
time of the Subsequent Merger will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Merger Sub II is, and at the effective time of the Subsequent
Merger will be, treated as a "disregarded entity" of Parent for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

Affiliates or Subsidiaries beneficially owns any Company Common Shares or is,

termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, to its and its
Subsidiaries' personnel, properties, contracts, commitments, books and records
and such other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 5.3(a), any document, correspondence or information
or other access provided pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) may be redacted or
otherwise limited to the extent required to prevent disclosure of information
concerning the valuation of the Company, Parent and the Mergers or other
similarly confidential or competitively sensitive information. All access
pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) shall be (i) conducted in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and (ii) coordinated through the General Counsel of the
Company or a designee thereof.

(b) In the event of (i) an occurrence which would make it reasonably likely
that any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a), Section 6.2(b) or
Section 6.2(c) would not be met or (ii) the Company Board determining in good
faith that it could be entitled to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to Section 5.4(e) or Section 5.4(f) or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(i), and the Company
Board needs such information from the Parent to make such determination, at
the Company's request, Representatives of Parent will meet with
Representatives of the Company and provide the Company with information
reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.3,
neither the Company nor Parent, as applicable, nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide any access, or make available any document,
correspondence or information, if doing so would, in the judgment of its legal
counsel, (i) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
Parent, as applicable, or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) conflict with any
(A) Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the assets, or
operation of the business, of the Company or Parent, as applicable, or any of
its Subsidiaries or (B) Contract to which the Company or Parent, as
applicable, or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
assets or properties are bound; provided, that in such instances the party
withholding access shall inform the other party of the general nature of the
information being withheld and, upon the other party's request, reasonably
cooperate with the other party to provide such information, in whole or in
part, in a manner that would not result in any of the outcomes described in
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).



(d) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed in
accordance with the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of

"Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

Section 5.4 No Solicitation by the Company.

(a) Except as permitted by this Section 5.4, the Company shall not, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and
directors, and shall instruct each of its other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or
facilitate any proposal or offer or any inquiries regarding the making of any
proposal or offer, including any proposal or offer to its shareholders, that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information in
connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any
inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal (other than, in response to an
unsolicited inquiry, to ascertain facts from the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal for the sole purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions
thereof so as to determine whether such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal and to
refer the inquiring Person to this Section 5.4 and to limit its conversation
or other communication exclusively to such referral and such clarifying of
terms as provided herein) or (C) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose
to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document,
agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and direct its
and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and Merger
Subs) that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such person in
possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or its
Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with such Company Takeover Proposal to return or
destroy (and confirm such destruction of) all such information. The Company
shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or confidentiality
provision with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or similar matter in any
agreement to which the Company is a party; provided, that if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive any such
standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to
make a Company Takeover Proposal.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited
written Company Takeover Proposal from any Person that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.4, and if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its
Representatives may (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person that has made such Company Takeover
Proposal and its Representatives (provided, that the Company shall,
substantially concurrently with the delivery to such Person, provide to Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that is provided or made available to such Person or its Representatives
unless such non-public information has been previously provided to Parent) and
(ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company takes any
of the actions in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or any offer, proposal,
inquiry or request for information or discussions relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries that would be reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the Person
making the Company Takeover Proposal or offer, proposal, inquiry or request
and the material terms and conditions thereof. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (but in no event more often
than once every 24 hours), as to the status of (including any material
developments) such Company Takeover Proposal, offer, proposal, inquiry or
request.

(e) Except as permitted by this Section 5.4, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify,
or authorize or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case in any manner
adverse to Parent, or fail to include in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the Company Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend to the shareholders of
the Company, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to
approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company, a Company Takeover
Proposal, (C) fail to recommend against acceptance of any Company Takeover
Proposal that is structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for Company
Common Shares within ten Business Days after commencement of such offer, (D)
fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten Business Days after a
request therefor by Parent following the date any written Company Takeover
Proposal (or any material written modification thereto) is first publicly
disclosed by the Company or the Person making the written Company Takeover
Proposal (provided that Parent may not make such a request more than once for
each Company Takeover Proposal or material modification thereto) or (E) agree
or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any action



described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or
agreement in principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
Section 5.4(c)) (a "Company Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that prior to making
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (I) the Company has given Parent
at least two Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and (II) upon
the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to continue
to be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained,
if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a written
Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, subject to compliance with this
Section 5.4(f), (i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(i) in
order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Superior
Proposal subject to paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 7.3; provided, that prior to so making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, (A) the Company has given
Parent at least four Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to
take such action, including the material terms and conditions of, and the
identity of the Person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has
contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal
and a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements (which version shall
be updated, as applicable, promptly), (B) at the end of such notice period,
the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless
continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed
by Parent were to be given effect, and (C) in the event of any change to any
of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice
consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new
notice period of two Business Days shall commence during which time the
Company shall be



required to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.4(f) anew with
respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (C) above of
this proviso.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (it being understood that
such action may constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for
purposes of Section 5.4(f) and Section 7.1(h) if it otherwise satisfies the
definition thereof) or (ii) from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d‑9(f)
under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.5 Filings; Other Actions.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and each shall
file with the SEC the preliminary Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (ii)
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4 with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Initial Merger, which shall
include the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company
Shareholders' Meeting and Parent Stockholders' Meeting. Each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and Securities Act, and (C)
keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Mergers.

itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other and provide
such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Form S-4. Each of the Company and Parent shall provide the other party
with a reasonable period of time to review the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and any amendments thereto prior to filing and shall
reasonably consider any comments from the other party. Each of the Company and
Parent shall respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall notify the other party promptly of
the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4
or for additional information and shall supply the other party with copies of
all correspondence between it and any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement within 48 hours of the receipt thereof. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and Securities
Act. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders' Meeting or Parent
Stockholders' Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the Company
Shareholders' Meeting or Parent Stockholders' Meeting) any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4, so that the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 would not include a misstatement of a
material



fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed by the Company and/or Parent with the
SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent. The Company shall
cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 to be mailed to the
Company's shareholders, and Parent shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4 to be mailed to Parent's stockholders, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act (such date, the "Clearance Date").

(b) Subject to Section 5.4(f) and Section 5.5(c), the Company shall take all
action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Organizational Documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders following the mailing of the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval (the "Company Shareholders' Meeting") as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Clearance Date. Unless the Company shall
have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with Section
5.4(f), the Company shall include the Company Recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall solicit, and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, the Company Shareholder Approval at the Company
Shareholders' Meeting (including by soliciting proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement) as soon as reasonably practicable.

(c) The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following
the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its shareholders.
The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting (i) to
allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended
disclosure document that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and
disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the Company
Shareholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient Company Common Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Shareholders' Meeting, (iii) if the Company reasonably
determines in good faith that the Company Shareholder Approval is unlikely to
be obtained or (iv) with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by
the Company's shareholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement)
that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the
Company at the Company Shareholders' Meeting.

(d) Subject to Section 5.5(e), Parent shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Organizational Documents to set
a record date for, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders following the mailing of



the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the purpose of obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval (the "Parent Stockholders' Meeting") as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Clearance Date. Parent shall include the
Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall
solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Parent Stockholder
Approval at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (including by soliciting proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement) as soon as reasonably practicable.

(e) Parent shall cooperate with and keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following
the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its stockholders.
Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (i) to allow
time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended
disclosure document that the Parent Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and
disseminated under applicable Law, (ii) if as of the time that the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, (iii) if Parent
reasonably determines in good faith that the Parent Stockholder Approval is
unlikely to be obtained or (iv) with the prior written consent of the Company
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without
the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the approval of the Parent Share Issuance
shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required
by applicable Law to be voted on by Parent's stockholders in connection with
the adoption of this Agreement) that Parent shall propose to be acted on by
the stockholders of Parent at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting.

Section 5.6 Employee Matters.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and during the one-year period
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Company to provide, to each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who was an employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and
who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Company Employees") base compensation and cash incentive compensation
opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than the base
compensation and cash incentive compensation opportunities that were provided
to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time (it being
understood that in the case of cash incentive compensation opportunity, the
underlying performance metrics need not be no less favorable than, or use the
same type of metric as, those provided immediately before the Effective Time,
so long as they are of substantially comparable achievability as determined in
reasonable good faith by Parent as those provided immediately before the
Effective Time).

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and during the eight-month period
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Company to provide, to each Company Employee employee benefits
that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the employee benefits that
were provided to the Company Employee



immediately before the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing
included in this Section 5.6(b) shall prevent Parent from making modifications
to the employee benefits offered to its U.S. employees, including the Company
Employees, at Parent's next open enrollment, which will be effective for the
policy year starting on July 1, 2019. Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to provide, to each Company Employee whose employment is
involuntarily terminated by the Company during the two-year period following
the Effective Time, the severance benefits, if any, that would have been
provided to the Company Employee under the Company's severance arrangements in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Each Company Employee who immediately prior to the Effective Time is then
participating in the Company's Annual Incentive Plans (AIP) (including the
2018 AIP adopted by resolution of the Compensation and Benefits Committee of
the Board) or other non-sales bonus plans for Company Employees at the level
of director and above (collectively, the "Bonus Plans") will be entitled to
receive an annual bonus payment in respect of fiscal year 2018 pursuant to the
terms of the applicable Bonus Plan and of this Section 5.6(c) so long as the
Company Employee remains employed by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof
continuously up to and including December 31, 2018; provided, that a Company
Employee who experiences a severance-qualifying termination of employment
under a severance plan of the Company and its Affiliates (or, in the case of a
Company Employee employed outside of the United States, pursuant to applicable
Law) on or after the Closing and on or before December 31, 2018 will be
entitled to receive the annual bonus payment in respect of fiscal year 2018
that would otherwise be payable to such Company Employee pursuant to the terms
of this Section 5.6(c), prorated to reflect the percentage of 2018 elapsed
through the date of such termination of employment; but, provided, further,
that such prorated payment shall be reduced (but not below zero) by any
prorated bonus in respect of fiscal year 2018 to which the applicable Company
Employee is entitled pursuant to a severance plan of the Company and its
Affiliates (or, in the case of a Company Employee employed outside of the
United States, pursuant to applicable Law). The amount of each bonus payment
shall be based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable
performance goals established under the applicable Bonus Plan in respect of
fiscal year 2018 (with such determination of performance to exclude any costs
relating to the Mergers, as applicable), as determined by Parent in accordance
with the applicable Bonus Plan; provided, however, that (i) a Company
Employee's bonus amount shall be no less than 80% of such Company Employee's
target bonus payment amount, and (ii) in the event that the actual level of
achievement of the applicable performance goals meets or exceeds the target
level of achievement, the target bonus payment shall be increased by 10% of
the amount provided for under the terms of the applicable Bonus Plan. Annual
bonuses for the Company's 2018 fiscal year shall be paid at the same time that
Parent pays annual bonuses in respect of its fiscal year ending November 30,
2018 to its employees, but in no event shall payment be made later than March
15, 2019. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (but
notwithstanding the payment timing set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence), in the event that the Effective Time has not occurred prior to
January 1, 2019, annual bonuses for the Company's 2018 fiscal year will be
determined by the Company in accordance with this Section 5.6(c) as if the
Closing had occurred immediately prior to the conclusion of such fiscal year
and paid by the Company at the time that the Company normally pays annual
bonuses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or,
at the Company's election, immediately prior to the Closing.



(d) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, cause any employee benefit or compensation plans sponsored or
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries in which
the Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Post-Closing Plans") to recognize the service of each
Company Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor
thereto) prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
level of benefits under such Post-Closing Plans; provided, that such
recognition of service shall not apply (i) for purposes of benefit accrual
under any Post-Closing Plan that is a final average pay defined benefit
retirement plan, or (ii) to the extent that such crediting would result in a
duplication of benefits. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides
medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such
Company Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall (A) cause any
preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
plan to be waived with respect to such Company Employee to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (B) credit each Company Employee for any co-payments or deductibles
incurred by such Company Employee in such plan year for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Post-Closing Plan. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any
annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations
that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to
any Company Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement or
who are based outside of the United States, Parent's obligations under this
Section 5.6 shall be in addition to, and not in contravention of, any
obligations under the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement or under the
Laws of the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such
Company Employees are based.

(f) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" of the Company or
other event with similar import, within the meaning of the Company Benefit
Plans that contain such terms, will occur upon the Effective Time.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent. In no event shall the terms of
this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company
Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan, or any "employee benefit plan" as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, the Company
or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and
its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent,
the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Closing Date, or (iii) create any right in any Company Employee or
any other Person to any continued employment with the Surviving Company,
Parent, the Company, or any of their



Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries)
or Affiliates, or otherwise alter any existing at-will employment
relationships between any Company Employee and the Surviving Company.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 5.6 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Company Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 5.7 Regulatory Approvals; Efforts.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Subs and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Mergers as promptly as practicable,
including (i) preparing and filing all forms, registrations and notifications
required to be filed to consummate the Mergers, (ii) using reasonable best
efforts to satisfy the conditions to consummating the Mergers, (iii) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, expiration or termination of a waiting
period, permit, Order or approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity (including furnishing all information and documentary
material required under the HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by
Parent, either Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
in connection with the Mergers or the taking of any action contemplated by
this Agreement, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and (v) the execution and delivery
of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers
and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided, that nothing
in this Section 5.7 and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to (or to
cause any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company to):
(A) sell, license, divest or dispose of or hold separate the assets,
Intellectual Property or businesses of any entity; (B) terminate, amend or
assign any existing relationships or contractual rights or obligations of any
entity; (C) change or modify any course of conduct regarding future operations
of any entity; (D) otherwise take any action that would limit the freedom of
action with respect to, or the ability to retain, one or more businesses,
assets or rights of any entity or interests therein; or (E) commit to take any
such action in the foregoing clause (A), (B), (C) or (D); provided, further,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing proviso, Parent and Merger Sub shall take
the actions in the foregoing clause (A), (B), (C), (D) and/or (E) if such
actions (1) are necessary to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable and in any event before the End Date and (2) would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be have a material
adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger (assuming Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the Merger, were the size of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to giving effect to the Mergers).

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Mergers and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.7. In that regard, prior to the
Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this
Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance
as the other parties may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case
of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) with copies
of) all notices, submissions or filings made by or on behalf of such party or
any of its Affiliates with any Governmental Entity or any other information
supplied by or on behalf of such party or any of its Affiliates to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Mergers. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other
parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with
copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other parties
orally of) any communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the
Mergers, and permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any
proposed communication or submission with any such Governmental Entity. No
party or any of its Affiliates shall participate in any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Mergers unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties
the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 5.7(b) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or
the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.7, materials provided
pursuant to this Section 5.7 may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Company and the Mergers, (ii) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns.

(c) The Company and Parent shall make or file, as promptly as practicable,
with the appropriate Governmental Entity all filings, forms, registrations and
notifications required to be filed to consummate the Mergers under any
applicable Antitrust Law, and subsequent to such filings, the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, as promptly as
practicable, respond to inquiries from Governmental Entities, or provide any
supplemental information that may be requested by Governmental Entities, in
connection with filings made with such Governmental Entities. The Company and
Parent shall file their notification and report forms under the HSR Act no
later than fourteen Business Days after the date of this Agreement. In the
event that the parties receive a request for information or documentary
material pursuant to the HSR Act (a "Second Request"), the parties will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to,
and, if required, certify compliance with, such Second Request as promptly as
practicable, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the
entirety of any such Second Request review process.

(d) If requested by Parent, the Company will agree to any action contemplated
by this Section 5.7; provided, that any such agreement or action is
conditioned on the consummation of the Mergers. Without limiting the
foregoing, in no event will the Company (and the Company will not permit any
of its Affiliates to) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any such actions
without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 5.8 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 5.9 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties and that the
parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public announcement with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided,
that a party may, without the prior



consent of the other party issue such press release or make such public
statement (a) so long as an initial, jointly approved press release has
already been issued and such statements are not inconsistent with previous
statements made jointly by the Company and Parent or (b) (after prior
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) to the extent
required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange;
provided, further, that the Company shall be permitted to issue press releases
or make public announcements with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or
from and after a Company Adverse Recommendation Change without being required
to consult with Parent if in compliance with Section 5.4(f).

Section 5.10 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served
as a director, officer, managing member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the benefit of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, together with such Persons' heirs,
executors and administrators, the "Covered Persons") to the fullest extent
permitted by Law as provided in the Company Organizational Documents or
similar governing documents of the Company's Subsidiaries, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other contracts in
effect on the date of this Agreement and disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the "Indemnification Contracts") against any costs and expenses
(including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Covered
Person to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with
such Persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity
at the request or for the benefit of the Company). Without limiting the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Covered Persons to the fullest extent
permitted by Law as provided in the Company Organizational documents or
similar governing documents of the Company's Subsidiaries, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any Indemnification
Contracts for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the process
resulting in and the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Company shall advance
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the
defense of any Proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters subject
to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.10(a) in accordance with the
procedures (if any) set forth in the Company Organizational Documents, the
certificate or articles of incorporation and code of regulations or bylaws, or
other organizational or governance documents, of any Subsidiary of the
Company, and Indemnification Contracts. In the event of any such Proceeding or
investigation, Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate with the
Covered Person in the defense of any such Proceeding or investigation.



(b) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the limited liability company agreement of
the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to exculpation, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered
Persons for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Organizational Documents. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if any Proceeding or investigation (whether arising before,
at or after the Effective Time) is made against such persons with respect to
matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.10(b)
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding or
investigation. Following the Effective Time, the indemnification agreements,
if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any its Subsidiaries shall be assumed
by the Surviving Company, without any further action, and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
maintain for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time,
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the existing policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; provided, that the Surviving Company shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case
shall purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time
(which the Company shall be permitted to purchase prior to the Effective Time
at a price of no more than 300% of the last annual premium for each year of
coverage), which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage
for an aggregate period of at least six years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to, maintain such policies in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

(e) The obligations under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or
modified in any manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (and their
respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that the Covered
Persons (including their respective



successors and assigns) shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.10. In the event of any breach by the Surviving Company or Parent of this
Section 5.10, the Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable expenses,
including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.10 as
such fees are incurred, upon the written request of such Covered Person.

(f) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall assume all
remaining obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.08 of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Company, Comet Merger Co., SGS
Holdings, Inc. and the Sellers listed on Schedule I thereto, dated January 6,
2014.

Section 5.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company Common Shares (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Shares) and any acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or Parent to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12 Transaction Litigation. Each party shall promptly (and in any
event, within two Business Days) notify the other parties hereto in writing of
any shareholder litigation or other litigation or Proceedings brought or
threatened in writing against it or its directors or executive officers or
other Representatives relating to this Agreement, the Mergers and/or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep the other parties
hereto



informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof
(including by promptly furnishing to the other parties hereto and their
Representatives such information relating to such litigation or proceedings as
may be reasonably requested). Each party shall, subject to the preservation of
privilege and confidential information, give the other parties hereto the
opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense or settlement of
any shareholder litigation or other litigation or Proceeding against it and/or
its directors or executive officers or other Representatives relating to this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall give due consideration to such other parties' advice with
respect to such litigation or proceeding. The Company shall not cease to
defend, consent to the entry of any judgment, settle or offer to settle or
take any other material action with respect to such litigation or proceeding
commenced without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 5.13 Obligations of Merger Subs. Parent shall cause each Merger Sub,
the surviving company in the Initial Merger and the Surviving Company to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 5.14 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration; Stock Exchange Listing.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and, following the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Company, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law
and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to cause the delisting
of the Company and of the Company Common Shares from the New York Stock
Exchange as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Company Common Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after such delisting.

funds within two Business Days of such termination.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that none of the Company Expense
Reimbursement, the Company Termination Fee, or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement is intended to be a penalty but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable,
in the circumstances in which such Company Expense Reimbursement, Company
Termination Fee or Parent Expense Reimbursement is due and payable, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Subs would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to
pay in a timely manner the Company Expense



Reimbursement, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement, as applicable, then the Company shall pay to Parent or Parent
shall pay to the Company, as applicable, interest on such amount from and

have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to
compensate the Company and its shareholders, and that the Company on behalf of
itself and its shareholders shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy
that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary
damages) to enforce specifically Parent's and each Merger Sub's obligations to
consummate the Mergers. The Company's pursuit of specific performance at any
time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to
pursue any other right or remedy to which the Company may be entitled,
including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or
suffered by the Company and its shareholders.
