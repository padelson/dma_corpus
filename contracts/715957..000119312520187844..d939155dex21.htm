in the event of a Q-Pipe Termination, the Base Purchase Price shall equal
$2,736,250,000) _plus_ the Post-Closing Payment Amount (as determined and paid

(i) As promptly as practical, but in no event later than thirty (30) days

(ii) Following Sellers receipt of the Preliminary Post-Closing Payment
Amount, Sellers and their agents, representatives and advisors shall be
permitted to review all books and records, working papers, financial records
and information of Buyer related to the Preliminary Post-Closing Payment
Amount and shall have such access to Buyers personnel as may be reasonably
necessary to permit Sellers to review in detail the manner in which the
Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount was calculated and prepared. Within
thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of the Preliminary Post-Closing
Payment Amount, Sellers shall either:

 



17

    

(A) accept such Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount, in which case (1)
such Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount shall be deemed final and shall
be considered the " _Post-Closing Payment Amount_ " for purposes of this
Agreement and (2) (x) if the Post-Closing Payment Amount is positive, Buyer
shall pay to Sellers, within five (5) days of confirmation of the Post-Closing
Payment Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by Sellers, an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Payment Amount or (y) if the Post-Closing Payment Amount is negative (in
which case, the "Post-Closing Payment Amount" for purposes of this clause (y)
shall be deemed to be equal to the absolute value of such amount), Sellers
shall pay to Buyer, within five (5) days of confirmation of the Post-Closing
Payment Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by Buyer, an amount equal to the Post-Closing Payment
Amount; or

 

(B) dispute such Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount, in which case (1)

an amount equal to the Post-Closing Payment Amount or (y) if the Post-Closing
Payment Amount is negative (in which case, the "Post-Closing Payment Amount"
for purposes of this clause (y) shall be deemed to be equal to the
absolute value of such amount), Sellers shall pay to Buyer, within five (5)
days of confirmation of the Post-Closing Payment Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Buyer, an
amount equal to the Post-Closing Payment Amount.

Section 2.2 Allocation.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers, using and
based upon the best information available to Buyer, an initial allocation
statement (the " _Initial Allocation Statement_ ") reflecting the allocation
of the Base Purchase Price among the Interests including, where applicable, a
further allocation of the Base Purchase Price to any interests in Indirect
Subsidiaries held by a DEI Direct Subsidiary or Dominion Questar Direct
Subsidiary (the " _Initial Allocation_ "). As soon as reasonably practicable,
but no later than thirty (30) days following the receipt of the Initial
Allocation Statement, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a written report
containing any changes that Seller proposes to be made in such schedule (and
specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail).

 



18

    

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the final determination of the Post-Closing
Payment Amount, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a statement (the "
_Final Allocation Statement_ ") reflecting the allocation of the final
Purchase Price, as adjusted to reflect assumed liabilities and other amounts
deemed paid by Buyer for federal income Tax purposes, among the Interests (the
" _Final Allocation_ "). To the extent required by Section 338 or 1060, the
Final Allocation Statement shall include an allocation of that portion of the
adjusted Purchase Price allocated to a DEI Direct Subsidiary or a Dominion
Questar Direct Subsidiary among the separate classes of assets of such entity
(and a further allocation of the Purchase Price attributable to an Indirect
Subsidiary among the assets of such subsidiary) in a manner that is consistent
with the allocation methodology provided by Section 338 or Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be.
Within thirty (30) days following the receipt by Sellers of the Final
Allocation Statement, Sellers shall review the Final Allocation and submit to
Buyer in writing any objections or proposed changes to the Final
Allocation Statement (an " _Objections Notice_ "). Unless Sellers submit an
Objections Notice on or before the expiration of such thirty (30) day period,
the Final Allocation Statement prepared and delivered to Sellers pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ shall be deemed agreed upon by the Parties and
shall be deemed conclusive for purposes of the Final Allocation.

 

(c) If Sellers timely submit an Objections Notice in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.2(b)_, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith and use their
Reasonable Efforts to resolve such dispute. In the event the Parties are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Final Allocation Statement
within twenty (20) days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, neither
Buyer nor Sellers will be bound by the Final Allocation Statement as prepared
by Buyer, and each Party may independently (and in its sole discretion) (i)
determine its own allocation of the Purchase Price between the ownership
interests of each Sale Entity and, with respect to that portion of the
adjusted Purchase Price to be allocated to each Sale Entity, among the
separate classes of assets of such Sale Entity, and (ii) file its Tax Returns
(and Tax Returns of its Affiliates) using alternative allocations of its
choosing.

(d) If the Parties ultimately agree on the Final Allocation Statement, (i)
such Final Allocation Statement shall be amended as, and to the extent, Buyer
and Sellers agree to reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price (as adjusted
to reflect assumed liabilities and other amounts deemed paid by Buyer for
federal income Tax purposes), (ii) except to the extent required to comply
with audit determinations of any Taxing Authority with jurisdiction over a
Party, Buyer and Sellers shall report the Contemplated Transactions for all
required federal Income Tax and all other Tax purposes in a manner consistent
with the Final Allocation, and (iii) no Party shall take any position in any
Tax Return or Tax Proceeding that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation
without the consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Party (or any of its Affiliates) shall be required to litigate before any
court or defend in any administrative proceeding (including any Tax audit or
examination) any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority
challenging such Final Allocation.

 



19

    

Section 2.3 Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any
amounts that are required to be deducted or withheld under any provision of
applicable Law, and any amount so deducted or withheld will be remitted by
Buyer to the applicable Taxing Authority, and shall be treated, for purposes
of this Agreement, as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the
deduction or withholding was made. Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to
notify the applicable Seller before making any such deduction or withholding.

thereunder, applicable to such Applicable SEC Documents, and none of the
Applicable SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended, the

and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the

Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information required to be disclosed by the Reporting
Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Reporting Companys management as

Regulatory Filings complied, as of their respective dates, with all
applicable requirements of the applicable Laws, except for Regulatory Filings

with all applicable requirements of the applicable Laws have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Entity that is not a Significant Subsidiary holds, and is in compliance with,

after the Closing Date; and

(h) none of the Sale Entities has been a party to any

plans, whether or not subject to ERISA and whether covering one person or

with respect to Company Employees or to which Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate
contributes on behalf of Company Employees (hereafter " _Employee Plans_ ").

(b) All Employee Plans subject to ERISA and the Code comply with ERISA,
the Code and, as applicable, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, the Family and Medical Leave
Act of 1993, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,
except such non-compliance as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) All Employee Plans contributed to by a Sale Entity or any ERISA Affiliate
intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code have filed for or
received favorable determination letters with respect to such qualified status
from the Internal Revenue Service. The determination letter for each such
Employee Plan remains in effect, and, to Sellers Knowledge, any amendment
made, or event relating to such an Employee Plan subsequent to the date of
such determination letter, has not materially and adversely affected the
qualified status of the Employee Plan.

 

(d) No Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a " _Title IV Plan_
") or Section 430 of the Code is considered "at-risk", within the meaning of
Section 430(i)(4) of the Code, and to Sellers Knowledge, no condition exists
which would be expected to result in an Employee Plan becoming "at-risk" as
of the last day of the current plan year of any Title IV Plan or other
Employee Plan subject to Section 430 of the Code. The PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan, and no other event or condition
has occurred which might constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for
the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such
Title IV Plan.

 

(e) Other than the UWUA Health and Welfare Fund referenced in _Section_ __ _

withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan.

(1/2) by Sellers. Buyer shall file, to the extent required by applicable Tax
Laws, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes. To the extent required by applicable Tax Laws, Sellers or
any of their Affiliates will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or
other documentation. The party not making that payment of Transfer Taxes
to the Governmental Authority shall pay its share of such Transfer Taxes
within five (5) days after demand therefor (which demand may be made before
the payment of Taxes to a Governmental Authority) by the paying party.

 

(b) Any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.3(b)_ shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices
followed in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except for
changes required by changes in applicable Tax Laws or changes in fact
(including the Section 338(h)(10) Election). Buyer shall not, and shall not
cause or permit the Sale Entities or any of Buyers Affiliates to, (i) amend,
refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return with respect to any of the Sale
Entities for any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or prior to
the Closing Date, or (ii) enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax
claim or assessment relating to any Sale Entity, surrender any right to claim
a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to any Sale Entity for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, or take any other similar action relating to the
filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, in each instance without
obtaining the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent may be withheld
in Sellers sole discretion. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the Parties for certain Tax matters
following the Closing Date:

(i) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Income Tax Returns and all Non-Income Tax Returns for any of the
Sale Entities for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods regardless of when they are to
be filed. With respect to Non-Income Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date,
Sellers

 



35

    

 shall deliver to Buyer for its review and comment a copy of such Non-Income
Tax Returns for its review as soon as reasonably possible. Sellers
shall reasonably consider any comments provided by Buyer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event Sellers and Buyer disagree with respect to any Non-
Income Tax Return prepared by Sellers pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)(i)_, Sellers may file such Non-Income Tax Return reflecting the
position Sellers determine, in their sole discretion, to be appropriate unless
a different position is required by applicable Law. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iii)_), Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid on each
of the Sale Entities behalf, the Taxes payable by each of the Sale Entities
with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, except to the extent of (A) Taxes
that became due as any breach of any covenant, representation, warranty,
undertaking or other obligation imposed on Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to
this Agreement (including, for this purpose, any of the Sale Entities) on or
after the Closing Date and (B) the portion of any Transfer Taxes for which
Sellers are not responsible pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, and if
Sellers pay Taxes described in clause (A) or (B) on behalf of the Sale
Entities or Buyer, the Sale Entities or Buyer shall reimburse Sellers
therefor within fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Taxes are paid.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers shall
have sole discretion and control over any and all Income Tax Returns
required to be filed by or in respect of a Sale Entity for a taxable period
or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(ii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Non-Income Tax Returns of the Sale Entities for Tax periods that begin
before or on the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "). Buyer shall deliver to Sellers Tax Returns pertaining to the
Straddle Period for Sellers review at least fifteen (15) days before the date
on which such Tax Return is required to be filed, or as soon as reasonably
possible if the Tax Return is required to be filed within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date. Sellers shall review such Tax Returns within ten
(10) days after the delivery of such Tax Returns. Sellers will be deemed to
have approved such Tax Returns as prepared by Buyer if they fail to submit
comments within such ten (10) day review period. If Sellers deliver comments
to Buyer within such ten (10) day review period, Buyer and Sellers shall use
good faith efforts to resolve any dispute in connection with such comments.
In the event Buyer and Sellers are unable to agree on any such revisions
within ten (10) days after Sellers provide their comments, Buyer and Sellers
shall engage the Independent Auditor to resolve the matter, and the
Independent Auditors determination shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The Independent Auditor shall resolve the dispute within twenty (20)
days after the item has been referred to it. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(ii)_, Buyer shall be entitled to
file on behalf of the Sale Entities, or cause to be filed, the applicable Tax
Return without having incorporated Sellers proposed changes if necessary to
avoid a late filing of such Tax Return. If the Independent Auditors
resolution of the dispute necessitates the amendment of a Tax Return filed in
accordance with the previous sentence, then Buyer shall cause an amended Tax
Return to be filed that reflects such resolution. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Auditor shall be borne by each Party in the percentage
inversely proportionate to the percentage of the total items submitted for
dispute that are resolved in such Partys favor.

 



36

    

(iii) Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer within fifteen (15)
days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to a Straddle Period
an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes, if any, which relates to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date, after taking into
account any prepayments or deposits made by or on behalf of a Sale Entity on
or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall have
no liability or obligation to pay any Taxes becoming due as a result of any
breach of any covenant, representation, warranty, undertaking or other
obligation imposed on Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement
(including, for this purpose, any of the Sale Entities) on or after the
Closing Date. For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iii)_, in the case
of any Taxes that are imposed and are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending as
of the Closing Date shall, in the case of any Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis (such as real property Taxes), be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period.
In the case of non-periodic Taxes (i.e., such as Taxes that are (w) based upon
or related to income or receipts, (x) imposed in connection with any capital
or debt restructuring, (y) imposed in connection with any sale, distribution,
or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), or (z) payroll, withholding, excise and similar Taxes), the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on
the Closing Date shall be determined based on a closing of the books of the
Sale Entities at the end of the Closing.

 

(iv) Sellers and Buyer agree that, except with respect to Tax incurred by
Sellers upon the sale of the Interests to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
Buyer shall be responsible for all Taxes incurred by or with respect to the
Sale Entities, whether resulting from the assets or operations of the Sale
Entities or otherwise, for all Tax periods beginning after the Closing Date
(including the portion of any Straddle Period beginning immediately after the
Closing Date) to the extent attributable to the direct or indirect interest
acquired by Buyer. In the event Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iv)_ are reduced because of Tax payments made by
Sellers or a Sale Entity on or before the Closing Date (whether through
deposits, prepayments, credits, or otherwise), Buyer shall reimburse Sellers
therefor within five (5) days after the date on which Buyer realizes the
benefit of the reduction.

(c) Each Party shall provide the other Parties with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by the other Parties in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any
Governmental Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings
relating to liability for Taxes, and each will retain

 



37

    

 and provide the requesting Party with any records or information which may
be relevant to such return, audit or examination, proceedings or
determination. Any information obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_
or pursuant to any other Sections hereof providing for the sharing of
information relating to or review of any Tax Return or other schedule relating
to Taxes shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) Except as otherwise provide herein, in the case of any audit, examination,
or other proceeding (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to (i) any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to any other
Tax period ending after the Closing Date for which Sellers are or may
be liable for any Taxes pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall inform
Sellers in writing of such Tax Proceeding within ten (10) days after the
receipt by Buyer of written notice thereof. In the event Buyer fails to timely
provide Sellers with written notice of such Tax Proceeding, Sellers
obligation to indemnify Buyer or its Affiliates hereunder shall be reduced to
the extent of any Adverse Consequences arising as a result of such failure to
notify. Buyer shall afford Sellers, at Sellers expense, the opportunity to
control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall have the right, at Buyers expense, to attend and participate in
such Tax Proceeding, but only to the extent such Tax Proceeding pertains to a
Sale Entity and does not involve Sellers or any of their Affiliates. If
Sellers elect not to control the conduct of any such Tax Proceeding, Buyer
shall control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding at Buyers expense, and
Sellers shall have the right (at Sellers expense) to attend and participate
in such Tax Proceeding. Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall settle or compromise
such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the other,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers
shall have the sole right to control, settle, and compromise all Tax
Proceedings related to Income Taxes of a Sale Entity for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and Buyer shall have no right to participate to attend or participate
in any such Tax Proceeding, or to receive copies of any correspondence or
other information related to any Tax Proceeding to the extent such Tax
Proceeding, correspondence, or other information includes or pertains to
Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

 

(e) To the extent that a Sale Entitys liability for Taxes for a taxable year
or portion ending on or before the Closing Date (as computed in a manner
consistent with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iii)_, and after giving effect to any
Tax credits or Tax abatements) is less than the amount of estimated Taxes paid
by or on behalf of such Sale Entity with respect to all or a portion of such
taxable year or period, Buyer shall pay Sellers the difference within two (2)
days of filing the relevant Tax Return that reflects such Tax.

 

(f) Without duplication of amounts payable to Sellers pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, any refund of Taxes paid or payable by or with respect
to the Sale Entities, shall be paid within two (2) Business Days of receipt as
follows, or to the extent payable but not paid due to offset against other
Taxes shall be paid by the Party receiving the benefit of the offset within
two (2) Business Days of such offset as follows: (i) to Sellers if
attributable to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date, or for any Straddle Period to the extent allocable, determined
in a manner consistent with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iii)_, to the portion of
such Tax period beginning before and ending on the

 



38

    

 Closing Date; and (ii) to Buyer if attributable to any Tax period or portion
thereof beginning after the Closing Date or for any Straddle Period to the
extent allocable, determined in a manner consistent with _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)(iii)_, to the portion of such Tax period beginning after the Closing
Date. Buyer shall cooperate, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and the
Sale Entities to cooperate, in obtaining any Tax refund that Sellers
reasonably believes should be available, including through filing appropriate
forms with the applicable Taxing Authority.

 

(g) Except as provided otherwise herein, none of the Sale Entities shall take,
and none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall permit or otherwise allow
any of the Sale Entities to take, any action on the Closing Date that is not
in the ordinary course of the Sale Entities businesses, including, but not
limited to, the merger or liquidation of any of the Sale Entities or the
distribution of any property in respect of any of the Sale Entities stock,
partnership interests or membership interests, without the prior written
consent of Sellers, which consent may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion.
For this purpose, an action taken effective as of the Closing Date shall be
treated as having been taken on the Closing Date.

 

(h) Except as required by Law, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
(or shall cause or permit any of the Sale Entities to) take any action which
could (A) increase Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) liability for Taxes
(including any liability of Sellers to indemnify Buyer for Taxes pursuant to
this Agreement) or (B) result in, or change the character of, any income or
gain that Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) must report on any Income Tax
Return.

(i) All Tax sharing agreements or arrangements that provide for the
allocation, apportionment, sharing, or assignment of Tax liability between any
of the Sale Entities and Sellers or Sellers Affiliates shall be terminated as
of the Closing Date.

 

(j) _Election Under Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10)_.

 

(i) Sellers and Buyer shall make, or cause to be made, a timely and effective
joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under any applicable
similar provisions of state or local law with respect to the purchase of the
interests in each Sale Entity specified by Buyer (all such elections being
referred to collectively as the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_").

(ii) Buyer shall prepare Internal Revenue Service Form 8023, required
schedules thereto and any similar forms necessary to effectuate the Section
338(h)(10) Election under applicable state and local laws (collectively,
the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election Forms_"). Seller shall cooperate
with Buyer in the preparation of the Section 338(h)(10) Election Forms and
shall deliver duly completed, executed copies thereof on the Closing Date.
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other and take all actions
necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional forms, Tax
Returns, elections, schedules, and other documents as may be required) to
effect and preserve the Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with Section
338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and comparable
provisions of applicable state and local Tax laws and shall take no
action inconsistent therewith except to the extent required pursuant to a
"determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar
provision of any state, foreign or local law.

Section 5.5 Notice of Changes. From the Effective Date until the Closing,
each Party shall promptly advise the other Parties in writing with respect to
any fact, event or circumstance that arises after the Effective Date of which
such Party obtains knowledge and which, if existing or occurring at
the Effective Date and not set forth in this Agreement or any of the
Schedules, would have constituted a breach of a representation or warranty of
such Party contained in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ , as the case may be,
such that the closing condition in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or _Section_ __ _
7.2_, as the case may be, cannot be satisfied. Any actions of the Sale
Entities or JV Companies occurring following the Effective Date which are
required or permitted by this Agreement, including Actions permitted or
consented to by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ shall automatically
be deemed to amend and update any appropriate Schedule solely with respect to
the representations and warranties of the Sellers and such amendment shall
not be subject to, or included in, any determination of whether the provisions
of _Sections 6.2_ or _9.1(c)_ have been satisfied or are applicable;
_provided_ , that such action does not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
In the event of a Q-Pipe Termination, Sellers shall be permitted to amend and
update any and all appropriate Schedules to reflect the exclusion of the
Q-Pipe Companies from the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 5.6 Employee Matters. 

(a) Buyer shall cause all Company Employees (other than Sale Entity Employees)
to receive a Post-Closing Offer at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, with each such offer to be contingent and effective upon the

(b) With respect to Transferred Employees who are covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement on the Closing Date (" _Transferred Union Employees_ "),
Buyer will cause the Post-Closing Employer to assume the Collective Bargaining
Agreement as of the Closing Date, and to continue to abide by the terms and
conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement for periods after the
Closing Date with respect to such Transferred Union Employees, including

Buyers proportionate share of each such contribution shall equal 73%.

(c) With respect to Transferred Employees who are not covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement as of the Closing Date (" _Transferred Non-Union
Employees_"), commencing on the Closing Date and continuing through the date
that is twenty four (24) months following the Closing Date (the "

immediately prior to the Closing, based on his or her years of service with
both DEI and its Affiliates and Buyer and its Affiliates before and after the
Closing, (2) defined-benefit pension benefits in accordance with _Section_

obligations with respect to any "Transferring Employees" as defined in the
Stock Purchase Agreement between Southern Company and Dominion Modular LNG
Holdings, Inc., through the end of the Continuation Period described therein

locations (as set forth in _Schedule 5.6(c)_ ) during the Continuation Period.

 

(d) DEI shall cause any long-term incentive award granted to a Company
Employee under a DEI long-term incentive plan (a " _DEI LTI Award_ ") to vest
on a pro-rata basis on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of such
plan, based on the period from the start of the vesting or performance
period applicable to such award through the applicable Closing Date. With
respect to each DEI LTI Award of a Transferred Non-Union Employee that is pro-
rated in accordance with the preceding sentence, Buyer shall cause the
applicable Post-Closing Employer to grant to each such Transferred Non-Union
Employee a long-term incentive award under the Post-Closing Employers long-

the grant-date target value of the DEI LTI Award, pro-rated for such period.
In addition, during the Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause the applicable
Post-Closing Employer to continue to grant annual awards under its long-term
incentive plan for eligible non-officer Transferred Non-Union Employees on

than fifty (50) miles from the individuals work location immediately prior to
the Closing, or (iii) such Transferred Non-Union Employee resigns after being
offered a position with base pay or target annual cash bonus that is less than

classified by DEI as an officer (Vice President or above) with: (i) annual
grants (such grants occurring at the time annual long-term incentive grants
are made generally by Buyer) of long-term incentive awards under the Post-
Closing Employers long-term incentive plan on terms that are comparable to
the terms of DEIs long-term incentive program for officers as of the date
hereof (the " _DEI LTI Program_ ") and with target grant-date values of awards
for each such eligible Transferred Non-Union Employee that are no less than
the target grant-date value of the most recent award received by the
Transferred Non-Union Employee under the DEI LTI Program prior to the Closing
Date; (ii) executive perquisites (including leased vehicle, financial planning
and health and wellness reimbursement) no less than his or her executive
perquisites immediately prior to the Closing; (iii) continuation of premium
payments under his or her universal life insurance policy in accordance with
DEIs program as in effect as of the date hereof; and (iv) supplemental
retirement benefits that mirror DEIs Benefit Restoration Plan as in effect as
of the date hereof. In addition, for any Transferred Non-Union Employee who
has entered into an Employment Continuity Agreement or other similar change-

Employer to assume each such agreement as of the Closing Date and to keep such
agreement in effect for the duration of the Continuation Period.

 

(g) As of the Closing Date, all Transferred Non-Union Employees shall, if
applicable, be eligible to participate in and, if elected, shall commence
participation in the employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA), programs, policies, contracts, fringe benefits, or
arrangements (whether written or unwritten), including, but not limited to,
the tax-qualified defined benefit plan (" _Post-Closing Salaried Pension Plan_
"), defined contribution plan, retiree medical plan and retiree life plan, of
the applicable Post-Closing Employer or its Affiliate (collectively, " _Post-
Closing Employee Plans_ "). Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing Employer, to
the extent permissible under any Post-Closing Employee Plan (provided that
Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing Employer to use Reasonable Efforts to
remove any restrictions including restrictions in any insurance policy), to
waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to Transferred Non-Union Employees and their spouses and
dependents, if applicable, under the Post-Closing Employee Plans. Buyer shall
cause each Post-Closing Employer, to the extent permissible under any Post-
Closing Employee Plan (provided that Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing

(h) During the Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing
Employer to provide a Post-Closing Salaried Pension Plan that provides a
level of pension benefits that is not lower than such level of pension
benefits for the Transferred Non-Union Employees as of the Closing Date using
the applicable pension benefit formula provided in the Dominion Energy
Pension Plan. Each Transferred Non-Union Employees benefit under the
applicable Post-Closing Salaried Pension Plan shall be at least equal to (A)
minus (B), where: (A) equals the total accrued pension benefit for such
Transferred Non-Union Employee under the Post-Closing Salaried Pension Plan,

 



45

    

 calculated as of such Transferred Non-Union Employees retirement or
termination date from the Post-Closing Employer and its Affiliates, taking
into account service credit and compensation earned from the Post-Closing
Employer, DEI or an ERISA Affiliate through the Closing Date, plus service
credit and compensation earned under the Post-Closing Salaried Pension Plan
from the Closing Date until such Transferred Non-Union Employees retirement
or termination date; and (B) equals the accrued normal retirement benefit of
such Transferred Non-Union Employee under the Dominion Energy Pension Plan as
of the Closing Date. DEI will provide all necessary earnings history and
information required to calculate the benefit under Part A and B of the
formula as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date.

(i) During the Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause the Post-Closing
Employer to provide a level of retiree medical and life insurance benefits to
each Transferred Non-Union Employee hired by Buyer and its Affiliates before
October 1, 2015 not lower than the level of retiree medical and life
insurance benefits available to each such Transferred Non-Union Employee
immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(j) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Sale Entity shall cease to be a
participating employer in all Employee Plans sponsored by DEI or any ERISA
Affiliate. All Company Employees shall cease to be active participants in all
Employee Plans sponsored by DEI or any ERISA Affiliate and shall cease to
accrue additional benefits under such plans for any periods from and after
the Closing Date.

(k) Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing Employer to accept or cause to be
accepted transfers from DEIs or any ERISA Affiliates flexible spending
account plan of each Transferred Employees account balances as of the Closing
Date and credit such employee with such amounts under the applicable Post-
Closing Employee Plan. On and after the Closing Date, Transferred Employees
shall have no further claim for reimbursement under flexible spending account
plans sponsored by DEI or any ERISA Affiliate and all claims must be submitted
under the applicable Post-Closing Employee Plan, including expenses incurred
prior to the Closing Date.

(l) Buyer shall cause to be provided to each Transferred Employee credit for
prior service with DEI or any ERISA Affiliate for all purposes (including
vesting, eligibility, benefit accrual or level of benefits) in all Post-
Closing Employee Plans, including fringe benefit plans, vacation and sick
leave policies, severance plans or policies, retiree medical plans and
retirement plans maintained or provided by the applicable Post-Closing
Employer or its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date.

(m) Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing Employer to provide each Transferred
Employee credit for all of the Transferred Employees earned but unused
vacation and sick leave and other time-off as of the Closing Date as
determined under time-off policies maintained by DEI or its Affiliate, as
applicable.

 



46

    

(n) To the extent allowable by law, Buyer shall take any and all
necessary action to cause the trustee of a defined contribution plan of Buyer
or one of its Affiliates, if requested to do so by a Transferred Employee, to
accept a direct "rollover" of all or a portion of such employees distribution
from a defined contribution plan maintained by DEI or any ERISA Affiliate
(excluding securities, but including plan loans) if such Transferred Employee
elects such direct rollover within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date.

 

(o) As of the Closing, DEI or each ERISA Affiliate shall take all necessary
action to cause the defined contribution plans maintained by DEI or such
ERISA Affiliate to fully vest the Company Employees in their account balances
under such defined contribution plans.

 

(p) With respect to each Company Employee (including any beneficiary or the
dependent thereof), DEI or each ERISA Affiliate shall retain all liabilities
and obligations arising under any medical, dental, vision, life insurance or
accident insurance benefit plans sponsored by DEI or such ERISA Affiliate to
the extent that such liability or obligation relates to claims incurred
(whether or not reported or paid) prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(p)_, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred (i) with
respect to medical, dental and vision benefits, on the date that the medical,
dental or vision services giving rise to such claim are performed, (ii) with
respect to life insurance, on the date that the death occurs, and (iii) with
respect to accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident
insurance, on the date that the accident occurs.

(q) With respect to each Company Employee who is not actively at work and who

leave or vacation pay), DEI or each ERISA Affiliate shall be responsible for
any such payments due prior to the Closing Date and Buyer or the applicable
Post-Closing Employer shall be responsible for any payments due on or after

to workers compensation benefits.

(r) DEI and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all workers
compensation liabilities and obligations for Company Employees or other
former employees of the Sale Entities to the extent such liabilities and
obligations relate to events which occurred prior to the Closing. Buyer shall
assume all workers compensation liabilities and obligations for Company
Employees or other former employees of the Sale Entities to the extent such
liabilities and obligations relate to events which occur on or after the
Closing.

 

(s) Effective as of the Closing Date, DEI or each ERISA Affiliate shall be
responsible for providing coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (" _COBRA_ ") to any Company Employee, his or her spouse or
dependent person as to whom a "qualifying event" as defined in Section 4980B
of the Code has occurred prior to the Closing Date.

 



47

with respect to a Sale Entity at any time on or after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall be solely responsible for providing all notices required under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. §2109 et seq. or

Dominion Marks and use of the "Dominion" or "Questar" name in any form
whatsoever. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any direct or indirect costs

Entities use any trademarks, service marks, brand names or trade, corporate or
business names which are owned by Sellers (or any of their Affiliates other

Entity (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ")
against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
(each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission relating to their position with any
Sale Entity occurring or alleged to have occurred before or on the Closing
Date (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to this Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under

by Buyer; _provided, however_ , that, after the Closing, Buyer shall not be
required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Reporting Company in respect of the coverage required to
be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage
as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided, further_ , that in lieu
of the foregoing insurance coverage, Buyer may purchase "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount which Buyer would be
required to spend during the sixyear period provided for in this _Section_
__ _ 5.11(b)_, that provides coverage not materially less favorable than the
coverage described above to the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Reporting Company as of the date hereof with
respect to matters arising on or before the Closing.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives from and after the Closing, and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Buyer and the Sale Entities under this _Section_
__ _ 5.11_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section_ __ _
5.11_ applies unless (A) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,

the Reporting Company shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_.

 

Section 5.12 Insurance. Sellers shall maintain or cause to be maintained in
full force and effect the Insurance Policies until the Closing, including by
maintaining each applicable Sale Entity as insureds. Without limiting the
rights of Buyer set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, if any claims are made
or Adverse Consequences occur or are suffered prior to the Closing Date that
relate to any of the Sale Entities, and such claims, or claims associated with
such Adverse Consequences, may be made against the Insurance Policies, then
Sellers shall use their Reasonable Efforts to ensure that after the Closing
Date Sellers, on behalf of Buyer, can file, notice and otherwise continue to
pursue such claims and recover proceeds under the terms of such policies, and,
provided that Buyer promptly reimburses Sellers for Sellers costs and out of

 



53

    

 pocket expenses incurred in performing such obligations, Sellers agree to
cooperate in good faith with Buyer or its Affiliates to make the benefits of
any Insurance Policies available to Buyer or its Affiliates and use

Operation and Maintenance Agreement dated as of September 2, 2014 by and

_COMA_ ") to a DEI Affiliate that is not a Sale Entity. Pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the Transition Services Agreement, following the Closing,
Buyer shall make available those Company Employees that, prior to the Closing,
performed obligations under the COMA to allow such Company Employees to
continue to perform such obligations, in each case, to the extent such Company
Employees are employed by Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Sale
Entities).

that (a) ACP has received all applicable operating certificates from the

provided that, via a combination of the Transition Services Agreement and a
long term license, lease or similar agreement that would become effective
following the termination of the Transition Services Agreement, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, DEI shall provide, or cause its
Affiliate to provide, the applicable Sale Entity with continued access, rights
and privileges with respect to the Excluded Telecom Assets reasonably
necessary for such Sale Entity to continue to operate and conduct in all
material respects its business (as it pertains to the Excluded Telecom Assets)
consistent with past practices and as currently conducted. Such services
provided by DEI and its Affiliates shall be at an overall net cost that is
not intended to exceed the costs such Sale Entity would have incurred if it
continued to own the Excluded Telecom Assets in its own name.

 



54

    

(b) To the extent Sellers, despite Reasonable Efforts, are unable
to effectuate the transfer of one or more Excluded Telecom Assets to a DEI

to provide, or cause the applicable Sale Entity to continue to provide, DEI
and its Affiliates that are not Sale Entities with continued access, rights
and privileges to such assets following Closing until such transfer occurs,
and (ii) Buyer shall, in good faith and using Reasonable Efforts at the

_Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, _Section_ __

58

    

 extend the Termination Date pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(i)_ if
it is in breach of any of its covenants or agreements and such breach has
primarily caused or resulted in either (1) the failure to satisfy the
conditions to its obligations to consummate the Closing set forth in _Article
VI_ or _Article VII_ , as applicable, prior to the Termination Date or (2) the
failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to the Termination Date; or

(ii) if any Law having the effect set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6._1 or
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ shall not have been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set
aside, annulled or suspended and shall be in full force and effect and, in the
case of any ruling, decree, judgment, injunction or order of any Governmental
Authority (each, a " _Restraint_ "), shall have become final and non-
appealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a Party if
the issuance of such final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement,
including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.2_.

(c) by Buyer, if Sellers shall have breached or failed to perform any of
their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2 _or _Section_ __ _
6.3_, respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Sellers by the Termination Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
days following receipt of written notice from Buyer stating Buyers intention
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ and the
basis for such termination; provided that Buyer shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ if it is
then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or other agreements hereunder;

 

(d) by Sellers, if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _Section_ __ _
7.3_, respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Buyer by the Termination Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
days following receipt of written notice from Sellers stating Sellers

9.1(d)_ and the basis for such termination; _provided_ that, Sellers shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)_ if it is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder; or

(e) by Sellers, solely with respect to the Q-Pipe Companies pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)(vii)_, provided that Sellers shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ if
Sellers are then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements hereunder; and provided Buyer shall have paid
the Q-Pipe Termination Fee.

 



59

    

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ (except for a Q-Pipe Termination
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_, which is expressly addressed in 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_), written notice thereof shall be given to the other
Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and have no further force or effect (other than, this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_
and _Article XI_ , all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement),
and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party or their
respective directors, officers, other representatives or Affiliates, whether
arising before or after such termination, based on, arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter
hereof (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity); _provided, however_ ,
that no Party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages
arising out of any material breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination that gave rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Article
VI_ or _Article VII_ , as applicable. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive in accordance with its terms following termination of this Agreement.

Section 9.3 Effect of Q-Pipe Termination. In the event of a Q-Pipe
Termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_, (i) each Q-Pipe Company shall
be excluded from the Contemplated Transactions and Sellers shall, prior to

ARTICLE X

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 10.1 Indemnification.

 

(a) _Indemnification by Sellers_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article X_ , from and after the Closing, each Seller, jointly and severally,
shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and each of
their respective stockholders, members, partners, managers, officers,
directors, employees, consultants, agents and representatives (the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ "), from any and all Adverse Consequences actually
incurred or paid by a Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in _Article III_ of this
Agreement, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Sellers contained
in this Agreement, or (iii) the Retained Liabilities.

 

(b) _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article X_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective
stockholders, members, partners, managers, officers, directors, employees,
consultants, agents and representatives (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_
"), from any and all Adverse Consequences actually incurred or paid by a
Seller Indemnified Party as a result of (i) any breach of any representation
or warranty of Buyer contained in _Article IV_ of this Agreement, (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement, or
(iii) any liability with respect to the Sale Entities and JV Companies,
including those that may be incurred by Sellers, whether arising before, on

60

    

Section 10.2 Procedure for Indemnification. Each claim for indemnification,
including those claims resulting from the assertion of liability by Persons
not parties to this Agreement, including claims by any Governmental Authority
for penalties, fines and assessments, must be made by delivery by the Party
to be indemnified (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to the Party responsible for
the indemnification obligation (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of written
notice containing details reasonably sufficient to disclose to the
Indemnifying Party the nature and scope of the claim including an estimate of
the amount of claimed Adverse Consequences and copies of all relevant
pleadings, documents and information within ten (10) Business Days after the
Indemnified Partys knowledge of such claim. Any failure in the delivery of
such notice shall not affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party, except
to the extent that the rights and remedies of the Indemnifying Party are
adversely affected or prejudiced as a result of the failure to give, or delay
in giving, such notice. In the event that any Action is brought against an
Indemnified Party for which the Indemnifying Party may be required to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Action shall be defended by
the Indemnifying Party and such defense shall include all appeals or reviews.
The Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement of any claims without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, _provided_ , _however_ , that
such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement does not involve any
finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing
by the Indemnified Party, (ii) the sole relief is monetary damages, which the
Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement, (iii) the settlement involves a full
release of the claim and (iv) the settlement does not encumber any of the
assets of any Indemnified Party or impose any restriction or condition that
would apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party withholds its consent unreasonably, the Indemnified Party
shall be obligated for any future expenses and excess settlement amounts. The
Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate at its expense in connection with the
defense of any such claims including, without limitation, reasonable access
to the Indemnified Partys records and personnel relating to such claim, and
will have the right to participate in the defense of any claim by counsel of
its own choosing and at its own expense. 

Section 10.3 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6)
months after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ (Tax Matters)
shall survive the Closing until the sixtieth (60th) day after expiration of
the statute of limitations period applicable thereto, and (ii) the Fundamental
Representations (other than _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_, which shall survive for a
period of two (2) years after the Closing Date) shall survive the Closing for
a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date. The covenants and
agreements of the Parties to be performed or complied with prior to the
Closing shall survive the Closing for a period of ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date and those covenants and agreements of the Parties that by their
terms are to be performed or complied with after the Closing shall survive for
a period of thirty (30) days after their expiration in accordance with their
terms. No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability for any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(b)_ by an
Indemnified Party hereunder unless the

 



61

    

 Indemnified Party notifies such Indemnifying Party of such claim in writing,
setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of the claim on or before the
expiration of the time periods provided in the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_; _provided_ that if no notice of a claim for
indemnification made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(b)_ has
been made within the time periods set forth above in this _Section_ __ _
10.3_, then such claim for indemnification shall be waived.

 

Section 10.4 Exclusivity. Following the Closing, except for actual fraud or
willful misconduct, the rights and remedies of Sellers and the Seller
Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, on the other hand, for damages under this _Article X_ are, solely as
between Sellers and the Seller Indemnified Parties on the one hand, and Buyer
and the Buyer Indemnified Parties on the other hand, exclusive and in lieu of
any and all other rights and remedies for damages which Sellers and the Seller
Indemnified Parties on the one hand, and Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties on the other hand, may have under this Agreement or under applicable
Laws with respect to the Contemplated Transactions, including any breach of
this Agreement, warranty, tortious conduct or otherwise, and whether at common
law, statute, strict liability, equity, or otherwise, and each Party agrees
to waive to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claims or
rights with respect thereto unless specifically provided for in this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may bring an
Action to enforce this _Article X_.

 

Section 10.5 Limitation of Claims; Mitigation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein:

(a) Except with respect to claims for breaches of  _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ (Tax
Matters) (each, a " _Tax Representation_ ") and the Retained Liabilities, the
maximum aggregate liability of Sellers under this Agreement shall not exceed
an amount equal to the Base Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to indemnification obligations of Sellers under
_Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)(i)_ (other than with regard to any breaches of any
of Sellers Fundamental Representations or a Tax Representation) the Cap
shall be an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price.

 

(b) In no event shall Sellers have any liability to Buyer in respect of any
indemnification obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)(i)_ or _Section_
__ _ 10.1(a)(ii)_ unless and until such liabilities exceed, in the aggregate,
$75,000,000.00 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and then only to the extent
such liabilities are in excess of the Basket Amount, subject to the Cap;
_provided_ , that the Basket Amount limitation shall not apply to breaches of
any of Sellers Fundamental Representation (other than with respect to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_) or any Tax Representation.

(c) No representation or warranty made in _Article III_ shall be deemed to be
breached and no claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1(a)(i)_ may be made unless the Adverse Consequences resulting from or
arising out of any individual circumstance or occurrence that results in
Adverse Consequences actually incurred or paid by a Buyer Indemnified Party
exceed $5,000,000.00 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), and if such Adverse
Consequences exceed the Per Claim Threshold, the full amount thereof (after
taking into account the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ ) shall be
taken into account in determining whether, and the extent to which, the Basket
Amount has been met and, if the Basket Amount has been met, shall be subject
to indemnification under this Article except to the extent limited by this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_; _provided_ , that the Per Claim Threshold limitation
shall not apply to breaches of any of Sellers Fundamental Representations or
any Tax Representation.

 



62

    

(d) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to any indemnity payment
for breaches of representations and warranties by the Indemnifying Party to
the extent the Indemnified Party had knowledge of any event, action or
circumstance giving rise to such breach prior to the Closing.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, (i) Sellers shall not be
liable for any Adverse Consequences actually incurred or paid by a Buyer
Indemnified Party to the extent that such Adverse Consequences arose from (A)
a change in accounting or Law, policy or practice made after the Closing Date
or (B) any Law not in force on the Closing Date, and (ii) no Party shall be
responsible for Adverse Consequences with respect to any claim which is
contingent unless and until such contingent claim becomes an actual liability
of the Indemnified Party and is due and payable, so long as such claim was
timely submitted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, no Party shall be liable
under this _Article X_ for an amount (i) to the extent, if any, that any
Adverse Consequences giving rise to such amount results from a failure on the
part of any Indemnified Party to exercise good faith in not jeopardizing or
prejudicing the interests of the Indemnifying Party or otherwise arises out of
any action taken or omitted to be taken by an Indemnified Party or (ii) unless
and until all rights and remedies of an Indemnified Party under any other
obligation of indemnification in its favor shall have first been exhausted,
including using Reasonable Efforts to (A) secure payment from insurance
policies that provide coverage with respect to such Adverse Consequences,
and (B) secure reimbursement, indemnity or other payment from any third
Person obligated by Contract or otherwise to reimburse, indemnify or pay the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Adverse Consequences.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any applicable Law to the
contrary, it is understood and agreed by each of the Parties that no
stockholder, member, partner, manager, officer, director, employee,
consultant, agent, representative or Affiliate of any Party hereto shall have
(i) any personal liability to any Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party as a result of the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise
arising out of or in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, or (ii)
any personal obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party or any
Seller Indemnified Party for any claims pursuant to this _Article X_ , and
Buyer, for itself and all other Buyer Indemnified Parties and each Seller, for
itself and all other Seller Indemnified Parties, hereby waive and release and
shall have no recourse against any of such Persons described in this _Section_
__ _ 10.5(g)_ as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein or otherwise arising out of or in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions. An Indemnified Party shall use
Reasonable Efforts to mitigate all Adverse Consequences relating to an
indemnifiable claim, including availing itself of any 

 



63

    

 defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, and other rights at law or
equity, and shall provide such evidence and documentation of the nature and
extent of such claim as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying
Party. An Indemnified Partys Reasonable Efforts shall include the reasonable
expenditure of money, including the payment of any legal fees, to mitigate or
otherwise reduce or eliminate any Adverse Consequences for which
indemnification would otherwise be due under this _Article X_.

(h) An Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations under this _Article
X_ shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the extent that the Adverse
Consequences related to a claim is covered by and paid to the Indemnified
Party pursuant to (A) a reimbursement, indemnification or payment from a
third Person with respect to such Adverse Consequences, or (B) insurance
policies that provide coverage with respect to such Adverse Consequences.

CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL ANY PARTY, OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR
STOCKHOLDERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, MANAGERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
CONSULTANTS, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR AND NO

PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST INCOME, LOSS OF USE OR BUSINESS REPUTATION OR
OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO REALIZE SAVINGS OR BENEFITS, OR ANY
DAMAGES BASED ON OR MEASURED BY ANY TYPE OF MULTIPLE, AND THE DEFINITION OF
"ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES" IN _SECTION 1.1_ SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO EXCLUDE SUCH
DAMAGES) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, EVEN IF

treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article X_ as an adjustment

will be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without
giving effect to the choice of law principles thereof. Each Party consents to
personal jurisdiction in any action brought in any court, federal or state,
within the Borough of Manhattan having subject matter jurisdiction arising
under this Agreement, and each of the Parties hereto agrees that any action
instituted by either of them against the other with respect to this Agreement
will be instituted exclusively in a court, federal or state, within the
Borough of Manhattan. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably waives the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action.

Section 11.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT A PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION RESULTING FROM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.11_.

 

Section 11.12 No Joint Venture. Nothing in this Agreement creates or is
intended to create an association, trust, partnership, joint venture or other
entity or similar legal relationship among the Parties, or impose a trust,
partnership or fiduciary duty, obligation, or liability on or with respect to
the Parties. Except as expressly provided herein, neither Party is or shall
act as or be the agent or representative of the other Party.

Section 11.13 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Contemplated Transactions is not affected in any manner
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in order that the Contemplated
Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 

Section 11.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

Section 11.15 Specific Enforcement. The Parties agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, if for any reason
any Party shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
otherwise breached this Agreement, then the Party seeking to enforce this
Agreement against such nonperforming Party under this Agreement shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and
other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy, and the Parties further agree to waive
any requirement for the securing or

 



69

    

 posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive
or other equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of
any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. If any Party
brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such Party pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by the
period of time between the commencement of such Claim and ten (10) Business
Days following the date on which such Claim is fully and finally resolved. 

Section 11.16 Legal Representation. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that Sellers Counsel has acted as
counsel for Sellers and their Affiliates, and that Sellers reasonably
anticipate that Sellers Counsel will continue to represent Sellers and their
Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, expressly consents to: (a) Sellers Counsel representation of
Sellers and their Affiliates, in any post-Closing matter in which the
interests of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers or their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse, including any matter relating to
the Contemplated Transactions or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto,
and whether or not such matter is one in which Sellers Counsel may have
previously advised Sellers or their Affiliates, and (b) the disclosure by
Sellers Counsel to Sellers or their Affiliates, as applicable, of any
information learned by Sellers Counsel in the course of its representation
of Sellers or their Affiliates, as applicable, whether or not such information
is subject to attorney-client privilege or Sellers Counsels duty of
confidentiality. Furthermore, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
(1) irrevocably waives any right it may have to discover or obtain information
or documentation relating to the representation of Sellers and its Affiliates
by Sellers Counsel in the Contemplated Transactions, to the extent that such
information or documentation was privileged as to Sellers or its Affiliates ("
_Confidential Communications_ "), and (2) agrees that (i) the privilege with
respect to such Confidential Communications shall remain with Sellers
following the Closing such that, without limiting Sellers rights to such
privilege, Sellers alone shall have and maintain the right to waive the
privilege, (ii) if Sellers former officers or managers leave any emails or
other documents (both electronic or otherwise) that contain Confidential
Communications on the servers of any Sale Entity or JV Company, such
occurrence shall not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or
any other privilege applicable to such documents, and (iii) to the extent any
emails or other documents (either electronic or otherwise) containing any
Confidential Communications are included in the computer server(s) of any Sale
Entity or JV Company or are otherwise within the records of the Sale Entities
and the JV Companies following the Closing, it will, upon discovery of any
such documents, permanently delete or destroy all such emails or other
documents containing such Confidential Communication and not review,
disclose, or otherwise use such documents or the Confidential Communications
for any purpose. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, further
covenants and agrees that each shall not assert any claim against
Sellers Counsel in respect of legal services provided to the Sale Entities
or the JV Companies by Sellers Counsel in connection with this Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions. If and to the extent that, at any time
subsequent to Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have the right to
assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between Sellers or its Affiliates and any Person representing
them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, shall be entitled to waive such privilege only with
the prior written consent of Sellers Counsel and Sellers.
