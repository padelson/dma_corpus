foregoing liquidated damages are reasonable considering all of the
circumstances existing as of the Execution Date and constitute the Parties'
good faith estimate of the damages reasonably expected to result from such
termination of this Agreement. The remedy set forth in Section 2.3(c) above or
in this Section 2.3(d) shall be Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy as a result

Time (including pipeline inventories and linefill), with the value to be based
on the actual price per MCF at the Effective Time, less amounts payable as
royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens upon, measured by or payable

or on behalf of Seller for periods from and after the Effective Time, (B)
royalties or other burdens upon, measured by or payable out of proceeds of
production, and (C) rentals and other lease maintenance payments;

(iii) if Seller is the operator under an operating agreement covering any of
Oil and Gas Property, an amount equal to the costs and expenses paid by Seller

attributable to the periods from and after the Effective Time, whether paid
before or after the Effective Time, to the extent Buyer receives the right to
obtain such amounts from joint interest owners; (iv) the amount of all Asset Taxes, whether assessed before or after Closing
Date, if any, prorated to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement but paid by
Seller;

(v) an amount equal to the value of Imbalances owing to Seller as of the

overriding royalties and other burdens measured by or payable out of such
production, and less severance taxes applicable to such production;

Defect Properties being retained by Seller or being re-assigned to Seller
pursuant to Sections 3.9 or 3.21 and the Allocated Values of those Assets
retained by Seller pursuant to Section 3.14(c).

(vii) if Seller is the operator under an operating agreement covering any of
the Assets, an amount equal to the costs and expenses paid by Buyer after the
Closing Date on behalf of the other joint interest owners that are

provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the
Parties.

(c) To the extent applicable, the Adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.4
shall be determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

2.5 Preliminary Settlement Statement. No later than four (4) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall submit a preliminary settlement
statement ("Preliminary Settlement Statement") setting forth Seller's good
faith estimate of the Adjustments and the Adjusted Purchase Price through and
including the Closing Date, consistent with past accounting practices,
together with associated backup documentation. To the extent available, actual
numbers shall be used in preparing the Preliminary Settlement Statement.
However, if actual numbers are not available, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable and good faith estimates, which estimates shall be then adjusted to
take into account actual numbers in connection with the Final Settlement
Statement. Buyer shall have two (2) Business Days to review the Preliminary
Settlement Statement and submit a written report containing any changes Buyer
proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement; provided that
Buyer's failure to propose any changes shall not prejudice Buyer's right to
assert any changes with regard to the Final Settlement Statement. The Parties
shall attempt to agree on a final Preliminary Settlement Statement no later
than one (1) Business Day prior to Closing. If the Parties are unable to agree
by that date, Seller's estimate shall be used to determine the Adjustments to
the Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4 to be used at Closing.

2.6 Final Settlement Statement; Revenue and Operating Expenses Allocation.

(a) No later than one hundred twenty (120) Days after the Closing Date, Seller
will deliver to Buyer a final settlement statement ("Final Settlement
Statement") setting forth the actual amounts of Adjustments and the resulting
Adjusted Purchase Price, together with associated back-up documentation. As
soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) Days
after Buyer receives the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer may deliver to
Seller a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes to be made
to such statement. If Buyer fails to timely deliver such written report to
Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final Settlement
Statement, the statement as delivered by Seller will be deemed to be correct
and will be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further audit
or arbitration. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
fifteen (15) Days after Seller receives Buyer's written report, the Parties
shall meet and undertake to agree on the final Adjustments to the Final
Settlement Statement. If the Parties fail to agree on the final Adjustments
within such fifteen (15) Day period, either Party may submit the disputed
items to the Accounting Referee for resolution. The Parties shall direct the
Accounting Referee to resolve the disputes within twenty (20) Days after
having the relevant materials submitted for review. The decision of the
Accounting Referee will be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. In
determining the proper amount of any Adjustment, the Accounting Referee shall
not increase the Base Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller
nor decrease the Base Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Buyer,
as applicable. The fees and expenses associated with the Accounting Referee
will be borne equally by the Parties. Any amounts owed by one Party to the
other as a result of the Final Settlement Statement, together with interest on such amount from (and
including) the Closing Date to (and excluding) the date of payment at the
Prime Rate, will be paid within five (5) Business Days after the date when the
amounts are agreed upon by the Parties or the Parties receive a decision of
the Accounting Referee, and the Adjustments included in the Final Settlement
Statement will be final and binding between the Parties and not subject to
further audit or arbitration.

(b) Except to the extent otherwise taken into account in connection with the
Adjustments to the Closing Amount or pursuant to the Final Settlement
Statement, Seller shall remain entitled to all of the rights of ownership
(including, without limitation, the right to all production, proceeds of
production and other proceeds) and shall remain responsible for all Operating
Expenses (and entitled to any refunds with respect thereto), in each case
attributable to the Assets for the period of time prior to the Effective Time.
Except to the extent otherwise taken into account in connection with the
Adjustments to the Closing Amount or in the Final Settlement Statement, and
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to all of
the rights of ownership (including, without limitation, the right to all
production, proceeds of production, and other proceeds), and shall be
responsible for all Operating Expenses (and entitled to any refunds with
respect thereto), in each case, attributable to the Assets for the period of
time from and after the Effective Time. All Operating Expenses attributable to
the Assets, in each case that are: (i) incurred with respect to operations
conducted or production prior to the Effective Time shall be paid by or
allocated to Seller and (ii) incurred with respect to operations conducted or
production from and after the Effective Time shall be paid by or allocated to
Buyer.

(c) Buyer will pay to Seller any and all revenues and other proceeds
attributable to the rights of ownership of the Assets received after Closing
by Buyer (to the extent not accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement or the Final Settlement Statement) that are attributable to the
Assets prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the occurrence of Closing,
Seller will pay to Buyer any and all revenues and other proceeds attributable
to the rights of ownership of the Assets received after Closing by Seller (to
the extent not accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement Statement or the
Final Settlement Statement) that are attributable to the Assets from and after
the Effective Time. The Party responsible for the payment of amounts received
shall reimburse the other Party within five (5) Business Days after the end of
the month in which such amounts were received by the Party responsible for
payment and, to the extent paid, such amounts shall not be taken into account
for purposes of the Final Settlement Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Section 2.6(c) shall not apply to amounts received prior to Closing if
such amounts are included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement and such
amounts (to the extent the same differ from estimates in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement) will be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement.

(d) Seller will reimburse Buyer for any and all Operating Expenses that are
paid after Closing by Buyer (to the extent not accounted for in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement Statement) and that
are attributable to the Assets prior to the Effective Time. Buyer will
reimburse Seller for any and all Operating Expenses that are paid after
Closing by Seller (to the extent not accounted for in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement Statement) and that are
attributable to the Assets from and after the Effective Time. The Party
responsible for the payment of such costs and expenses shall reimburse the
other Party within five (5) Business Days after the end of the month in which the applicable invoice
and proof of payment of such invoice were received by the Party responsible
for payment and, to the extent paid, such amounts shall not be taken into
account for purposes of the Final Settlement Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 2.6(d) shall not apply to amounts paid prior to
Closing if such amounts are included in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
and such amounts (to the extent the same differ from the estimates in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement) will be accounted for in the Final
Settlement Statement.

2.7 Allocated Values.

(a) Without limiting or modifying Section 2.7(b), Schedule 2.7 sets forth the
agreed allocation of the Base Purchase Price among the Oil and Gas Properties
("Allocated Values").

(b) Seller and Buyer agree that the Base Purchase Price, as adjusted to
include any Adjustments pursuant to Section 2.4, and any liabilities assumed
by Buyer under this Agreement, to the extent properly taken into account under
the Code, shall be allocated among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"). The Purchase Price Allocation shall be prepared in a manner that
is consistent with the Allocated Values and shall be delivered by Buyer to
Seller within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date for
Seller's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Seller and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve
any disputes relating to the Purchase Price Allocation within fifteen (15)
days. If the Parties are unable to resolve such disputes within fifteen (15)
days, such dispute shall be resolved promptly by the Accounting Referee in a
manner consistent with the procedures set forth in Section 2.6. If the Base
Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to Article 11, the Purchase Price
Allocation shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. Seller
and Buyer each agree to report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to
report, the federal, state and local income and other Tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated herein, and in particular to report the information
required by Section 1060(b) of the Code, and to jointly prepare Form 8594
(Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) consistent with the Purchase
Price Allocation as revised to take into account subsequent adjustments to the
Base Purchase Price, including any Adjustments pursuant to Section 2.4.
Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such
Purchase Price Allocation and neither Buyer nor Seller shall agree to any
proposed adjustment to the Purchase Price Allocation by any Taxing Authority
without first giving the other party prior written notice; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority based upon or
arising out of the Purchase Price Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller
shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Taxing Authority challenging such Purchase Price Allocation.

2.8 Suspended Funds. If Seller is holding any Suspended Funds as of the
Closing Date, then (a) in lieu of Seller transferring these funds to Buyer at
Closing, Seller shall retain the Suspended Funds held in its accounts, the
Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward in accordance with Section
2.4(b)(v) and (b) Seller shall provide Buyer the owner name, owner number,
social security or federal ID number, reason for suspense, and the amount of
Suspended Funds payable for each entry, together with monthly line item
production detail including gross and net volumes, associated Well(s) and deductions for all suspense entries. From and after Closing, Buyer
shall be responsible for the proper payment and distribution of the Suspended
Funds to the Non-Parties entitled to receive such Suspended Funds (including
with respect to escheat obligations) for which Buyer received a Purchase Price
adjustment under Section 2.4(b)(v) and shall RELEASE, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY and
HOLD HARMLESS Seller from and against any and all Claims asserted by Non-
Parties arising from or related to administering the distribution of such
Suspended Funds.

2.9 Assumed Liabilities. Upon Closing, Buyer assumes and hereby agrees to
assume, bear, fulfill, perform, be bound by, pay and discharge (or cause to be
assumed, borne, fulfilled, performed, paid or discharged) all Claims and other
obligations and liabilities of any kind whatsoever of Seller arising from or
relating to the Assets, whether known or unknown, liquidated or contingent,
and regardless of whether the same are deemed to have arisen, accrued or are
attributable to periods prior to, on or after the Effective Time, including
obligations and liabilities of Seller concerning: (a) the use, ownership or
operation of the Assets, (b) any obligations under or relating to any
Contracts, specifically including all obligations of each member of the Seller
Group under the Holly Agreements, (c) furnishing makeup Hydrocarbons and/or
settling and paying for Imbalances according to the terms of applicable
operating agreements, gas balancing agreements, Hydrocarbons sales,
processing, gathering or transportation Contracts, and other Contracts, (d)
paying all obligations owed to working interest, royalty, overriding royalty,
net profits and other interest owners and operators relating to the Assets,
including their share of any revenues or proceeds attributable to production

plugging and abandoning the Wells, (g) any obligation or liability for the

obligations and liabilities described in this Section 2.9 are collectively
referred to as "Assumed Liabilities"); provided, Buyer does not assume (and
Assumed Liabilities shall not include): (i) the Retained Liabilities, (ii) any
obligations or liabilities of Seller to the extent that they are attributable
to or arise out of the ownership, use or operation of the Excluded Assets, or
(iii) any other Claims for which Seller is required to indemnify Buyer
pursuant to Article 11.

2.10 Parent Guaranty. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement,
Buyer has caused Buyer Parent Company to deliver to Seller a parent guaranty
in a form mutually agreeable to the Parties, guarantying all of the
obligations, responsibilities and liabilities of Buyer hereunder, including
the Assumed Liabilities.

ARTICLE 3 
LOSS AND CASUALTY / INSPECTION OF ASSETS / 
TITLE DEFECTS / ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS

3.1 Notice of Casualty Loss. Until Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
of each instance of Casualty Loss to the Assets or any part thereof occurring
from and after the Execution Date up until the Closing, to the extent actually
known to Seller and estimated to exceed $150,000. 3.2 Casualty Loss. If, on or after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing
Date, any portion of the Assets suffers a Casualty Loss, then, subject to
Buyer's conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.2, Buyer shall
nevertheless be required to Close. If any portion of the Assets suffers a
Casualty Loss on or after the Execution Date, then, prior to Closing, Buyer
and Seller shall mutually agree to (a) have Seller restore, at its sole cost
and expense, the Asset(s) affected by such Casualty Loss to substantially
their same condition as of the Execution Date; (b) adjust the Base Purchase
Price downward by the amount by which the reduction in value to the affected
Asset(s) caused by such Casualty Loss exceeds $150,000; or (c) exclude the
affected Asset(s) from the transaction contemplated hereby and adjust the Base
Purchase Price downward by the Allocated Value of such excluded Assets;
provided that if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree, Buyer shall be entitled
to the remedy under Section 3.2(b).

3.3 Insurance. Without limiting Seller's obligations under Section 3.2, Buyer
understands and agrees that from and after the Closing, (a) no insurance
coverage under (i) any insurance policy issued to Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller, or (ii) any insurance policy (including reinsurance) issued by any
insurance company Affiliate of Seller (collectively, "Seller's Insurance
Policies") shall be made available to or cover Buyer, and (b) without
impairing or diminishing Seller's Indemnity Obligations under this Agreement,
no Claims regarding any matter whatsoever, whether or not arising from events
occurring prior to Closing, shall be made by Buyer for the direct or indirect
benefit of Buyer Group directly against or under Seller's Insurance Policies,
regardless of their date of issuance, all such Claims being deemed
automatically waived and released by Buyer upon the occurrence of the Closing.

3.4 Access.

(a) From and after the Execution Date until Closing (or earlier termination of
this Agreement but subject to the provisions of Section 3.4(b)) and upon
obtaining any required consents of Non-Parties, including Non-Party operators
of the Assets (with respect to which consents Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain), Seller shall afford to
Buyer and its representatives ("Buyer's Representatives") reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to the Assets, including the Records, following
reasonable written request from Buyer. All investigations and due diligence
conducted by Buyer or any Buyer Representative shall be conducted at Buyer's
sole risk, cost and expense and shall be conducted in compliance with the
terms of any applicable Leases, Surface Contracts and Contracts.

(b) Buyer shall abide by Seller's and any Non-Party operator's safety rules,
regulations and operating policies provided to Buyer while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Assets including any environmental or other
inspection or assessment of the Assets. Buyer does hereby RELEASE, DEFEND,
INDEMNIFY and HOLD HARMLESS each of the operators of the Assets and the Seller
Group from and against any and all Claims arising out of, resulting from or
relating to any field visit, environmental assessment or other due diligence
activity conducted by Buyer or any Buyer Representative with respect to the
Assets; provided, however, the fact that Buyer merely discovers an
Environmental Condition shall not create any liability for Buyer in connection
with this Section 3.4(b). Such Indemnity Obligations of Buyer shall apply even
if such Claims arise out of or result from the sole, joint or concurrent
negligence, strict liability or other fault of such operator or a member of the Seller Group; provided, (i)
as to any such operator, the aforesaid Indemnity Obligations shall not apply
to any Claim to the extent actually resulting on account of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such operator and (ii) as to any member of
the Seller Group, the aforesaid Indemnity Obligations shall not apply to any
Claim to the extent actually resulting on account of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of any member of the Seller Group.

(c) During all periods that Buyer and/or any of the Buyer's Representatives
are on the premises of the Assets prior to Closing, Buyer shall maintain, at
its sole expense and with J. H. Blades and Co., Inc. or other insurers
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, policies of insurance of types and in
amounts sufficient to satisfy the obligations and liabilities of Buyer under
this Section 3.4. Coverage under all insurance required to be carried by Buyer
under this Section 3.4(c) will (i) be primary insurance, (ii) list the Seller
Group, (iii) waive subrogation against the Seller Group and (iv) provide for
notice to Seller fifteen (15) Days prior cancellation or modification of the
policy or reduction in coverage. Upon request by Seller, Buyer shall provide
evidence of such insurance to Seller prior to entering the lands underlying
the Assets.

3.5 General Disclaimer of Title and Environmental Warranties and
Representations. Without limiting Buyer's remedies for either Title Defects as
set forth in Section 3.9 or Environmental Defects as set forth in Section
3.17, any remedies of Buyer with respect to Seller's Indemnity Obligations
under Section 11.2 or Buyer's remedies under the special warranty set forth in
the Assignment (a) Seller makes no warranty or representation, express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Seller's title to any of the
Assets or the environmental condition or compliance with Environmental Laws of
the Assets, (b) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's sole remedy
for any Title Defect or Environmental Defect with respect to any of the Assets
shall be the remedies set forth in Sections 3.9 and Section 3.17, and (c)
Buyer hereby expressly waives and disclaims all other rights and remedies that
Buyer may have with respect to any such Title Defect or Environmental Defect,
provided that Buyer will not be entitled to make a Claim under the special
warranty in the Assignment for any amount which, (i) together with the
aggregate amount recovered by Buyer on all Claims of Buyer under this
Agreement (other than under or pursuant to Section 11.2(c)) exceeds the Base
Purchase Price or (ii) together with the aggregate value of all Claims made
under the special warranty in the Assignment with respect to any Asset,
exceeds the Allocated Value of such Asset.

3.6 Title Benefit and Defect Notices (Buyer). On or before 5:00 p.m. Houston,
Texas time on such date that falls thirty-five (35) Days after the Execution
Date ("Defect Claim Date"), Buyer must deliver claim notices to Seller meeting
the requirements of this Section 3.6 (collectively, "Title Defect Notices" and
individually, "Title Defect Notice") setting forth any matters that, in
Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends
to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this Section 3.6. For all purposes of
this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any
Title Defect that Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a Title Defect
Notice received by Seller on or before the Defect Claim Date (provided that
Buyer does not waive its rights and remedies, and Seller shall not be released
from liability, for any matter to the extent such matter is also covered (i) by the special warranty of the Assignment or (ii) by Seller's Indemnity
Obligations under Section 11.2). To be effective, each Title Defect Notice
shall be in writing, and shall include (a) a reasonably clear description of
the alleged Title Defect(s), (b) the Wells and/or Well Locations, Leases and
Mineral Fee Interests affected by the Title Defect (each a "Title Defect
Property"), (c) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (d)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (e) the amount by which Buyer reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the
alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations upon which Buyer's belief is
based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title
Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before
the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written notice
of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week,
which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect
Claim Date; provided that Buyer's failure to provide preliminary weekly notice
of any Title Defect shall not prejudice Buyer's right to assert such Title
Defect in any Title Defect Notice. Buyer shall also promptly furnish Seller
with written notice of any Title Benefit that is discovered by any of Buyer's
or any of its Affiliate's employees, Buyer's Representatives, title attorneys,
landmen or other title examiners while conducting Buyer's due diligence with
respect to the Assets prior to the Defect Claim Date.

3.7 Title Benefit Notices (Seller). Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit (including any Title Benefit identified by
Buyer) a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including (a) a description of the
Title Benefit, (b) the Wells and/or Well Locations, Leases and Mineral Fee
Interests affected by the Title Benefit, (c) to the extent in Seller's
possession, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Buyer or Buyer's
counsel to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit(s), and (d) the
amount by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of those Wells
and/or Well Locations is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations
upon which Seller's belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all
Title Benefits of which it has not given notice on or before the Defect Claim
Date.

3.8 Seller's Right to Cure; Escrow for Title Disputes.

(a) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure at any time prior to Closing ("Cure Period"), any Title
Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer. If Seller believes that it has
cured any applicable Title Defect, Seller shall deliver written notice thereof
to Buyer, together with supporting documents available to Seller and
reasonably necessary for Buyer (as well as any title attorney or examiner
hired by Buyer) to verify the cure of such Title Defect. Buyer shall attempt,
at or prior to the end of the Cure Period, to advise Seller in writing whether
it agrees or disputes that any such Title Defect has been so cured; provided
that Buyer's failure to timely respond to Seller's notice of cure shall be
deemed Buyer's agreement that such Title Defect has been cured and Buyer's
waiver of its Claim with respect to such Title Defect. If Buyer timely
notifies Seller of a dispute as to Seller's attempted cure of any Title
Defect, then (subject to Section 3.9), the provisions of Section 3.21 shall
apply to such Title Defect.

(b) (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Seller is not able
to cure a Title Defect on or prior to Closing, Seller shall have the option,
by notice in writing to Buyer on or before one (1) Business Day prior to Closing, to attempt to cure
such Title Defect for a period of thirty (30) days after the Closing (with any
such Title Defect being called a "Post-Closing Defect"). In such event, the
Title Defect Property to which such Post-Closing Defect pertains shall remain
a part of the Assets to be assigned, subleased and transferred to Buyer at
Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, and such amount shall be paid
into an escrow account (the "Defects Escrow") established with the Escrow
Agent (the "Defects Escrow Agent") pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement in a form substantially similar to the Escrow Agreement (the
"Defects Escrow Agreement"). The amount deposited into the Defects Escrow with
respect to a Post-Closing Defect will remain therein until released as
provided in Section 3.8(b)(ii).

(ii) Buyer will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate (without being
required to expend any costs or expenses payable to a Non-Party, other than
Buyer's or its Affiliates' employees) with Seller after the Closing to cure a
Post-Closing Defect. If Seller and Buyer mutually agree that a Post-Closing
Defect has been cured, then within two (2) Business Days after such
determination, the Parties shall deliver written instructions to the Defects
Escrow Agent to release to Seller the amount withheld in the Defects Escrow
with respect thereto (together with any interest earned thereon) in accordance
with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If Seller and Buyer mutually
agree that a Post-Closing Defect has been partially cured, then Seller and
Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon the
portion of the amount retained in the Defects Escrow with respect thereto
(together with any interest earned thereon) that should be paid to Buyer to
compensate it for the uncured portion thereof (together with interest earned
thereon), and the Parties shall deliver written instructions to the Defects
Escrow Agent to release to Seller the remaining portion of such amount
(together with any interest earned thereon) in accordance with the terms of
the Defects Escrow Agreement. If Seller and Buyer mutually agree that a Post-
Closing Defect has not been cured, then within two (2) Business Days after
such determination, the Parties shall deliver written instructions to the
Defects Escrow Agent to release to Buyer the amount withheld in the Defect
Escrow with respect thereto (together with any interest earned thereon in
accordance with the terms of the Defects Escrow Agreement. If within thirty
(30) Days after the Closing Date Seller has not been able to cure, or has only
partially cured, a Post-Closing Defect (and there is no dispute as to whether
or not it has been cured or partially cured), the Parties shall deliver
written instructions to the Defects Escrow Agent to release to Buyer the
amount withheld in the Defects Escrow with respect to the uncured portion
thereof, and the Parties shall deliver written instructions to the Defects
Escrow Agent to release to Seller the amount withheld in the Defects Escrow
with respect to the cured portion (if any) (in both cases, together with any
interest earned thereon) and, in both cases, in accordance with the terms of
the Defects Escrow Agreement. If Seller and Buyer have not agreed whether
there has been a satisfactory resolution of a Post-Closing Defect after such
thirty (30) Day period elapses, then such disagreement shall be resolved in
accordance with Section 3.21. If a Post-Closing Defect has not been cured,
then unless Buyer waives such Post-Closing Defect in writing, the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property and the Parties shall deliver written instructions
to the Defects Escrow Agent to release to Buyer the amount withheld in the
Defects Escrow with respect to the Title Defect Property. (c) With respect to any Title Defects, Title Defect Amounts or Seller's
curative efforts that are in dispute as of Closing, an amount equal to the
Title Defect Amount of all Title Defects (or the Title Defect Amount and/or
cure thereof) (as asserted in good faith by Buyer, unless the Parties have
otherwise agreed upon an amount) shall be deducted from the Base Purchase
Price; and at the Closing, Buyer shall deposit such amount into the Defects
Escrow pending resolution under Section 3.21.

3.9 Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to the Parties' continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect, any Title Defect Amount, and/or the
effect of Seller's curative efforts with respect to any Title Defect pursuant
to Section 3.21 and subject to the rights of each Party pursuant to Section
10.1(d), in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in
accordance with Section 3.6 is not waived by Buyer or is not cured on or
before Closing, Seller shall, at its sole discretion, without duplication,
elect to:

(a) proceed to Closing on the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is
subject to such Title Defect, and seek to cure such Title Defect in accordance
with the Post-Closing Defect process set forth under Section 3.8;

(b) proceed to Closing on the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is
subject to such Title Defect and, subject to the Individual Title Defect
Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, reduce the Base Purchase Price
by an amount ("Title Defect Amount") determined pursuant to Section 3.12 as
being the value of such Title Defect;

(c) if Buyer agrees in writing, indemnify Buyer against all Claims resulting
from such Title Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a form reasonably
agreeable to Seller and Buyer provided, under no circumstances shall Seller's
aggregate liability thereunder exceed the Allocated Value for the Title Defect
Property made the subject thereof; or

(d) if Buyer agrees in writing, retain the entirety of the Title Defect
Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated
Assets, in which event the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of all such Asset(s).

3.10 Exclusive Remedy for Title Benefits. The aggregate Title Defect Amount
for all Title Defects for which Buyer is entitled to a remedy under Section
3.9 shall be decreased by the sum of the amounts (each a "Title Benefit
Amount") determined pursuant to Section 3.13 and subject to Section 3.20(c),
with respect to any Title Benefits timely asserted by a Title Benefit Notice
under Section 3.7.

3.11 Exclusive Remedy for Title Defects. Subject to Buyer's termination rights
under Section 10.1(d), Section 3.9 sets forth the exclusive rights and
remedies of Buyer with respect to any defect, failure, irregularity or
encumbrance affecting the title to any Asset including Seller's failure to
have Defensible Title with respect to such Asset, and Buyer hereby expressly
waives any and all other rights or remedies with respect thereto, provided
that Buyer does not waive its rights and remedies for any matter (a) to the
extent such matter also constitutes a breach of the special warranty in the
Assignment or (b) that is covered by Seller's Indemnity Obligations under
Section 11.2. 3.12 Title Defect Amount. The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title
Defect shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the affected Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect
and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms
and conditions:

(a) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(b) if the Title Defect is an encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated in
amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid
to remove such Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(c) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (i) the actual Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (ii) the Net Revenue
Interest stated in Exhibit A-2 for such Title Defect Property, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of (A) the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property multiplied by (B) 1 minus a fraction, the numerator of which
is the actual Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit A-2;

(d) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described in
subsections (a) through (c) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined
by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the
portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal
effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect
over the economic life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon
the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and such other reasonable factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation; provided, if such Title Defect is
reasonably capable of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be
greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect;

(e) if the Title Defect does not affect a Well (limited to the currently
producing formation as to such Well) or Well Location (limited to the Target
Formation as to each Well Location as shown on Exhibit A-2) throughout the
productive life of such Well (limited to the currently producing formation as
to such Well) or Well Location (limited to the Target Formation as to each
Well Location as shown on Exhibit A-2), such fact shall be taken into account
in determining the Title Defect Amount;

(f) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(g) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.12, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

3.13 Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions: (a) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(b) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (i) the actual Net
Revenue Interest for any Well or Well Location and (ii) the Net Revenue
Interest for such Wells or Well Locations listed on Exhibit A-2, then the
Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of (A) the Allocated Value of the
affected Well or Well Location multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the actual Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the
Net Revenue Interest for such Wells or Well Locations listed on Exhibit A-2
minus 1;

(c) if the Title Benefit cannot be calculated pursuant to Sections 3.13(a) or
3.13(b) above, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking
into account the Allocated Value of the subject Well or Well Location, the
legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title
Benefit over the life of the subject Well or Well Location, the values placed
upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and such other reasonable factors
as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and

(d) the Title Benefit Amount with respect to an Asset affected by any Title
Benefit shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses
included in another Title Benefit hereunder.

3.14 Environmental Assessment.

(a) Upon notice to Seller, Buyer shall have the right to conduct an
environmental assessment of all or any portion of the Assets ("Environmental
Assessment") to be conducted by a reputable environmental consulting or
engineering firm approved in advance in writing by Seller; provided, to the
extent the conduct of any part of such Environmental Assessment requires the
consent of any Non-Party, then the conduct of such part shall be subject to
obtaining such consent and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly obtain such consent. Subject to Section 3.14(c), the
Environmental Assessment shall be limited to Phase I Activities. The
Environmental Assessment shall be conducted at the sole cost, risk and expense
of Buyer, and shall be subject to Section 3.4(b) and Buyer's Indemnity
Obligations thereunder. Seller shall have the right to be present during the
Environmental Assessment of any Asset, and Buyer shall provide Seller advance
written notice of the timing of same, which shall occur during Seller's
regular hours of business. Buyer shall maintain, and shall cause members of
the Buyer Group to maintain, all information obtained by Buyer pursuant to any
Environmental Assessment or other due diligence activity as strictly
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, provided such
information shall remain confidential in perpetuity if the Closing does not
occur, unless disclosure of any facts discovered through such Environmental
Assessment is required under any applicable Law. Upon request, Buyer shall
provide Seller with a copy of the final draft of all Non-Party environmental
reports prepared on behalf of Buyer with respect to any Environmental
Assessment conducted with respect to the Assets; provided, however,
notwithstanding anything in the final draft to the contrary, Buyer makes no
representations or warranties with respect to the accuracy or contents of any
such environmental report and Seller releases Buyer from any liability with
respect thereto. If any necessary disclosures under applicable Laws are
required prior to Closing with respect to matters discovered by any
Environmental Assessment conducted by, for or on behalf of Buyer, Buyer agrees that Seller shall be the responsible party for disclosing such
matters to the appropriate Governmental Authorities to the extent Buyer is not
required by Law to disclose such matters to the appropriate Governmental
Authority.

(b) Upon completion of due diligence, except with respect to any Environmental
Conditions discovered (but not caused) by Buyer or any of Buyer's
Representatives, Buyer shall at its sole cost and expense and without any cost
or expense to Seller or its Affiliates, (i) repair all damage done to the
Assets (including the real property and other assets associated therewith)
caused by Buyer's (or any member of Buyer's Group) due diligence, (ii) restore
the Assets (including the real property and other assets associated therewith)
to the approximate same condition than they were prior to commencement of
Buyer's (or any member of Buyer's Group) due diligence and (iii) remove all
equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Assets in connection with
Buyer's (or any member of the Buyer's Group) due diligence.

(c) If Buyer discovers any matter or condition with respect to the Assets in
its Phase I Activities that in Buyer's or Buyer's Representative's reasonable
opinion warrants Phase II Activities, Buyer shall be entitled to request
permission of Seller to conduct Phase II Activities with respect to such
Assets. If Seller or any Non-Party operator with respect to the Assets refuses
to allow Buyer to conduct Phase II Activities, Buyer, at its sole election,
shall have the right to exclude the affected Asset(s) (together with all
associated Assets) from the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded
Assets.

3.15 Environmental Defects. If, as a result of its investigation pursuant to
Section 3.14, Buyer determines that with respect to the Assets there exists an
Environmental Condition (other than with asbestos, asbestos containing
materials, or NORM that is not associated with an Asset used in operations,
and excluding any matter set forth on Schedule 5.9) (in each case, an
"Environmental Defect"), then on or prior to the Defect Claim Date, Buyer may
give Seller a written notice of such Environmental Defect that sets forth the
information required by this Section 3.15 (an "Environmental Defect Notice").
For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, without waiving Buyer's rights and remedies with respect to Seller's
Indemnity Obligations under Section 11.2 or Buyer's termination rights
pursuant to Section 10.1(d), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any
Environmental Defect that Buyer fails to timely and properly assert as an
Environmental Defect by an Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller on
or before the Defect Claim Date meeting all of the requirements set forth in
the this Section 3.15. To be effective, an Environmental Defect Notice must
set forth (i) a reasonably detailed description of the matter constituting the
alleged Environmental Defect, (ii) a description of each Asset (or portion
thereof) affected by the alleged Environmental Defect, (iii) the proportionate
share attributable to the Assets of the estimated Lowest Cost Response to
eliminate the alleged Environmental Defect ("Environmental Defect Amount"),
and (iv) to the extent in Buyer's possession, supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Seller to substantiate and verify the existence of the alleged
Environmental Defect and the claimed Environmental Defect Amount. Buyer shall
furnish Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Defect
Claim Date, Environmental Defect Notices with respect to any Environmental
Defects that any of Buyer's or Buyer's Group discovers or becomes aware of
during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claim Date;
provided, however, the failure of Buyer to provide such preliminary weekly
notice shall not prejudice Buyer's right to timely assert any Environmental
Defect in any Environmental Defect Notice.

3.16 Seller's Right to Cure; Escrow for Environmental Disputes.

(a) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure or remediate at any time prior to Closing any Environmental
Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer pursuant to an Environmental
Defect Notice delivered before the Defect Claim Date. If Seller believes that
it has remediated any applicable Environmental Defect to the extent of the
Lowest Cost Response, Seller shall deliver written notice thereof to Buyer,
together with supporting documents available to Seller and reasonably
necessary for Buyer to verify such remediation of the Environmental Defects.
Buyer shall attempt, at or prior to the end of the Cure Period, to advise
Seller in writing whether it agrees or disputes that the Environmental Defect
has been so remediated; provided that Buyer's failure to timely respond to
Seller's notice of remediation shall be deemed Buyer's agreement that the
Environmental Defect has been remediated and Buyer's waiver of its Claim with
respect to such Environmental Defect. If Buyer timely notifies Seller of a
dispute as to Seller's attempted remediation of any Environmental Defect, then
(subject to Section 3.17 and Section 3.18) the provisions of Section 3.19
shall apply to such Environmental Defect.

(b) With respect to any Environmental Defects, Environmental Defect Amounts or
Seller's remediation efforts that are in dispute as of Closing, an amount
equal to the Environmental Defect Amount of all Environmental Defects (or the
Environmental Defect Amount and/or cure thereof) in dispute (as asserted in
good faith by Buyer, unless the Parties have otherwise agreed upon an amount)
shall be deducted from the Base Purchase Price; and at the Closing, Buyer
shall deposit such amount into an escrow account established with Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of an Escrow Agreement pending resolution under Section
3.19.

3.17 Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to the Parties' continuing
right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect, the Environmental
Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, and/or the effect of Seller's
remediation with respect to any Environmental Defect pursuant to Section 3.19
and subject to the rights of each Party pursuant to Section 10.1(d), if any
Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to an Environmental Defect
Notice delivered before the Defect Claim Date is not waived by Buyer or cured
on or before Closing, Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to:

(a) subject to the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold and Aggregate
Defect Deductible, reduce the Base Purchase Price by the amount of the
Environmental Defect Amount relating to such Environmental Defect as agreed
upon by Seller and Buyer or determined pursuant to Section 3.19;

(b) if Buyer agrees in writing, indemnify Buyer against all Claims resulting
from such Environmental Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a form
reasonably agreeable to Seller and Buyer; (c) if Buyer agrees in writing, retain the entirety of the Asset that is
subject to such Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, in
which event the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Assets;

(d) provided that the Parties shall have agreed to the general plan of
remediation with respect to such Environmental Defect and the time period by
which such remediation shall take place, cure such Environmental Defect after
Closing; or

(e) if such Environmental Defect can be completely cured by paying a fine or
penalty, pay such fine or penalty at or before Closing (and there shall be no
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price therefor).

If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (a) above, then Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all costs and expenses attributable
to the remediation of the applicable Environmental Defect and all losses with
respect thereto, and Buyer's obligations with respect thereto shall be deemed
to constitute Assumed Liabilities. If Seller elects the option set forth in
clause (c) above, Seller shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for
the remediation of such Environmental Defect following Closing and all losses
with respect thereto, and the Assets retained by Seller under clause (c) above
shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets.

3.18 Exclusive Remedies. Buyer's rights under Section 10.1(d), Section 3.17
and Section 3.19 set forth the exclusive rights and remedies of Buyer with
respect to any potential Claims relating to Environmental Defects, except to
the extent that any matter constituting an Environmental Defect is covered by
Seller's Indemnity Obligations in Section 11.2.

3.19 Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree
on all Environmental Defects, Environmental Defect Amounts and the effect of
any remediation efforts by Seller prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are
unable to agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect
Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this
Section 3.19 and either Party shall have the right, upon the delivery of
written notice to the other Party, to dispute such matter and to invoke the
dispute resolution provisions below in this Section 3.19 in order to resolve
any such dispute. Any such notice of dispute must be delivered on or before
the tenth (10th) Business Day after Closing. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be an environmental consultant ("Environmental
Arbitrator") with at least ten (10) years relevant experience, as selected by
mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) Days after the
applicable Party's receipt of a dispute notice, and absent such agreement, by
the CPR. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas pursuant
to the rules of the CPR to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Section 3.19. The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall
be made within twenty (20) Days after submission of the matters in dispute
(the Parties agreeing to submit to the Environmental Arbitrator a brief of its
position and all supporting documents in such Party's possession within ten
(10) Business Days following selection of the Environmental Arbitrator) and
shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. In making his/her
determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in Sections 3.17 through 3.18 and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator
are necessary to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator,
however, may not award the Buyer a greater Environmental Defect Amount than the Environmental Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable
Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Environmental Defects, Environmental Defect Amounts and remediation efforts by
Seller that are set forth in the notice of dispute delivered pursuant to this
Section 3.19 and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party
with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal
fees and other costs of presenting its case to the Environmental Arbitrator.
Each Party shall cover its corresponding fees and expenses associated with the
Environmental Arbitrator. Within ten (10) Days after the Environmental
Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his or her award
with respect to any Environmental Defect Amount, and the Parties shall direct
the Escrow Agent to release the amounts so awarded by the Environmental
Arbitrator to the applicable Party. Nothing herein shall operate to cause
Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this
Section 3.19, and, to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the
Parties as of Closing, the disputed amounts shall be deducted from the amounts
otherwise paid by Buyer at Closing and at Closing, Buyer shall deposit such
amounts into the escrow account with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement pending final resolution under this Section 3.19.

3.20 Minimum Title Defect Thresholds and Aggregate Defect Deductible for Title
and Environmental Defects.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall there
be any adjustments to the Base Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Seller or available to Buyer; (i) for any individual Environmental Defect for
which the Environmental Defect Amount does not exceed $100,000 ("Individual
Environmental Defect Threshold") and (ii) for any individual Title Defect for
which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed $100,000 ("Individual Title
Defect Threshold").

(b) To the extent, and only to the extent, that the sum of the amount of each
uncured individual Title Defect and Environmental Defect exceeds the
applicable Individual Title Defect Threshold or Individual Environmental
Defect Threshold (collectively, such excess amounts, if any, being "Aggregate
Qualified Defect Amount"), exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible, Buyer
shall be entitled to an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price in an amount
equal to the Aggregate Qualified Defect Amount.

(c) The Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible
shall also apply, mutatis mutandis, to any Title Benefits.

3.21 Title Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts and
the effect of any title curative efforts prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer
are unable to agree by Closing, the Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit
Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this
Section 3.21 and either Party shall have the right, upon the delivery of
written notice to the other Party, to dispute such matter and to invoke the
dispute resolution provisions below in this Section 3.21 in order to resolve
any such dispute. Any such notice of dispute must be delivered on or before
the tenth (10th) Business Day after Closing. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney ("Title Arbitrator") with at least
ten (10) years relevant experience, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) Days after the
applicable Party's receipt of a dispute notice, and absent such agreement, by
the CPR. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas, in
accordance with the rules of the CPR to the extent such rules do not conflict
with the terms of this Section 3.21. The Title Arbitrator's determination
shall be made within twenty (20) Days after submission of the matters in
dispute (the Parties agreeing to submit to the Title Arbitrator a brief of its
position and all supporting documents in such Party's possession within ten
(10) Business Days following selection of the Title Arbitrator) and shall be
binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. In making his/her determination,
the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Sections 3.8
through 3.13, 3.20 and this 3.21, and, subject to the foregoing, may consider
such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary to
make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may not award the
Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by
Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice and may not award Seller a greater
Title Benefit Amount than the Title Benefit Amount set forth in the applicable
Title Benefit Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect, Title
Benefit, Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts and any curative efforts
by Seller that are set forth in the notice of dispute delivered pursuant to
this Section 3.21 and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator.
Each Party shall cover its corresponding fees and expenses associated with the
Title Arbitrator. Within ten (10) Days after the Title Arbitrator delivers
written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to any Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, and the Parties shall direct the Escrow
Agent to release the amounts so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to the
applicable Party. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed
on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section 3.21, and, to
the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing,
the disputed amounts up to the Allocated Value of the affected Asset shall be
deducted from the amounts otherwise paid by Buyer at Closing and at Closing,
Buyer shall deposit such amounts into the escrow account with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement pending final resolution under this Section
3.21.

ARTICLE 5 
SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Seller represents and warrants to Buyer the following as of the Execution Date
and as of the Closing (except to the extent that such representations and
warranties are made as of another specified date):

5.1 Organization and Good Standing. Each entity constituting Seller is a
limited partnership or limited liability company, as applicable, duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State

not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),

(i) Seller shall:

(A) cause the Assets to be operated in the usual, regular and ordinary manner
consistent with past practice and in accordance with the terms of all
applicable Material Contracts, Surface Contracts and Leases, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its present business operations
relating to the Assets;

manner, on a basis consistent with prior practice, and comply in all material
respects with all contractual and other obligations;

force and effect;

destruction of any material Asset and of any written notice received or given

breach of any Lease, Surface Contract or Material Contract, (2) any Legal
Proceeding or demand by a Governmental Authority or other Non-Party to
adversely alter, terminate, rescind or procure a judicial reformation of any Lease or applicable contract or (3) any new material claim
for damages or any new investigation, suit, action or litigation with respect
to the Assets; and

(E) comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws and Orders to
which the Assets are subject;

(A) convey, sell, transfer, mortgage, pledge, dispose, abandon, burden or

(B) modify or terminate any Material Contract, other than any such Material
Contract that is modified or terminates according to its terms without action
by Seller;

(C) enter into any agreement that, if in existence as of the Execution Date,
would be a Material Contract or modify or terminate any such Material
Contract;

(D) let lapse any of Seller's insurance in force with respect to the Assets as
of the Execution Date; provided, however that if any such insurance terminates
pursuant to its terms in effect as of the Execution Date, Seller will be
obligated to renew or secure a replacement for such insurance only if such
renewal or replacement is available on commercially reasonable terms;

(E) incur any capital expenditures for an individual project or matter in
excess of $100,000 (net to the interest of Seller) except in case of emergency
or as may otherwise be reasonably required to prevent injury or damage to
Persons, property or the environment or except for expenditures that are
covered by the AFE's listed on Schedule 5.11;

(F) propose or commit to participate in the drilling of any new well or other
new operations on the Assets the cost of which (net to Seller's interest) is

Seller's position as operator with respect to the Assets;

(H) make, change or revoke any Tax election; change an annual accounting

would increase the amount of Taxes allocated to Buyer pursuant to Section
12.4; or (I) authorize or agree to take any of the actions prohibited by any of the
foregoing clauses (A) through (H).

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 7.1(a), Buyer's
consent shall not be required with respect to any action taken by Seller as
required by Law or Order or in case of emergency or as may otherwise be
reasonably required to prevent injury or damage to Persons, property or the
environment; provided, however, Seller shall provide Buyer written notice of
any such action as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

(k) Buyer shall respond to any request for consent pursuant to Section 7.1(a)
within five (5) Days following receipt of such request from Seller (or, if
applicable, such shorter time period as may be required under the terms of the
relevant Contract and indicated in such notice from Seller), and a failure to
respond within such time period shall constitute Buyer's consent to the matter
addressed in the applicable notice. Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns
undivided interests in certain of the Assets, and Buyer agrees that the acts
or omissions of the other working interests owners who are not Affiliates of
Seller shall not constitute a breach of the provisions of this Section 7.1,
nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute
such a breach so long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner that
complies with the provisions of this Section 7.1. Buyer acknowledges that as
to those Oil and Gas Properties that are operated by a Person other than
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, the obligations of Seller in this Section
7.1 shall be construed to require that Seller use its commercially reasonable
efforts (without being obligated to incur any expense to any Non-Party (other
than Seller's or its Affiliate's employees) or institute any cause of action)
to cause the operator of such Assets to take such actions or render such
performance within the constraints of the applicable operating and other
applicable agreements and applicable Law.

7.2 Return of Information. Buyer acknowledges that it is bound by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement as if it were a signatory thereto. If this
Agreement terminates, Buyer shall promptly comply with its obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement regarding the return and destruction of
Confidential Information.

7.3 Replacement of Insurance, Bonds and Other Credit Support.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that the various bonds, letters of credit, guarantees
and/or cash deposits (collectively, "Security Arrangements") set forth on
Schedule 5.20 have been provided by Seller and/or its Affiliates to
Governmental Authorities or Non-Parties to secure the payment and performance
of plugging and abandonment obligations and other obligations related to the
Assets. To the extent Seller or any of its Affiliates has any obligations
pursuant to any such Security Arrangement or has any property that secures the
repayment of any amounts advanced pursuant to any such Security Arrangements
(collectively, "Seller Obligations"), Buyer shall take such actions as are
necessary to cause the Seller Obligations arising under the Security
Arrangements set forth on Schedule 5.20 (and such Security Arrangements) to be
released and terminated concurrent with the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, Buyer's responsibility with respect to the Security
Arrangements identified in items 1, 2, 5, and 6 on Schedule 5.20 (the "Joint
Security Arrangements") shall be limited to causing that portion of the
Security Arrangements to be released, replaced and/or terminated that relate
to or affect the Assets or Assumed Liabilities. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate with each other to allocate the security
and other obligations under such Joint Security Arrangements between Buyer and
Seller. Without limitation of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that it or its
designated Affiliate must satisfy all obligations under the Acadian Agreements
to be deemed Creditworthy (as defined in the Acadian Agreements) prior to the
Closing Date and that Buyer's obligation to release the Security Arrangements
expressly includes any letters of credit posted on behalf of Seller in
connection with the Acadian Agreements.

(b) As to any immaterial Security Arrangements not listed on Schedule 5.20 and
which relate to or affect the Assets, Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to cause the Seller
Obligations arising under such Security Arrangements (as well as the
underlying Security Arrangement) to be released and terminated or refunded to
Seller ninety (90) Days following Seller notifying Buyer of such Seller
Obligations or Security Arrangements. To the extent that any Security
Arrangements, whether cash or cash-equivalents, are benefiting Buyer post-
Closing (as opposed to a Security Arrangement that is merely to be released or
terminated with no economic benefit to Buyer), then Buyer shall reimburse
Seller within ninety (90) Days following demand for the aggregate amount of
such Seller Obligations and thereafter retain the benefit of the applicable
Security Arrangement. Nothing in this Section 7.3(b) shall operate to reduce
or diminish Buyer's rights and remedies for any breach by Seller of its
representations and warranties in Section 5.20.

(c) At or prior to Closing, Buyer shall (i) obtain such insurance covering the
Assets as would be obtained by a reasonably prudent operator in a similar
situation and (ii) deliver to Seller evidence of the insurance, posting of
bonds or other security with all applicable Governmental Authorities meeting
the requirements of such Governmental Authorities to own and, where
applicable, operate, the Assets.

7.4 Notifications. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing
if such Party obtains Knowledge of any breach, in any material respect, of any
covenant, representation or warranty of the other Party contained in this
Agreement on or before the Closing Date; provided that the failure of either
Party to notify the other Party of its breach of any covenant, representation
or warranty prior to the Closing Date shall not affect either Party's rights
under Article 11 following Closing.

7.5 Release of Liens. Prior to or concurrent with the Closing, all liens and
security interests (if any) encumbering any of the Assets which secure any
debt facilities maintained by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller shall be
terminated and released; provided, the preceding provision shall not modify
the terms of Section 7.3.

7.6 Consents.

(a) With respect to each consent set forth on Schedule 5.3, Seller shall send,
within five (5) Business Days following the Execution Date, to the holder of
such consent a written notice (in forms reasonably acceptable to Buyer) in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such consent
seeking such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior
to Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the
consents set forth on Schedule 5.3, and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with
Seller in seeking to obtain such consents, but, in each case, without being obligated to pay any
consideration to a Non-Party or waive or release any right or privilege to
obtain such consent. Subject to Seller's compliance with its obligations under
this Section 7.6 and without limiting Buyer's rights under this Agreement for
any breach by Seller of Section 5.3, Buyer shall have no Claim against, and
Seller shall have no liability for, the failure to obtain any consents.

(b) If the assignment of an Asset is subject to a consent requirement and (i)
the Person holding such consent right is not a Governmental Authority, (ii)
the Asset does not contain language to the effect that the lessor or
counterparty thereto (as applicable) will have the right to terminate the
Asset if an assignment is made without the consent requirement being
satisfied, (iii) such consent does not require the payment of consideration in
exchange for obtaining such consent and (iv) the failure to obtain such
consent would not cause the assignment to Buyer to be void or voidable, then
such Asset shall be assigned to Buyer at Closing and Buyer shall have no claim
against, and Seller shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain any
such consent.

(c) If the assignment of an Asset is subject to a consent requirement and (i)
the holder of the consent right is a Governmental Authority, (ii) the Asset
contains language to the effect that the lessor or counterparty thereto (as
applicable) will have the right to terminate the Asset if an assignment is
made without the consent requirement being satisfied, (iii) such consent
requires the payment of any consideration in exchange for obtaining such
consent or (iv) the failure to obtain such consent would cause the assignment
to Buyer to be void or voidable, and the required consent is not obtained by
the Closing (in such case, a "Consent Agreement"), then such Consent Agreement
and any associated Assets located thereon shall be excluded from the Assets to
be assigned and sold to Buyer hereunder and the Base Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value, if any, of such Excluded Assets. Subject to
Buyer's remedies for Seller's breach of the representations and warranties in
Article 5 or in the Seller Certificate, if prior to Closing either Party
discovers any required consents to assign any Asset (including, without
limitation, a Consent Agreement) not set forth in Schedule 5.3 or which
constitute a Customary Post-Closing Consent, then, notwithstanding that such
consent may constitute a Permitted Encumbrance, (i) such Party shall notify
the other in writing not later than two (2) Days after such discovery, (ii)
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure such required
consent, and (iii) the provisions of this Section 7.6 shall apply to such
required consent.

(d) If after one hundred eighty (180) Days following the Closing, the required
consent has not been obtained for a Consent Agreement, then the Parties shall
discuss in good faith what further mutually agreeable actions (if any) will be
taken with respect to such Consent Agreement. If during such one hundred
eighty (180) Day period the required consent for a Consent Agreement is
obtained, then Seller shall notify Buyer and Buyer shall purchase, on or
before ten (10) Business Days following receipt of such notice, the Consent
Agreement and any associated Assets under the terms of this Agreement for a
price equal to the Allocated Value of such Consent Agreement and associated
Assets by which the Base Purchase Price was previously reduced. To the extent
such Consent Agreement has not been included in determining the Adjustments to
be made pursuant to Section 2.4 (excluding Section 2.4(b)(vi)), then the
Adjustments that are specific to such Consent Agreement shall be calculated
and contemporaneous with the payment of such Allocated Value there shall be
applied as a deduction to such Allocated Value (if the sum of the downward Adjustments exceeds the sum of the upward Adjustments) the net amount
resulting from such Adjustments or there shall be applied as an addition to
such Allocated Value (if the sum of the upward Adjustments exceeds the sum of
the downward Adjustments) the net amount resulting from such Adjustments.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the failure to obtain any
required consent for the assignment of an Oil and Gas Property from Seller to
Buyer shall not constitute a Title Defect.

7.7 Preferential Purchase Rights.

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right, Seller shall send,
within five (5) Business Days following the Execution Date, to the holder of
each such right a written notice in material compliance with the contractual
provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right.

(b) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of any part of the Assets to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies (in such case, together with any
associated Assets, a "Preferential Right Property"), that Preferential Right
Property shall be excluded from the transactions hereunder, and the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the excluded
Preferential Right Property. Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds from the
holder of a Preferential Purchase Right who exercises its right to purchase a
Preferential Right Property prior to Closing. If after the later of (i) ninety
(90) Days following Closing or (ii) such time as allowed under the instrument
creating the applicable Preferential Right, the holder of such Preferential
Right Property fails to consummate the purchase of the Preferential Right
Property covered by such right, then Seller shall notify Buyer and Buyer shall
purchase, on or before ten (10) Business Days following receipt of such
notice, the Preferential Right Property under the terms of this Agreement for
a price equal to the Allocated Value of such Preferential Right Property.
Subject to Buyer's remedies for Seller's breach of its representations and
warranties in Article 5, if prior to Closing either Party discovers a valid,
binding preferential right to purchase an Oil and Gas Property held by a Non-
Party that is not set forth in Schedule 5.10, then, notwithstanding that such
obligation may constitute a Permitted Encumbrance, (i) such Party shall notify
the other in writing not later than two (2) Business Days after such
discovery, (ii) Seller shall within two (2) Business Days of the notification
send any required notice to the holder of such preferential right, and (iii)
the provisions of this Section 7.7 shall apply to such preferential right as
if it were a Preferential Purchase Right.

(c) If, by Closing, a Preferential Purchase Right burdening any Preferential
Right Property has not been exercised, the time for exercising such
Preferential Purchase Right has not expired and such Preferential Purchase
Right has not been waived, then that Preferential Right Property shall be
excluded from the transactions hereunder, and the Base Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded Preferential Right Property.
If, following the Closing, the holder of such Preferential Right Property
notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of any part of the
Preferential Right Property, then the terms of Section 7.7 (b) shall apply
mutatis mutandis. If the time for the exercise of the Preferential Purchase
Right with respect to any excluded Preferential Right Property described in
this Section 7.7(c) expires following the Closing without the exercise of such Preferential Purchase Right by the holder
thereof or such Preferential Purchase Right is waived, then Seller shall
notify Buyer and Buyer shall purchase, on or before ten (10) Business Days
following receipt of such notice, such Preferential Right Property from
Seller, under the terms of this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated
Value of such Preferential Right Property by which the Base Purchase Price was
previously reduced. All Preferential Right Properties for which applicable
Preferential Purchase Rights have been waived prior to Closing, or as to which
the period to exercise such right has expired prior to Closing without such
right being exercised, shall be sold to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

(d) To the extent any Preferential Right Property is purchased by Buyer
following the Closing pursuant to Section 7.7(b) or (c) and such Preferential
Right Property has not been included in determining the Adjustments to be made
pursuant to Section 2.4 (excluding Section 2.4(b)(vi)), then the Adjustments
that are specific to such Preferential Right Property shall be calculated and
contemporaneous with the payment of the Allocated Value for such Preferential
Right Property there shall be applied as a deduction to such Allocated Value
(if the sum of the downward Adjustments exceeds the sum of the upward
Adjustments) the net amount resulting from such Adjustments or there shall be
applied as an addition to such Allocated Value (if the sum of the upward
Adjustments exceeds the sum of the downward Adjustments) the net amount
resulting from such Adjustments.

7.8 Operatorship. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to send notices (in
forms reasonably acceptable to Buyer) to all co-working interest owners of the
Assets that Seller currently operates on or before seven (7) Days prior to
Closing (using last known names and addresses from Seller's files) indicating
that it is resigning as operator contingent upon and effective at Closing, and
nominating and recommending Buyer (or, at Buyer's request, an Affiliate of
Buyer designated by Buyer) as successor operator, subject to and in reliance
on Buyer's representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement. Seller will, upon Buyer's request, reasonably assist Buyer in its
efforts to succeed Seller as operator of the applicable Assets, but without
Seller being obligated to pay any consideration or waive or release any right
or privilege as part of such assistance. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
the co-working interest owners may not allow Buyer to succeed Seller as
operator and that Seller has made no representation, warranty or other
guarantee that Buyer will succeed Seller as operator. Buyer shall promptly,
following Closing, file all appropriate forms, and declarations or bonds with
Governmental Authorities relative to its assumption of operatorship if Buyer
elects to assume operatorship. For all Seller-operated Assets for which Buyer
wishes to assume operatorship, Seller, subject to compliance with all
applicable operating agreements, shall execute and deliver to Buyer at Closing
and Buyer shall promptly file all the appropriate forms with the applicable
Governmental Authorities transferring operatorship of such Assets to Buyer. As
to those Assets for which Buyer shall become the operator, the Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transfer of operatorship to
occur on or promptly after Closing. If Buyer elects not to assume
operatorship, Buyer shall lend reasonable assistance to Seller in obtaining
the transfer of operatorship to the non-Party assuming operatorship. 7.9 Employment Matters.

(a) Buyer agrees that, without Seller's prior written consent and except only
as expressly otherwise provided below, until one (1) year after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly solicit for employment or hire any employee or contractor of Seller
or any of its Affiliates, except as to the Available Employees, as defined in
Section 7.9(b) below; provided that, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall be
precluded from hiring any such employee or contractor who (i) responds to any
advertisement to the public or the industry generally that is not directly or
indirectly targeted at employees of the Seller or any of its Affiliates, or
(ii) has been terminated (and not rehired) by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(but excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any such Available Employee who has
received severance from Seller or its Affiliates in connection with such
termination). If Buyer or its Affiliates breach their covenant set forth in
the preceding sentence, as liquidated damages, Buyer shall, within fifteen
(15) Days of the effective date of the hiring of such former employee of
Seller or its Affiliates, reimburse Seller for any severance benefits paid by
Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be, to such employee.

(b) Buyer or its Affiliates, in its and their sole discretion, may make offers
of employment to employees of Seller's or Seller's Affiliates' whose identity
is communicated in a written notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered
by Seller to Buyer no later than three (3) Business Days after the Execution
Date ("Available Employees"). From and after the date of delivery of such
notice, and subject to all contact and communication with such individuals
being coordinated through Seller's human resources department prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer may interview such Available Employees during normal
business hours and make offers of employment to and hire any such Available
Employees as of the Closing Date. With respect to each of the Available
Employees hired by Buyer or its Affiliates (each a "Business Employee"), if
the employment of such Business Employee is terminated by Buyer or its
Affiliates within one (1) year of the Closing Date without cause (as defined
in the Severance Plan), Buyer hereby agrees to pay such Business Employee any
applicable severance amount to which such Business Employee would have been
entitled under the "EP Energy Severance Plan" in effect as of the Closing Date
(the "Severance Plan") if such Business Employee had remained in the
employment of Seller (assuming for such purpose that the termination of
his/her employment occurred on the Day after the Closing Date). On or before
ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall provide written notice
to Buyer stating the applicable severance amount to which each Available
Employee would be entitled. Buyer or its Affiliates shall not directly or
indirectly cause a contractor to hire or retain Available Employees for the
benefit of Buyer.

7.10 HSR Act. If applicable, Seller and Buyer shall each in a timely manner
make (or cause its applicable Affiliate to make) (a) all required filings,
including filings required under the HSR Act, and prepare applications to and
conduct negotiations with, each Governmental Authority as to which such
filings, applications or negotiations are necessary or appropriate in the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) prepare such
applications and conduct such negotiations. Each Party shall cooperate with
and use all reasonable efforts to assist the other with respect to such
filings, applications and negotiations. Buyer shall bear the cost of all
filing or application fees payable to any Governmental Authority with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of whether Buyer, Seller or any Affiliate of
any of them is required to make the payment.

7.11 Change of Name. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within sixty
(60) Days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (a) eliminate and remove all EP
Energy Marks from the Assets and (b) cease using all EP Energy Marks with
respect to the Assets or otherwise. Except with respect to such grace period
for eliminating existing usage, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have
no right to use any EP Energy Marks.

7.12 Efforts. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions and to do all things necessary to consummate, make effective and
comply with all of the terms of this Agreement (including satisfaction, but
not waiver, of the conditions to Closing for which it is responsible or of
which it otherwise controls). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from time to time after Closing, Seller and Buyer shall each
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such further instruments as may
be reasonably requested by the other Party and as are commercially reasonable
to be executed in order to more effectively accomplish the purposes of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including addressing scrivener's
errors and omissions and those post-Closing actions contemplated by Section
7.6 and Section 7.7. Promptly after Closing, Buyer shall: (a) record the
Assignment and all state and federal assignments executed at the Closing in
all applicable real property records and/or, if applicable, all state and
federal Governmental Authorities and Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of
such recorded documents; (b) actively pursue the approval of all Customary
Post-Closing Consents from the applicable Governmental Authorities; (c)
actively pursue all other consents and approvals that may be required in
connection with the assignment of the Assets to Buyer and the assumption of
the rights, interests, obligations and liabilities assumed by Buyer hereunder
that have not been obtained prior to Closing, provided that Seller shall
reasonably cooperate (without incurring any expense to any Non-Party, other
than Seller's or its Affiliates' employees) with Buyer in obtaining such other
consents and approvals; and (d) deliver all notices (except to the extent
Seller is required to deliver notices hereunder) that may be required in
connection with the assignment of the Assets to Buyer and the assumption of
the rights, interests, obligations and liabilities assumed by Buyer hereunder.

7.13 Records. Following Closing, Seller shall grant Buyer reasonable access
(at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice) to the Records in Seller's or
its Affiliates' possession. Within the later of (i) five (5) Business Days
after the expiration or termination of the Transition Services Agreement
(except as otherwise provided herein), or (ii) sixty (60) days from Closing
Date, Seller shall furnish to Buyer originals (or if originals are
unavailable, legible copies) (physical or digital) of the Records that are in
Seller's or its Affiliates' possession; provided that Seller shall furnish all
digital copies of the Records in Seller's possession to Buyer as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. If Buyer desires to destroy any
Records within the retention period as stated in Section 7.14, Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing prior to such destruction and provide Seller the
opportunity to take possession of the same at Seller's sole cost.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have no obligation to deliver
originals of any Records that are subject to requests or orders from any
Governmental Authority not to dispose of such Records. 7.14 Record Retention. Buyer, for the longer of seven (7) years following
Closing or the complete abandonment of the property covered by the applicable
Records, will (a) retain the Records and (b) provide Seller Group reasonable
access to the Records regarding Taxes, Retained Liabilities or any Claims made
against Seller Group, upon reasonable prior notice, during normal business
hours for review and copying at Seller's expense.

7.15 Amendment to Schedules. Buyer agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall have the continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the
Schedules to its representations and warranties with respect to any matter
hereafter arising which, if existing on the Execution Date or thereafter,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules. For
all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether
the Buyer's closing conditions have been fulfilled, the Schedules to Seller's
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include only that information contained therein on the Execution Date and
shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement or amendment thereto.

TERMINATION

10.1 Grounds for Termination. Subject to Section 10.2, this Agreement may be
terminated (except for the provisions referenced in Section 10.2) at any time
prior to Closing upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following:

(l) by the mutual written agreement of the Parties;

(m) by either Party, if any Law or Order becomes final and effective that
prohibits and makes illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, upon notification to the non-terminating Party by the
terminating Party;

(n) by either Party, if Closing has not occurred by July 1, 2016 and through
no breach of this Agreement by the terminating Party;

(o) by either Party, upon written notice to the other Party, if the sum of (i)
any reduction in value of any Assets by reason of a Casualty Loss net of
insurance proceeds for such Casualty Loss actually delivered to Buyer (and net
of any other funds delivered to Buyer as reimbursement for such Casualty

Defects and Environmental Defects, and (iii) without duplication, any downward
adjustments to the Base Purchase Price for any Assets excluded from the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to Sections 3.9(d) and 3.17(c), in

or exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price; provided, if the
Parties have not agreed upon the aforesaid downward adjustment in the Base
Purchase Price attributable to any Title Defect, Environmental Defect or
Casualty Loss, then the downward adjustment asserted by Buyer for such Title
Defect, Environmental Defect or Casualty Loss shall be used only for purposes
of determining a Party's right to terminate under this Section 10.1(d) or
whether the condition in Section 8.3(c) has been satisfied, and provided
further that Buyer has the right to waive, by written notice to Seller, any
asserted Title Defect or Environmental Defect and any such waived Title
Defects or Environmental Defects shall be disregarded in the calculation of
the Aggregate Purchase Price Reduction;

(p) by Buyer, (i) if Seller shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.2 or (ii)
if all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 have been
satisfied or waived, as applicable, and Seller nevertheless refuses or fails to Close
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement; provided, Seller shall first
be entitled to ten (10) Days' prior notice and the opportunity to cure, and
provided furthermore that Buyer shall not be in breach in any material respect
of this Agreement at such time;

(q) by Seller, (i) if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.1 or (ii)
if all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 and Section 8.3 have been
satisfied or waived, as applicable, and Buyer nevertheless refuses or fails to
Close the transactions contemplated in this Agreement; provided, Buyer shall
first be entitled to ten (10) Days' prior notice and the opportunity to cure,
and provided furthermore that Seller shall not be in breach in any material
respect of this Agreement at such time; or

(r) by Seller, if Seller has not received a Federal Reference Number
confirming that the Deposit has been wired to the Escrow Account on or before
12:00 P.M. CST on Monday, March 21, 2016.

10.2 Effect of Termination. If a Party is entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with Section 10.1 then the Party so entitled to terminate this
Agreement shall be entitled to the remedy for such Party set forth in Section
2.3, as such Party's sole and exclusive remedy hereunder. If the Agreement is
terminated by a Party pursuant to Section 10.1, then except for the provisions
of Section 2.3, Section 3.4(b), Article 4, Section 7.2, the first sentence of
Section 7.9(a), this Section 10.2, Section 10.3, Section 11.7 and Article 13
(other than Section 13.2), which provisions shall survive any such
termination, the Parties shall have no further liability or obligation
hereunder.

10.3 Confidentiality. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary but subject to the following
sentence, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, shall remain in full
force and effect. If Closing of the transactions contemplated under the terms
of this Agreement occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate (which
termination shall be effective as of Closing) only with respect to
Confidential Information covering the Assets.

ARTICLE 11 
ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND INDEMNITIES

11.1 Opportunity for Review. Each Party represents that it has had an adequate

including the opportunity to submit the same to legal counsel for review and
comment. Based upon the foregoing representation, the Parties agree to the
provisions set forth below.

11.2 Seller's Indemnity Obligation. If Closing shall occur, then effective
from and after the Closing Date, and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.4, Seller shall RELEASE, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY and HOLD HARMLESS Buyer
Group from and against any and all Claims arising out of, resulting from, or
relating to: (f) any breach by Seller of Seller's representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement;

(g) any breach by Seller of Seller's covenants set forth in this Agreement;
and/or

(h) the Retained Liabilities.

Seller shall not have any obligation to provide indemnification for any
matters to the extent (and then only to the extent) accounted for in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement Statement.

Closing Date, Buyer shall RELEASE, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY and HOLD HARMLESS Seller

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall have no
obligation or liability for any Claim arising out of or related to its
Indemnity Obligations under Section 11.2(a):

(a) if such Claim has a value of $100,000 or less ("Individual Indemnity
Threshold") (individual Claims below the Individual Indemnity Threshold shall
not count towards the Indemnity Deductible Amount); provided that such
Individual Indemnity Threshold shall not apply to Claims related to (i)
breaches of the Specified Representations and Warranties or (ii) any breach of
Section 5.14;

(b) if such Claim is asserted more than one (1) year after the Closing Date;
provided, however, Claims for Seller's breach of (i) the Specified
Representations and Warranties may be asserted within the applicable statute
of limitations and (ii) Section 5.14 may be asserted at any time on or prior
to the date that is eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date;

(c) to the extent the aggregate amount of all Claims asserted by Buyer Group
do not exceed the Indemnity Deductible Amount, after which point Seller will
only have an Indemnity Obligation to the incremental extent of the value of
any Claims in excess of the Indemnity Deductible Amount; provided that such
Indemnity Deductible Amount shall not apply to Claims related to (i) breaches
of the Specified Representations and Warranties or (ii) any breach of Section
5.14; or (d) for any Claims to the extent such Claims in the aggregate exceed 20% of
the Adjusted Purchase Price, provided, however, Seller's aggregate liability
for Claims related to Seller's breach of the Specified Representations and
Warranties and/or Section 5.14 shall not exceed 100% of the Adjusted Purchase
Price.

For the purposes of this Article 11, in determining if there has been a loss
resulting from the breach of any representation or warranty hereunder and the
amount of the Claims in respect thereof, the representations and warranties
shall be read without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or qualification with a similar meaning contained or incorporated
directly or indirectly in such representation or warranty. Further, Seller's
aggregate liability for Claims under Section 11.2(b) (excluding Seller's
Indemnity Obligations under Section 11.2(c)) shall not exceed 100% of the
Adjusted Purchase Price.

11.5 Notice of Claims. If a Claim is asserted against a Person for which a
Party may have Indemnity Obligations under this Agreement (an "Indemnity
Claim"), the indemnified Person shall give the indemnifying Party written
notice of the underlying Claim setting forth the particulars associated with
the underlying Claim (including a copy of the written underlying Claim, if
any) as then known by the indemnified Person ("Indemnity Claim Notice"). For
Indemnity Claims with respect to which the Individual Indemnity Threshold in
Section 11.4 applies, an Indemnity Claim shall be deemed to have been made
(subject to the provisions of Section 11.4) upon the indemnified Person's
providing an initial Indemnity Claim Notice to the indemnifying Party stating
that the Claim underlying the Indemnity Claim could reasonably be expected to
exceed the Individual Indemnity Threshold. The indemnified Person shall, to
the extent practicable, give an Indemnity Claim Notice within such time as
will allow the indemnifying Party a reasonable period in which to evaluate and
timely respond to the underlying Claim; provided, (a) failure to do so shall
not affect an indemnified Person's rights hereunder except for, and only to
the extent of, any increase in the cost of the Indemnity Claim resulting from
the failure to give notice; and (b) the foregoing shall not extend the time
period set forth in Section 11.4 (if applicable to the Claim), but if an
Indemnity Claim Notice is given to an indemnifying Party within the applicable
time period (if any) with respect to such Claim set forth in Section 11.4,
such Indemnity Claim Notice shall be effective, subject to the other
limitations in Section 11.4 (if applicable), as to costs and expenses incurred
or suffered after the expiration of any such time period, with respect to the
matter described in such Indemnity Claim Notice.

11.6 Defense of Non-Party Claims. Upon receipt of an Indemnity Claim Notice
involving a Non-Party for which an indemnifying Party believes it may have an
obligation of indemnity under this Agreement, the indemnifying Party shall, if
it so elects in accordance with this Section 11.6 (without prejudice to its
right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this Agreement), assume the
defense of the Non-Party Claim with counsel selected by the indemnifying
Party, and the indemnified Person shall cooperate in all reasonable respects.
If any Non-Party Claim involves a fact pattern wherein each Party may have an
obligation to indemnify the other Party, each Party may assume the defense of
and hire counsel for that portion of the Non-Party Claim for which it may have
an obligation of indemnity. In all instances, the indemnified Person may
employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Non-Party Claim;
provided, if the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Non-Party
Claim pursuant to this Section 11.6 and has agreed to indemnify the indemnified Person, the fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the indemnified Person shall be borne solely by the indemnified Person. To the
extent that the underlying Non-Party Claim meets any applicable per-Claim
threshold, if (a) the underlying Non-Party Claim plus all previously asserted
underlying Claims have exceeded the Indemnity Deductible Amount, if applicable
in the circumstances, and (b) the indemnifying Party elects by written notice
to undertake the defense of the Non-Party Claim within thirty (30) Days after
receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice, then (i) the indemnifying Party shall
defend the indemnified Person against such Non-Party Claim, (ii) the
indemnifying Party shall pay any judgment entered or settlement with respect
to such Non-Party Claim, (iii) the indemnifying Party shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Non-
Party Claim that (A) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or
claimant in the matter releases the indemnified Person from all liability with
respect to such Non-Party Claim, or (B) would restrict such indemnified
Person's ability to conduct its business in the ordinary course, and (iv) the
indemnified Person shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to such Non-Party Claim without the
indemnifying Party's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).
If the indemnifying Party has not elected to undertake the defense of a Non-
Party Claim, or if the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Non-Party
Claim pursuant to this Section 11.6 but fails to diligently defend against the
Non-Party Claim within thirty (30) Days following any written notice from such
indemnified Person asserting such failure, then the indemnified Person shall
have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the indemnifying
Party (to the extent the indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
hereunder), the Non-Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings. In such
instances, the indemnified Person shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings; provided, the indemnified Person shall not settle such Non-Party
Claim without the written consent of the indemnifying Party; provided further,
if the indemnifying Party fails to notify the indemnified Person in writing as
to whether or not it consents to such settlement within thirty (30) Days
following its receipt of notice of such settlement from the indemnified
Person, then such consent shall be deemed given. The indemnifying Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by an
indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 11.6, and the indemnifying Party
shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 11.6, if the indemnifying
Party disputes its potential liability to the indemnified Person under this
Section 11.6 and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the indemnifying
Party, the indemnifying Party shall not be required to bear the costs and
expenses of the indemnified Person's defense pursuant to this Section 11.6.

11.7 Waiver of Certain Damages. NONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BUYER GROUP OR
SELLER GROUP SHALL BE ENTITLED TO (AND EACH OF THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVES
AND RELEASES, AND SHALL CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF ITS GROUP TO WAIVE AND RELEASE)
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE AND EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS (OTHER THAN LOST PROFITS THAT
CONSTITUTE DIRECT DAMAGES AS A MATTER OF LAW) WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE OR
CLAIM ARISING UNDER, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER AGREEMENT, CONTRACT OR INSTRUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY APPLICABLE
PARTY SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES TO A NON-PARTY, WHICH DAMAGES (INCLUDING COSTS OF DEFENSE
AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH DEFENDING SUCH
DAMAGES) SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED BY THIS PROVISION AS TO RECOVERY HEREUNDER.

11.8 Survival of Claims. Notwithstanding the termination of any Claim period
set forth in Section 11.4, any Claim properly raised within the applicable
time period for such Claim shall survive until such Claim and the Indemnity
Obligations with respect thereto are resolved. The Buyer's covenants and
Indemnity Obligations under Section 11.3 shall survive forever.

11.9 Exclusive Remedy. If Closing occurs, absent fraud, the Indemnity
Obligations set forth in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies of
each Party against the other Party for the breach of any representation or
warranty or any covenant to be performed prior to Closing set forth in this
Agreement.

11.10 Extent of Indemnification. Without limiting the scope of the
indemnification, disclaimer, release and assumption obligations set forth in
this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, an indemnified Person
shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder in accordance with the terms
hereof, regardless of whether the Claim or indemnifiable loss giving rise to
any such Indemnity Obligation is the result of the sole, partial, active,
passive, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict liability, other legal
fault or responsibility, or violation of any Law of or by any such indemnified
Person, but excluding, in each case, the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such indemnified Person.

ARTICLE 12 
TAXES

12.1 Like Kind Exchange. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, each
Party shall have the right to structure the transactions contemplated under
the terms of this Agreement as a Like-Kind Exchange. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this agreement, in connection with effectuating a Like-Kind
Exchange, each Party shall have the right, at or prior to the Closing Date or
any subsequent closing, to assign all or a portion of its rights under this
Agreement (the "Assigned Rights") to a "qualified intermediary" (as that term
is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) or to a
"qualified exchange accommodation titleholder" (as that term is defined in
U.S. Revenue Procedure 2000-37). In the event a Party (in its capacity as an
exchanging party, referred to in this Section 12.1 as an "Exchanging Party")
assigns the Assigned Rights to a "qualified intermediary" pursuant to this
Section 12.1, then such Exchanging Party agrees to notify the other Party in
writing of such assignment reasonably in advance of the Closing Date. In
addition, should a Party choose to effectuate a Like-Kind Exchange, the
Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in
the completion of such an exchange, including the execution of all documents
reasonably necessary to effectuate such a Like-Kind Exchange; provided,
however, that (a) the Closing Date shall not be delayed or affected by reason
of the Like-Kind Exchange, (b) the Exchanging Party shall effect its Exchange
through an assignment of the Assigned Rights to a "qualified intermediary" or
to a "qualified exchange accommodation titleholder," but such assignment shall
not release such Exchanging Party from any of its liabilities or obligations
under this Agreement and (c) the non-Exchanging Party shall incur no
additional unreimbursed costs, expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or in connection with the
exchange requested by the Exchanging Party. Each of Seller and Buyer does
hereby and shall RELEASE, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY and HOLD HARMLESS the other Party
against any and all costs and expenses incurred with respect to furnishing
such cooperation. Each of Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge and agree
that any assignment of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1 shall not
release a Party from, or modify, any of its respective liabilities and
obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other) under this
Agreement. Neither Party, by its consent to a Like-Kind Exchange, shall be
responsible in any way for the Exchanging Party's compliance with such Like-
Kind Exchange.

12.2 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Return and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other Party's request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Each of Buyer and Seller agrees (a) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the acquired Assets relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (b) to
give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so
requests, each Party shall allow the other Party the option of taking
possession of such books and records prior to their disposal. Buyer and Seller
further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated.

12.3 Tax Returns. Seller shall be responsible for filing Tax Returns for
severance, production and similar Asset Taxes which are required to be filed
on or before the Closing Date and paying the Taxes reflected on such Tax
Returns as due and owing. Seller shall file Tax Returns for ad valorem and
property Taxes which are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date,
provided that Buyer shall be responsible for protesting the ad valorem and
property tax valuations with respect to such Tax Returns if Buyer chooses to
make such a protest. Buyer shall pay the full year ad valorem and property tax
bills and notify Seller of its share pursuant to Section 12.4. Seller will
cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed consistently with past practice
except as otherwise required by applicable law and will provide a copy to
Buyer, and Seller shall not file any material Tax election with respect to the
Assets without Buyer's consent.

Buyer shall be responsible for filing Tax Returns for all Asset Taxes that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date and paying the Taxes reflected on
such Tax Returns as due and owing.

12.4 Proration of Taxes. Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets for any period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Effective Time. Buyer shall be
responsible for all Taxes attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets for any period or portion thereof beginning on or after the
Effective Time. Asset Taxes assessed against the Assets with respect to the
Tax period in which the Effective Time occurs ("Current Tax Period"), but
excluding Asset Taxes which are based on quantity of or the value of
production of Hydrocarbons, shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as
of the Effective Time with (a) Seller being obligated to pay a proportionate
share of the actual amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined
by multiplying such actual Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Current Tax Period prior to the Effective Time and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Tax Period and
(b) Buyer being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the actual amount of
such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined by multiplying such actual
Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days (including
the Effective Time) in the Current Tax Period on and after the Effective Time
and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Tax
Period. Asset Taxes which are based on quantity of or the value of production
of Hydrocarbons shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer based on the
number of units or value of production actually produced, as applicable,
before, and at or after, the Effective Time. In the event that Buyer or Seller
makes any payment for which the other Party is responsible under this Article
12 and such payment has not been taken into account in Section 2.4, such other
Party shall reimburse the paying Party promptly but in no event later than ten
(10) Days after the presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the paying Party is entitled along with such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of the
reimbursement.

12.5 Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all
federal, state and local transfer, sales, use, stamp, documentary, gross
receipts, registration or other similar Taxes or assessments ("Transfer
Taxes") resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other transaction document. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes.

12.6 Notices. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing upon receipt by
Seller of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments
relating to the income, properties or operations of Seller that reasonably may
be expected to relate to or give rise to a Lien on the Assets that would not
be released at Closing. Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the
other in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit
or assessment challenging the Purchase Price Allocation.

12.7 Treatment of Payments. Any payments made to any party pursuant to Article
11 shall constitute an adjustment of the Base Purchase Price for Tax purposes
and shall be treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns to the
extent permitted by law.

ARTICLE 13

which such notice is received by the addressee, if by mail, or on the date sent, if

provided, if such date is not a Business Day or even if such date is a

change its address by notifying the other Party in writing of such address
change. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or
taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any
notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date which is
not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such
action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required
to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.

and filing documents associated with the transfer of the Assets to it and for
all costs and fees associated therewith, including filing the Assignment and
any other assignments with appropriate federal, state and local Governmental
Authorities as required by applicable Law. As soon as practicable after

13.3 Amendments and Severability. No amendments or other modifications to this
Agreement shall be effective or binding on either of the Parties unless the
same are in writing, designated as an amendment or modification, and signed by
both Seller and Buyer. The invalidity of any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, and in
case of any such invalidity, this Agreement shall be construed as if the
invalid provision had not been included herein.

13.4 Successors and Assigns. Except as set forth in this Section 13.4, this
Agreement may not be assigned, either in whole or in part, without the express
written consent of the non-assigning Party. The terms, covenants and
conditions contained in this Agreement are binding upon and inure to the
benefit of Seller and Buyer and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Seller or Buyer may assign
either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder
without the prior written approval of the other Party to (a) an Affiliate or
(b) a Non-Party accommodator or qualified intermediary in connection with any
like-kind exchange, as described in Section 12.1; provided, however, that no
such assignment shall relieve the other Party of any of its obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement.

13.5 Headings. The titles and headings set forth in this Agreement have been
included solely for ease of reference and may not be considered in the
interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

13.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.

(a) This Agreement is governed by the Laws of the State of Texas, excluding
any choice of law rules that may direct the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the assumption of liabilities and indemnity
obligations herein shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Texas,
notwithstanding whether any Claim made in connection with such obligations, or
agreed limitations thereon, would be enforceable under the Laws of the State
where the damages occur or the cause of action arises.

(c) The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas or any Texas
state court sitting in Houston, so long as one of such courts shall have
subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any
cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of
business in the State of Texas, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.

(d) With respect to any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the Parties agree to
waive any and all rights to a trial by jury.

13.7 No Partnership Created. It is not the purpose or intention of this
Agreement to create (and it should not be construed as creating) a joint
venture, partnership or any type of association, and the Parties are not
authorized to act as an agent or principal for each other with respect to any
matter related hereto.

13.8 Public Announcements. No member of the Seller Group or Buyer Group may
issue a public statement or press release with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the price and other terms) without the prior
written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except as required by Law or listing agreement with a national
security exchange, and then only after prior consultation with the other
Party.

13.9 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
entitle anyone other than Seller and Buyer, their successors and permitted
assigns or the express beneficiaries of indemnity provisions to any Claim,
cause of action, remedy or right of any kind whatsoever; provided that only a
Party and its respective successors and permitted assigns will have the right
to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own behalf or on behalf of
any of its related indemnified Persons (but shall not be obligated to do so).

13.10 Construction. The Parties acknowledge that they have had an adequate
opportunity to review each and every provision contained in this Agreement and
to submit the same to legal counsel for review and comment. Moreover, the
Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. Based on the foregoing, the Parties agree that the rule of
construction that a contract be construed against the drafter, if any, not be
applied in the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

13.11 Schedules. The inclusion of any matter upon any Schedule does not
constitute an admission or agreement that such matter is material with respect
to the representations and warranties contained herein.

13.12 Conspicuousness of Provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in this Agreement that are set out in "bold" satisfy
the requirement of the "express negligence rule" and any other requirement at
Law or in equity that provisions contained in a contract be conspicuously
marked or highlighted. 13.13 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, all of which
when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

13.14 Entire Agreement. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, this
Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations,
understandings, letters of intent and agreements (whether oral or written)
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and constitute
the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

13.15 Seller Parties. All duties, covenants, obligations, indemnities, and
liabilities hereunder of the entities constituting Seller shall be joint and
several.
