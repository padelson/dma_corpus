 **ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Asset Purchase Agreement (this " ** _Agreement_** "), dated June 23, 2019
(the " ** _Execution Date_** "), is by and among Archrock Services, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (the " ** _Buyer_** "), Elite Compression
Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " ** _Seller_** "),
and Archrock, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " ** _Parent_** "). The Buyer,
the Seller and the Parent, are sometimes referred to collectively herein as
the " ** _Parties_** " and individually as a " ** _Party_**."

 



 

 **RECITALS:**

 



 

WHEREAS, as of the Execution Date, the Seller owns and operates the Business
(as defined herein).

 



 

WHEREAS, the Buyer desires to purchase, and the Seller desires to sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Buyer, the Acquired Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities for the consideration set forth below, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT:**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound,
the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
CERTAIN DEFINITIONS**

 



 

1.1 _Certain Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are
not defined in the text of the body of this Agreement shall have the
respective meanings given such terms as set forth on _Schedule A_ attached to
this Agreement, and _Schedule A_ is incorporated herein by reference with the
same force and effect as is set forth herein in full.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
THE TRANSACTION**

 



 

2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Acquired Assets; Assumption of Assumed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, the Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the
Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase and acquire from the Seller, free and
clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances, all assets, properties,
rights, titles and interests of every kind and nature owned, licensed or
leased by the Seller except for the Excluded Assets, whether tangible or
intangible, real or personal and wherever located and by whomever possessed,
including those assets set forth on _Schedule 2.1(a)_ (collectively, the " **
_Acquired Assets_** ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Seller
shall retain and not sell, assign, transfer, convey or deliver to the Buyer,
and the Buyer shall not

     

 

 



 

purchase or acquire from the Seller, and the Acquired Assets shall not
include, those specific assets, properties, interests and rights of the Seller
set forth on _Schedule 2.1(b)_ (the " ** _Excluded Assets_** ").

 



 

(c) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, the Seller shall irrevocably convey, transfer and assign to the
Buyer, and, without limiting Buyers rights to indemnity under _Article X_ or
waiving Buyers rights under the Transaction Documents, Buyer shall assume
from the Seller and agrees to fulfill, perform, pay and discharge (or cause to
be fulfilled, performed, paid or discharged) all obligations and Liabilities,
known or unknown, of Seller (other than the Excluded Liabilities) to the
extent arising from, based upon, related to or associated with the Business or
the Acquired Assets, regardless of whether such obligations or Liabilities
arose prior to, on or after the Closing Date, including, but not limited to,
the Assumed Litigation and the obligations and Liabilities set forth on
_Schedule 2.1(c)_ (all of said obligations and Liabilities, the " ** _Assumed
Liabilities_** ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall not
assume, or otherwise be responsible for, any Excluded Liabilities, regardless
of whether such Liabilities arose prior to, on or after the Closing Date.

 



 

2.2 _Payments at the Closing_.

 



 

(a) The aggregate consideration to be paid by the Buyer for the Acquired
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities shall be $410,000,000,
consisting of (i) an amount of cash equal to $205,000,000 (the " ** _Cash
Consideration_** "), which shall be payable in accordance with this _Section
2.2_, subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and _Section 6.6_, and
(ii) 21,656,683 newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share
(" ** _Parent Common Stock_** "), of the Parent which will be validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable, and free and clear of all Liens and preemptive
rights, except for (i) restrictions on transfer arising under applicable
securities Laws and (ii) the applicable terms and conditions of the
Organizational Documents of the Parent (the " ** _Equity Consideration_** "
and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " ** _Total Consideration_**
").

 



 

(b) Upon the terms of and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Buyer shall (x)
pay or cause to be paid (i) to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) specified in writing by the Seller at least
two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the
Initial Closing Payment, (ii) the payoff amounts set forth in the Debt Payoff
Letters (the " ** _Payoff Amounts_** ") in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in such amounts and to such accounts as set forth
in the Debt Payoff Letters and (iii) as specified in writing by the Seller, to
each payee of the Closing Transaction Expenses, in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount sufficient to pay the Closing
Transaction Expenses attributable to such payee; and (y) deliver or cause to
be delivered to the Seller evidence of the issuance to the Equity Recipient of
the Equity Consideration per _Section 8.5(b)(v)_.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Not fewer than five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a statement setting forth the Sellers
good faith estimates of (i) Closing Date Net Working Capital (" ** _Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital_** "), (ii) Closing Date Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures (" ** _Estimated Closing Date Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures_** ") and (iii) based on the foregoing, the Initial Closing
Payment (collectively the " ** _Estimated Closing Statement_** "), which shall
be accompanied with reasonable supporting documentation for such calculations.
Set forth on _Schedule 2.2(c)_ , for illustrative purposes only, is a sample
Estimated Closing Statement, calculated as if the Balance Sheet Date were the
Closing Date. The Seller shall provide the Buyer and its Representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the personnel of, and work
papers prepared by, the Seller and its Representatives, to the extent they
relate to the Estimated Closing Statement and to such historical financial or
other information relating to the Estimated Closing Statement as the Buyer may
reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Estimated Closing
Statement and preparing a written report containing all changes that the Buyer
proposes to the Estimated Closing Statement, if any, together with an
explanation of such changes, which report shall be delivered within four
Business Days after the Buyers receipt of the draft Estimated Closing
Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall be in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the
Seller or the Business. The Buyer and the Seller shall discuss in good faith
any proposed changes to the Estimated Closing Statement. If the Buyer and the
Seller agree on changes to the Initial Closing Payment based on such
discussions, then the Initial Closing Payment shall, for purposes of _Section
2.2(b)_, be based on such changes. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to
agree on changes proposed by the Buyer to the Initial Closing Payment prior to
the Closing Date or the Buyer does not timely deliver a written report of
proposed changes pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_, the items of the Initial
Closing Payment not agreed to as proposed by the Seller in the Estimated
Closing Statement shall control for purposes of determining the amount payable
to the Seller by the Buyer at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event that
the Buyer and the Seller are unable to agree on changes proposed by the Buyer
to the Initial Closing Payment prior to the Closing Date or the Buyer does not
timely deliver a written report of proposed changes pursuant to this _Section
2.2(c)_, any such item of the Initial Closing Payment not agreed upon shall
nevertheless remain subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.3_.

 



 

2.3 _Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller a statement (the " ** _Closing Statement_** ") setting
forth the Buyers determination of (i) Closing Date Net Working Capital, (ii)
Closing Date Reimbursable Capital Expenditures and (iii) the Final Cash
Purchase Price. Following delivery of the Closing Statement, which shall be
accompanied with reasonable supporting documentation for such calculations,
the Buyer shall promptly provide the Seller with any additional information
reasonably requested by Seller supporting the calculations contained in the
Closing Statement.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Seller shall have 45 days (the
" ** _Review Period_** ") to review the Closing Statement. During the Review
Period, the Seller and its Representatives shall have access to the books and
records of the Business and otherwise related to the Acquired Assets, the
personnel of, and work papers prepared by, the Buyer and/or the Buyers
Representatives to the extent that they relate to the Closing Statement and to
such historical financial or other information relating to the Closing
Statement as the Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing
the Closing Statement and preparing an Objections Statement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of the Buyer or the Business.

 



 

(c) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Seller shall deliver
to Buyer a written statement either accepting the Closing Statement or
specifying any objections thereto in reasonable detail (an " ** _Objections
Statement_** "). If the Seller does not deliver an Objections Statement on or
prior to such date, then the Closing Statement shall become final and binding
upon all Parties. If Seller delivers an Objections Statement on or prior to
such date, then the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other,
shall negotiate in good faith for 15 days following the Buyers receipt of
such Objections Statement to resolve the Sellers objections. Any such
objection that the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other, are
unable to resolve during such 15-day period is referred to as a " **
_Dispute_**." After such 15-day period, any matter set forth in the Closing
Statement that is not in dispute shall become final and binding upon the
Parties. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve all objections
during such 15-day period, then after such period has elapsed either the Buyer
or the Seller may refer any Disputes, and only such Disputes, to Grant
Thornton LLP for resolution or, if Grant Thornton LLP is not available for
such assignment, another nationally recognized accounting firm upon which the
Buyer and the Seller shall reasonably agree (the " ** _Accounting Firm_** ").
The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert, and not an arbitrator. The Buyer
and the Seller shall each promptly execute a customary engagement letter with
respect to the engagement of the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall be
instructed to resolve any Disputes in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement within 30 days after its engagement (or such other time as the
Parties shall agree in writing). The resolution of such Disputes by the
Accounting Firm (i) shall be set forth in writing, (ii) may not assign a value
greater than the greatest value or smaller than the smallest value for each
Dispute claimed by either the Seller, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the
other, (iii) shall be based solely on written submissions and presentations by
the Buyer and the Seller and not on independent review, (iv) shall constitute
an arbitral award, and (v) shall be conclusive and binding upon all the
Parties upon which a judgment may be rendered by a court having proper
jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is sought to be
enforced. Upon delivery of such resolution, the Closing Statement, as the same
may be modified in accordance with such resolution and any other mutual
resolutions of the Parties memorialized in writing, shall become final and
binding upon all Parties. The Seller and the Buyer will each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the Accounting Firm. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and of any enforcement of the
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Seller and the
Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm. The proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts

 



     

 

 



 

in dispute and shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the
determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.
The date on which the Final Cash Purchase Price is finally determined in
accordance with _Section 2.3_ is referred to as the " ** _Determination
Date_**."

 



 

(d) The " ** _Adjustment Amount_** ," which may be positive or negative, shall
mean an amount equal to the Final Cash Purchase Price (as finally determined
in accordance with _Section 2.3(c)_) minus the Initial Closing Payment. The
Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance with this _Section 2.3(d)_.

 



 

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Buyer shall
promptly (but not later than five Business Days after the Determination Date)
deliver to the Seller (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) specified in writing by the Seller) an amount in cash equal to the
Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount being referred to as the " ** _Shortfall_** "), then the
Seller shall promptly (but no later than five Business Days after the
Determination Date) deliver to the Buyer (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) specified in writing by the Buyer) an amount
in cash equal to the Shortfall.

 



 

(iii) All payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(d)_ shall be treated as
adjustments to the purchase price paid for the Acquired Assets for all Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

2.4 _Tax Allocation_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that, for federal income Tax purposes, and any
applicable state or local income Tax purposes, the Total Consideration, as
adjusted under this Agreement, plus any liabilities or other items treated as
amounts realized for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, shall be allocated
among the Acquired Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " ** _Allocation Schedule_**
"). On or before the 90th day after the Determination Date, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller the Allocation Schedule for Sellers review, comment and
approval. Seller and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes
relating to the Allocation Schedule as promptly as practicable. At any time
after the tenth day following Buyers delivery of the Allocation Schedule to
Seller, if Seller and Buyer have not resolved any such dispute, such dispute
shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm applying, _mutatis mutandis_ , the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.3(c)_. The Seller, the Buyer and their
respective Affiliates shall report the transactions contemplated hereby on all
Tax Returns, including, but not limited to IRS Form 8594, in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Schedule. After Closing, if there is an
adjustment to the Total Consideration and if such difference requires an
adjustment to the Allocation Schedule, then the Buyer shall prepare such
adjustment to the Allocation Schedule, which adjustment shall be submitted to
the Seller, and the Buyer and the Seller shall use their good faith efforts to
agree on the final

 



     

 

 



 

adjustment within 30 days after the delivery of such revised Allocation
Schedule; _provided_ that if the Parties cannot agree on such adjustment, such
adjustment shall be determined by the Accounting Firm applying, _mutatis
mutandis_ , the procedures set forth in _Section 2.3(c)_. The Seller and the
Buyer agree to: (i) be bound by the Allocation Schedule agreed upon under this
_Section 2.4(a)_; (ii) prepare and file, and cause its respective Affiliates
to prepare and file, all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Schedule; and (iii) take no position, and cause
its respective Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the
Allocation Schedule in any Tax Return, any audit or examination by, or any
Proceeding before, any Taxing Authority unless required to do so by a
"determination" as defined in Section 1313 of the Code; _provided, however_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority based upon or
arising out of the Allocation Schedule, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be
required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Taxing Authority challenging such Allocation Schedule.

 



 

2.5 _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Seller or any
other Person such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under
the Code, or any Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall notify Seller of any amounts
otherwise payable to Seller that it intends to deduct and withhold at least
two Business Days prior to the due date for any relevant payment other than
withholdings required as a result of Sellers failure to comply with Section
8.2(a)(iii). The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and properly remitted
to the applicable Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the Execution Date through the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice
and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Seller shall afford to the Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records, the
right to copy) to all of the Sellers properties, books, contracts, records
and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accounting firms, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives. None of the Buyers access hereunder shall include the
collection or analysis of samples, or any invasive or subsurface investigation
of environmental media or property.

 



 

(b) This _Section 6.2_ shall not require the Seller to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, (i) which Seller reasonably believes it is
prohibited from providing to the Buyer by reason of applicable Law, which
constitutes or allows access to

 



     

 

 



 

information protected by attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine
or which the Seller is required to keep confidential or prevent access to by
reason of any Contract with or duty to any third party, (ii) relating to
pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such
documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by legal counsel
to the Seller, would reasonably be expected to result in regulatory concerns
for the Seller or any of its Affiliates, (iii) relating to any potential sale
of the Seller, the Acquired Assets or the Business to any other Person, or
(iv) if the Seller or its Affiliates, on the hand, and the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, such
information being reasonably pertinent thereto.

 



 

(c) Any inspection or investigation conducted by the Buyer or its
Representatives prior to the Closing will be conducted in accordance with
applicable Laws, including any applicable Environmental Laws, and in such
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Seller or the Business. The Seller (and its Affiliates and Representatives)
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if
any) provided pursuant to this _Section 6.2_, and no Person (including the
Buyer) may rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case other
than, as expressly provided for in and subject to the limitations of this
Agreement, to the extent expressly part of the Sellers representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ or _Article IV_.

 



 

(d) If the Buyer exercises its rights of access under this _Section 6.2_ or
otherwise, or conducts examinations or inspections under this _Section 6.2_
or otherwise, then (i) such access, examination and inspection will be at the
Buyers sole risk, cost and expense and the Buyer waives and releases, on
behalf of itself and each Person undertaking any such examination or
inspection on Buyers behalf, all Losses and other claims against the Seller
and its Representatives (collectively the " ** _Inspection Indemnitees_** ")
arising in any way therefrom or in any way related thereto and (ii) except to
the extent of an Inspection Indemnitees willful misconduct, the Buyer will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Inspection Indemnitees from and
against any and all Losses and other claims of any kind or character resulting
directly or indirectly from the undertaking of any such examination or
inspection. **THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION WILL APPLY WHETHER OR
NOT SUCH DAMAGES OR OTHER CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF (I) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE
NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF THE
SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR (II) STRICT LIABILITY.** Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the provisions of this
_Section 6.2(d)_ will survive the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article IX_ and the Closing.

 



 

(e) Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Buyer and its Representatives will hold all information
received from the Seller pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ in confidence in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



      

 

 



 

6.3 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_. Prior to
the Closing, the Buyer and its Representatives shall not contact or
communicate with the employees (except the executive officers), customers,
suppliers and other business relations of the Seller or the Business in
connection with, or relating in any way to, the transactions contemplated
hereby, without the prior written consent of the Seller. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prevent the Buyer and
its Representatives from contacting any Person in the ordinary course of
business for matters unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or from conducting general market diligence.

 



 

6.4 _Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
6.4(e)_), each of the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate with the other and
use (and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Sellers
Subsidiaries and Affiliates and the Buyers Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
respectively, to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, such actions, and do, or cause to be done, such things, necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable
under the circumstances, the transactions contemplated hereby, including
preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, Notifications, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
(including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws), (ii) obtain promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date)
and maintain all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations

any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) transfer or assign, to
the extent transferable or assignable, to the Buyer, or have reissued in the
Buyers name, all Authorizations with respect to the Acquired Assets, and (v)

Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.4(a)_ shall require the Seller or any
of its Affiliates to make any payments to any Third Person (or, with respect
to clause (iv), Governmental Authority) in connection with obtaining any
consent, approval, or waiver relating to fulfilling its obligations under this
_Section 6.4(a)_.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each Party
(including by their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) agrees to make
appropriate filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Harvest
Purchase Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten
Business Days after the Execution Date (unless a later date is mutually agreed
to by the Parties) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental
Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by
their respective Subsidiaries), such other actions as are consistent with this
_Section 6.4_ necessary to cause the expiration

 



     

 

 



 

or termination of all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date); and (ii) each
Party shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) take all
action reasonably necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable
to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize
the effect of such Law on the transactions. The Parties shall request early
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act. Neither Party
will commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or
extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any
filing fees due to a Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law with
respect to all antitrust filings shall be split equally between the Buyer and
the Seller.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties shall use (and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Sellers Subsidiaries and Affiliates and the Buyers Subsidiaries
and Affiliates to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon in advance, and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, including any Proceeding initiated by
a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the other Party of (and supply to the
other Party) any communication received by such Party from, or given by such
Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and any material
communication received or given in connection with any Proceeding by a private
Person, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) permit the other Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith and incorporate the other Partys reasonable views and comments in,
any filing, presentation, submission, proposal or communication to be
submitted or given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to
obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) coordinate with the other Party in
preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other Party
(and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations, submissions,
proposals and other communications (and a summary of any oral presentations or
communications) made by such Party with any Governmental Authority relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law
and (v) consult with the other Party prior to taking any material position
with respect to the filings under any Antitrust Law, in any submissions to or
in any discussions with or filings to be submitted to any Governmental
Authority. Subject to _Section 6.2(b)_, the Parties shall take commercially
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege.

 



 

(d) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, each Party shall (i) to the extent reasonably practicable, not
participate in or

 



     

 

 



 

attend any meeting, or engage in any conversation with any Governmental
Authority in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
without the other Party, (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, give the
other Party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation and
(iii) if one such Party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Authority from participating or attending any such meeting or
engaging in any such conversation, keep such non-participating Party apprised
with respect thereto.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Buyer, the Parent or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates be
required to (and the Seller and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not
without the Buyers prior written consent) offer, negotiate, consent to, agree
to, or effect any condition, remedy or other action or agreement in order to
obtain the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period pursuant
to the HSR Act, to effect the dissolution of any injunctions, temporary
restraining order or other order, to avoid or resolve any Claim, or to obtain
any Authorization, consent, clearance, approval or authorization of any
Governmental Authority, including, but not limited to, proposing, negotiating,
committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture, transfer, license or other disposition
of any Acquired Assets or any assets, properties or business of the Buyer,
Parent, or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any interests therein, (ii)
the entry into any other arrangements, restrictions or limitations on conduct,
ownership or operation of any Acquired Assets or any assets, properties or
business of the Buyer, Parent, or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (iii)

commercial relationships of any Acquired Assets or of the Buyer, Parent, or
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Buyer, Parent or their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to defend through litigation or other
means any claim asserted in court, or with any other Governmental Authority,
by any Person that challenges the transactions contemplated hereby or that
would delay, restrict, condition, prohibit or prevent the Closing from
occurring or otherwise prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.5 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be
filed), all Tax Returns with respect to Asset Taxes for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (the " ** _Seller Prepared Tax Returns_** ") and shall pay all Taxes
shown as due and owing thereon.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns with respect
to Asset Taxes for all Straddle Periods (the " ** _Buyer Prepared Tax
Returns_** ") and shall pay all Taxes shown as due and owing thereon. Not
later than thirty days prior to the due date for filing any such Buyer
Prepared Tax Return, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together
with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to Seller for Sellers
review and reasonable comment. Buyer will cause such Buyer Prepared Tax
Return, as revised to incorporate Sellers reasonable comments, to be timely
filed and will provide a copy of such as-filed Tax Return to Seller. Not later
than two days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any
Buyer Prepared Tax Returns, Seller shall pay to

 



     

 

 



 

Buyer the amount of any Taxes for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date (determined in accordance with _Section 6.5(c)_) with
respect to such Tax Returns, except to the extent such Taxes were specifically
reflected as a liability in the Closing Date Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_.

 



 

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Asset Taxes
allocable to the portion of the Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall,
with respect to Taxes that are not based upon or measured by income,
activities or events, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in such Straddle Period. The amount of any other Asset
Taxes for a Straddle Period that relate to the portion of the Tax period
ending on the Closing Date will be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) _Refunds_. If Buyer receives an Asset Tax refund or applies a credit
against Asset Taxes, which refund or credit arises from or is attributable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such refund or the amount of such credit shall be
paid to the Seller, except to the extent such refund or credit was
specifically reflected as an asset in the Closing Date Net Working Capital, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit
examinations and any administrative or judicial Proceedings relating to the
Tax liabilities imposed with respect to the Acquired Assets for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, the Parties shall cooperate fully with
each other, including the furnishing or making available during normal
business hours of records, information, personnel (as reasonably required),
books of account, powers of attorney or other materials reasonably relevant or
helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit
examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the
imposition of Taxes. The Parties agree to: (i) retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Assets relating to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and any extension thereof for the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority; and (ii) give the other Party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if a Party so requests, such Party shall allow the other Party to
take possession of, or (if elected by the other Party) copy, such books and
records. The Seller shall have the right to direct and control any audits,
examinations, claims for refund, administrative proceedings, and judicial
proceedings that relate to Taxes with respect to any Acquired Asset (" ** _Tax
Contests_** ") that relate solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or for which the
Buyer would be entitled to make a Claim for indemnification under _Section
10.2(a)_; _provided, however_ , that if the conduct or settlement of any such
Tax Contests would reasonably be expected to result in or otherwise adversely
affect any Taxes of the Buyer for any Tax period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing, the Seller shall keep the Buyer reasonably
informed as to the progress of any such Tax Contest and shall not enter into
any settlement or compromise thereof in any manner that would reasonably be
expected to result in or otherwise affect any Taxes with respect to any
Acquired Asset for any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing

 



     

 

 



 

without the Buyers prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer shall have the sole
right to control all other Tax Contests.

 



 

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, all Transfer Taxes shall be borne by the Buyer. The Buyer and the
Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any such Transfer Tax that could be imposed.

 



 

(g) _Treatment of Indemnity and Other Payments_. All indemnity and other
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes as adjustments to the Final Cash Purchase Price, except as
otherwise required by Law.

 



 

(h) In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of _Section
6.5(e)_ and _Section 10.4_, the provisions of _Section 6.5(e)_ shall
control.

 



 

6.6 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.6_, from the Execution Date
through the Closing Date, all risk of loss or damage to the property included
in the Acquired Assets shall be borne by Seller, and thereafter shall be borne
by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall assume
all risk of loss with respect to the depreciation of tangible Acquired Assets
due to ordinary wear and tear, and Buyer shall not assert such matters as (and
such matters shall be deemed not to be) casualty losses hereunder.

 



 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Acquired Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty and the
aggregate loss as a result of such casualty together with all other casualty
losses equals or is less than $500,000 based on the fair market value of the
affected Acquired Assets, then Buyer nevertheless will not be relieved, solely
by virtue of such loss, of its obligation to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and Seller, at Closing, will pay to Buyer all
sums paid to Seller by third parties by reason of such casualty to the extent
(and only to the extent) attributable to the Acquired Assets and shall assign,
transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right,
title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other
rights against third parties arising out of such casualty to the extent (and
only to the extent) attributable to the Acquired Assets; _provided, however_ ,
that Seller will reserve and retain (and Buyer will assign to Seller) all
rights, title and interests and claims against third parties for the recovery
of Sellers costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or
asserting any such insurance claims or other rights against third parties.

 



 

(c) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Acquired Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, and the
aggregate loss as a result of such casualty together with all other casualty
losses exceeds $500,000 based on the fair market value of the affected
Acquired Assets, then Buyer nevertheless will not be relieved, solely by
virtue of such loss, of its obligation to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (i) Seller may, prior to Closing, cause the
Acquired

 



     

 

 



 

Assets affected by any such casualty to be repaired, replaced or restored to
Buyers reasonable satisfaction to at least the same condition as such
Acquired Assets were in prior to such casualty, at Sellers sole cost, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing
Date) and (ii) to the extent Seller elects not repair, replace or restore the
affected Acquired Assets prior to Closing pursuant to _Section 6.6(c)(i)_,
Seller shall elect to either (x) if covered by insurance, pay to Buyer all
insurance proceeds actually received (or as they are subsequently received) by
Seller with respect to such Casualty Loss, or (y) reduce Cash Consideration by
the estimated replacement cost (as reasonably agreed by Seller and Buyer) of
the Acquired Assets affected by such casualty to the same condition as such
Acquired Assets were in prior to such casualty, _provided, however,_ if Seller
elects, prior to the Closing Date, to cause such Acquired Assets affected by
such casualty to be repaired, replaced or restored and such work extends
beyond the Closing Date, Seller shall not be obligated to pay to Buyer any
insurance proceeds, and the Cash Consideration shall not be reduced at
Closing, with respect to such Casualty Loss. To the extent Seller does not
elect to pay to Buyer the insurance proceeds actually received with respect to
a casualty loss pursuant to this _Section 6.6(c)_, Seller will retain all
rights to insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against third
parties with respect to the casualty except to the extent the Parties
otherwise agree in writing (the " ** _Retained Claims_** ").

 



 

(d) In the event the Parties are unable to agree upon (i) the amount of the
loss attributable to any individual casualty or (ii) the amount of the costs
and expenses to repair, replace or restore any Acquired Assets affected by a
casualty, then any such amount shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in a
manner consistent with the provisions of _Section 2.3(c)_.

 



 

(e) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Acquired Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain,
then the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the awards paid or payable to
Seller in any condemnation or eminent domain action for the Acquired Assets so
taken. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be entitled to retain any such
awards paid or payable to Seller.

 



 

(f) If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is
pending or threatened with respect to any Acquired Asset or portion thereof
after the Execution Date, but no taking of such Acquired Asset or portion
thereof occurs prior to the Closing Date, then Buyer shall be required to
close and at Closing, Seller will assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or
subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in such
condemnation or eminent domain action, including any future awards therein, to
the extent (and only to the extent) attributable to the Acquired Assets
threatened to be taken, except that Seller will reserve and retain (and Buyer
will assign to Seller) all rights, titles, interests and claims against third
parties for the recovery of Sellers costs and expenses incurred prior to the
Closing in defending or asserting rights in such action with respect to the
Acquired Assets.

 



     

 

 



 

6.7 _R andW Insurance Policy_.

 



 

(a) As of the Execution Date, the Buyer has entered into a binder agreement
(the " ** _Binder Agreement_** ") with a representation and warranty insurer
(or agent thereto) providing for a summary of conditional coverage of a buyer-
side representation and warranty insurance policy (the " ** _R andW Insurance
Policy_**") a copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in the
Binder Agreement to ensure that the RandW Insurance Policy is fully bound and in
full force and effect at the Closing. The Buyer shall not amend, modify or
otherwise change, terminate or waive all or any portion of the Binder
Agreement or the RandW Insurance Policy in any manner that is adverse to the
Seller without the prior written consent of the Seller.

 



 

(b) The cost of obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy, including all premiums and
any related brokers fees, shall be paid by the Buyer.

 



 

(c) The Parties agree that none of the Seller Indemnitees shall be liable to
the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy for subrogation claims pursuant to
the RandW Insurance Policy, and the Buyer covenants and agrees that the RandW
Insurance Policy will include a waiver of such subrogation claims for the
benefit of the Seller Indemnitees, except in the case of Fraud by such Seller
Indemnitee.

 



 

6.8 _Employees_.

 



 

(a) As of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of
the Buyer to, extend good faith offers of employment to each individual who is
employed by the Seller on the Closing Date except that the Buyer may, but
shall not be obligated, to extend offers to the individuals described on
_Schedule 6.8(a)_. Each such individual that receives and accepts an offer of
employment in accordance with this _Section 6.8(a)_ shall be referred to
herein as a " ** _Transferred Employee_**". Employment with Buyer for
Transferred Employees shall commence immediately following the Closing Date.
Each such good faith offer extended in accordance with this _Section 6.8(a)_
shall contain terms of employment equal to or better than those described in
this _Section 6.8_.

 



 

(b) For no less than the 12-month period immediately following the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each
Transferred Employee with (i) base salary and wages and target, short-term
bonus and incentive compensation that are, in the aggregate, not less than the
base salary or wages and target, short-term bonus compensation provided either
(at the election of Buyer) to the Transferred Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date or to similarly situated employees of the Buyer, and (ii)
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to or
better in the aggregate than the benefits provided either to the Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date or to similarly situated
employees of the Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this
_Section 6.8_, a "similarly situated employee of the Buyer" shall mean, with
respect to the applicable Transferred Employee, as reasonably determined by
the Buyer, employees of the Buyer or its employing Affiliate holding an
equivalent or comparable position in the same or a comparable geographic
region as such Transferred Employee.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) In the event Buyer terminates the employment of any Transferred Employee
without cause during the 12-month period described in _Section 6.8(b)_, the
Buyer will, without duplication, pay and provide severance payments and
benefits to such Transferred Employee in an amount at least equal to the
greater of (i) the amount of severance in accordance with the Buyers employee
severance program and (ii) two weeks salary (up to a maximum of eight weeks
and based upon the highest salary provided to such employee during their
employment) for each year of service with the Seller, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates prior to and after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) From and after Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall cause each of
its employee benefit plans to give each Transferred Employee full credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, and also for purposes of
determining level of benefits under vacation or paid time off entitlement and
severance benefit plans, for all service with the Seller or its Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not
be credited to the extent it was not recognized by the Seller prior to the
Closing Date under a corresponding Target Company Benefit Plan or if it would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, from and after Closing the
Buyer and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i)
cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under each of its employee benefit plans, and (ii) cause any
eligible expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee and his or her covered
dependents, during the portion of the plan year in which the Closing occurs,
under those health and welfare benefit plans in which such Transferred
Employee currently participates to be taken into account under those health
and welfare benefit plans in which such Transferred Employee participates
subsequent to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year. Following the Closing, the Buyer will honor all accrued but unused
vacation and other paid time off of the Transferred Employees, including, for
the avoidance of doubt any paid time off that any Transferred Employee has
accrued and carried over into a subsequent year.

 



 

(e) The Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for complying
with the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code with respect to any
Transferred Employee (or spouse or dependent thereof) who is a "MandA qualified
beneficiary," as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9; provided that, the Buyer and the Seller will work in good faith to
determine and ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 4980B of the
Code with respect to any other "MandA qualified beneficiaries" that are not
Transferred Employees (or spouse or dependent thereof).

 



 

(f) The Seller shall take all actions as may be reasonably necessary to
provide that all amounts payable under the LTIP shall be paid by the Seller to
the participants therein at or after the Closing, which amounts shall be in
full satisfaction of all obligations and liabilities of any kind that the
Seller may have in connection with the LTIP.

 



 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including any Transferred
Employee), other than the Parties to this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of
this _Section 6.8_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement (including any Buyer benefit plan or Target Company
Benefit Plan); (ii) shall, subject to compliance with the other provisions of
this _Section 6.8_, alter or limit the Buyers ability to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement (including any
Buyer benefit plan or Target Company Benefit Plan); (iii) is intended to
confer upon any Transferred Employee any right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to
a particular term or condition of employment; or (iv) limit the right of the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at
any time.

 



 

(h) Without duplication of the Change-in-Control Payments Amount or the
Closing Transaction Expenses, the Seller agrees, upon Buyers reasonable
request, to facilitate discussions between Buyer and employees of the Seller a
reasonable time in advance of the Closing Date regarding employment,
retention, consulting or other arrangements to be effective following the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer and the Seller
acknowledge and agree that as of the Closing Date, the Buyer will assume
sponsorship of and receive and be responsible for all assets and liabilities
under the Sellers tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan (the "
** _Seller 401(k) Plan_**"). Prior to and after the Closing, the Buyer and
the Seller will take all actions necessary to transfer the sponsorship of, and
all assets and liabilities under, the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Buyer,
provided, however, that subject to and without limiting the first sentence of
this _Section 6.8(i)_, if requested by the Buyer, the Seller will adopt
resolutions terminating, and will take all other actions reasonably requested
by the Buyer to terminate, the Seller 401(k) plan, effective as of immediately
prior to the Closing but conditioned upon the Closing.

 



 

6.9 _Conduct of Buyer_. From the Execution Date until the earlier to occur of
(A) the Closing Date and (B) the date this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_, the Buyer shall not, and each shall cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, persuade or seek to persuade
any then-existing customer or supplier of the Seller or the Business to cease
to do business or to reduce the amount of business which that Person is doing
with the Seller or the Business, as applicable.

 



 

6.10 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including all legal, accounting, financial
advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third parties incurred
by a Party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be the obligation of the respective Party incurring such fees
and expenses.

 



     

 

 



 

6.11 _Retention of Records by the Seller_.

 



 

(a) The Seller, its members and their respective Affiliates shall have the
right to retain (i) photocopies of all books and records, including all Tax
Returns and other information and documents relating to Taxes, related to the
Business, in each case, relating to periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (A) as required by any Governmental Authority,
including any applicable Law or regulatory request or (B) as may be reasonably
necessary for the Seller, its members and their respective Affiliates to
perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, (ii) all data room materials, photocopies of bids and
all books and records (including any financial analysis relating to such bids)
prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (A) any books and records that may be relevant in connection with
any indemnity claims arising under this Agreement or the defense of disputes
arising under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or (B) financial
information and all other accounting books and records prepared or used in
connection with the preparation of financial statements of the Seller, its
members or their respective Affiliates, (iii) any books and records to the
extent reasonably necessary to prepare the Sellers, its members and their
respective Affiliates financial statements and Tax Returns, and (iv) any
books and records identified as an Excluded Asset (collectively, the " **
_Records_** "). Additionally, for a period of four years after the Closing
Date, the Buyer will grant to the Seller (or its Representatives) reasonable
access following reasonable advance notice at all reasonable times to the
Records, and will afford the Seller and its Representatives the right to make
copies thereof at the Sellers sole expense to the extent reasonably necessary
to prepare the Sellers, its members or their respective Affiliates
financial statements or Tax Returns, or in connection with any third-party
inquiry, audit or investigation, any dispute or litigation or for such other
purpose as such Persons may reasonably request; _provided_ that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Buyer
or its employees. The Buyer will maintain the Records in accordance with the
Buyers document retention policies, and at least until the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) The Seller shall be permitted to retain any and all books and records
(including any electronic records) of the Seller that do not relate to the
operation of the Business (including, for the avoidance of doubt, books and
records to the extent related to the governance and ownership of the Seller,
and not such operations of the Business).

 



 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with each other prior to issuing any public announcement,
statement or other disclosure with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents. Except as required to comply with
applicable Law, neither Party nor its Affiliates shall issue any such public
announcement, statement or other disclosure without having first obtained the
prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Except as prohibited by applicable Law,
prior to the issuance of any public announcement, statement or other
disclosure by either Party, the other Party shall be afforded a reasonable
opportunity (and in any event at least 24 hours) to review such announcement,
statement or other disclosure and provide comments thereon, which comments
shall be considered in good faith by the issuing Party.

 



      

 

 



 

6.13 _Schedule Update_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall supplement or
amend, as applicable, and deliver updates to the Disclosure Schedules (each a
" ** _Schedule Update_** "), that it believes to its Knowledge are necessary
to complete or correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules or in any
representation or warranty of the Seller, as the case may be, that has been
rendered inaccurate or incomplete due to any change, event, effect or
occurrence since the Execution Date, whether or not such representation and
warranty has a reference to a Disclosure Schedule or is then-qualified by a
Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that any such Schedule Update shall not be
deemed to have amended the Disclosure Schedules for purposes of (i)
determining the Buyers indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section
10.2(b)_ or (ii) determining whether the conditions to the Closing set forth
in _Section 7.3(a)-(b)_ have been satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Buyer shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement and there shall not
otherwise be deemed a breach of this Agreement as a result of any Schedule
Updates that relate to any actions permitted by or taken in accordance with
_Section 6.1_.

 



 

6.14 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries unconditionally and irrevocably acquit, remise,
discharge and forever release the Seller, the Seller Related Parties and their
respective Representatives (collectively, the " ** _Seller Released Parties_**
") from any and all Claims and Liabilities, including those arising under any
Law or Contract, that arise out of, relate to or result from the Acquired
Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Business, in each case whether arising
prior to or after the Closing (the " ** _Released Claims and Liabilities_**
"). The Buyer Parties further covenant and agree not to bring or threaten to
bring or otherwise join in any Claim against any of the Seller Released
Parties relating to, arising out of or in connection with any Released Claims
and Liabilities, and the Buyer Parties represent that none of the Buyer
Parties or their respective Subsidiaries has assigned any such Claims to any
Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Released Claims and Liabilities
acquitted, remised, discharged and released pursuant to this _Section 6.14_
shall not include any obligation of the Seller or the Seller Related Parties
arising under this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 6.14_ shall serve
as a waiver of any rights of the Buyer under this Agreement, including any
rights that any Buyer Indemnitee has to be indemnified by the Seller for any
Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_. Each of the Seller Released Parties is
an express third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.14_. WITHOUT LIMITING
THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, THE FOREGOING RELEASE WILL APPLY WHETHER OR
NOT RELEASED CLAIMS AND LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF (I) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING
SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
NEGLIGENCE) OR (II) STRICT LIABILITY.

 



 

6.15 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) If Closing occurs, from and after Closing for a period of 24 months after
the Closing Date, the Seller, Hildebrand Enterprises, L.P. and their
respective Affiliates (collectively, the " ** _Seller Restricted Parties_** ")
shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, consult,
become employed by or participate in any manner in the ownership, management,
operation or control of, or consulting to, any business, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in any aspect of a
Competitive Business within the Restricted Territory, except that the Seller
Restricted Parties shall not be restricted from acquiring, directly or
indirectly, less than 5% of (i) the outstanding capital stock of any publicly
traded company or (ii) the outstanding limited partnership interests or
similar Equity Interests issued by a "private equity" or

 



     

 

 



 

similar fund for which such Seller Restricted Party does not participate in
management or investment decisions, in each case which is engaged in a
Competitive Business.

 



 

(b) If Closing occurs, from and after Closing for a period of 24 months after
the Closing Date, the Seller shall not knowingly cause, induce or encourage,
any actual or prospective customer, supplier or licensor of the Business to
terminate or adversely modify any such relationship, in each case, within or
with respect to the Restricted Territory.

 



 

(c) If Closing occurs, from and after Closing for a period of 24 months after
the Closing Date, the Seller shall not cause, solicit, induce or encourage any
employee, if any, of the Buyer to leave such employment or hire, employ or
otherwise engage any such individual; _provided, however_ , that nothing in
this _Section 6.15(c)_ shall restrict (i) any general advertisement or
solicitation that is not directed at employees of the Buyer, or (ii) the
employment of any person who responds to any such general advertisement or
solicitation or who contacts the Seller or one of its Affiliates on his or her
own initiative and without any direct or indirect solicitation in
contravention of the above restrictions.

 



 

(d) If Closing occurs, from and after Closing for a period of 24 months after
the Closing Date, each of the Parties will not, directly or indirectly
(including through one or more of its respective Affiliates), make any public
statement (or statement reasonably anticipated to be made public) with respect
any of the other Parties, their respective Affiliates or its or their
respective businesses, products or services, either in writing or orally, to
any Person other than a Party (including employees or former employees of the
Buyer, its Affiliates or any Person described in _Section 6.15(b)_) that
disparages, discredits, degrades or lowers the reputation of such Party or its
respective businesses, products or services, including the publication of
articles or press releases and interviews with individuals or institutions
engaged in the business of communication, publishing or broadcasting news,
opinion or other information, either on the record, off the record, or "on
background" unless provided with advance written authorization from such Party
to do so, or encourage or participate with any Person to make such statements.

 



 

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges, in connection with the covenants and
agreements in this _Section 6.15_, that (i) such covenants and agreements
impose a reasonable restraint in light of the activities and business and
current plans with respect thereto of the Buyer and the Seller, (ii) it is the
intention of the Parties that the entire goodwill of the Business be
transferred to the Buyer as part of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the goodwill existing between the Business, on the one hand, and its
clients, customers, suppliers, agents, employees, contractors, consultants,
and other Persons under contract or otherwise associated or doing business
with them, on the other hand, and (iii) such covenants and agreements are
supported by adequate consideration.

 



 

(f) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 6.15_ relate to
matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this _Section 6.15_ may cause irreparable
injury to the Buyer or the Seller, the amount of which may be impossible to
estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly,
the remedy at law for any breach of this _Section 6.15_ may be inadequate.
Therefore, the Buyer and the Seller will each be entitled to seek an
injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of
competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this _Section 6.15_
without

 



     

 

 



 

the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond whatsoever. The
rights and remedies provided by this _Section 6.15_ are cumulative and in
addition to any other rights and remedies which the Buyer may have under this
Agreement or at law or in equity. If the Buyer were to seek damages for any
breach of this _Section 6.15_, the portion of the Total Consideration which
is allocated by the Parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered
a measure of or limit on such damages. If it shall be judicially determined in
a final nonappealable judgment that the Seller has violated this _Section
6.15_, then the applicable period described in this _Section 6.15_ will
automatically be extended by a period of time equal in length to the period
during which such violation or violations occurred as determined by such
court.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable
judgment determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical
area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this
_Section 6.15_ is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a
lesser time period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant
feature which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and
not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable Party.

 



 

6.16 _Director Appointment_. The Parent covenants and agrees to take such
action, promptly following the Execution Date and prior to the Closing Date,
as is necessary to (i) increase the number of positions on the board of
directors of the Parent (the " ** _Board_** ") by one and (ii) cause Jeffery
D. Hildebrand or another individual designated by the Seller and reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer to be appointed to the Board until the next annual
meeting of stockholders of the Parent, in each case effective as of the
Closing Date and in accordance with the Board Representation Agreement.

 



 

6.17 _NYSE Listing_. The Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Equity Consideration to be approved for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange (the " ** _NYSE_** "), subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Closing Date.

 



 

6.18 _Equity Consideration; Legends_. The Seller agrees to the recording, so
long as the restrictions described in the legend are applicable and subject to
the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement regarding legend removal,
of the following legend on any book-entry notation or certificate evidencing
all or any portion of any shares of Parent Common Stock constituting a portion
of the Equity Consideration:

 



 

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED
STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE
OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF
SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM."

 



 

6.19 _[Reserved]_.

 



 

6.20 _Required Third-Party Consents_. To the extent that the Sellers rights
to or under any Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability are subject to a Required
Third-Party Consent which is not obtained by the Closing Date, this Agreement
shall not constitute an assignment or attempted

 



     

 

 



 

assignment of such Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability if an attempted
assignment would be a breach thereof or be unlawful. With respect to any such
Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability, for 15 months from and after the Closing,
the Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer and the Parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain such Required Third-Party Consent as
promptly as reasonably practicable. If any such Required Third-Party Consent
shall not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would be ineffective or
would impair Buyers rights to or under the applicable Acquired Asset or
Assumed Liability so that Buyer would not in effect acquire the benefit of
such Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability, the Seller shall cooperate for 15
months after Closing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law and the Acquired
Asset or Assumed Liability, with the Buyer in any other reasonable arrangement
designed to provide such benefits to the Buyer.

 



 

6.21 _Further Conveyances and Assumptions_. From time to time for 15 months
following the Closing, the Seller and the Buyer will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
conveyances, notices, assumptions, assignments, releases and other
instruments, and will take such further actions, as may be reasonably
necessary and reasonably requested by any Party to consummate more effectively
the conveyance, transfer and delivery to the Buyer and its respective
successors or assigns, of all of the Sellers rights, titles and interests in
and to the Acquired Assets, and the assumption by the Buyer of the Assumed
Liabilities and to otherwise make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

6.22 _Remittances and Erroneous Transfers; No Wrong Pocket_.

 



 

(a) If, at any time for 15 months after the Closing, the Seller receives any
notices, monies or amounts that are properly due, deliverable or owing to the
Buyer or attributable to the Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (or the purposes and intent of
this Agreement), the Seller shall as promptly as reasonably practicable remit,
or shall cause to be remitted, such notices, monies or amounts by notice to
the Buyer or by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account
or accounts of the Buyer and/or any Person that the Buyer designates in
writing, as applicable. For 15 months after the Closing, if the Buyer (or any
of its Affiliates) receives any notices, monies or amounts that are properly
due, deliverable or owing to the Seller or attributable to the Excluded Assets
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (or the purposes and intent of
this Agreement), the Buyer shall as promptly as reasonably practicable remit,
or shall cause to be remitted, such notices, monies or amounts by notice to
the Seller or by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account
or accounts designated in writing by the Seller, as applicable. For clarity,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Buyer shall be entitled to receive and shall be obligation to pay, fulfill or
discharge the Current Assets and the Current Liabilities, respectively.

 



 

(b) If, at any time for 15 months after the Closing, any Party becomes aware
that any asset, property, transferable Authorization, Contract or other right
with respect to the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities
held by the Seller should have been transferred to the Buyer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement (or the purposes and intent of this Agreement) or such
transfer is otherwise necessary to make true and correct any of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.13(d)_ (for purposes
of this _Section 6.22(b)_, without giving effect to the limitation indicated
by "Target Material

rights pursuant to this _Section 9.2(c)_ (and, during the pendency of any
proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the Seller seeking specific
performance of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not automatically
terminate or be terminable by the Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_), or
(B) terminate this Agreement and have the Buyer pay to the Seller in
immediately available funds by wire transfer no later than three Business Days
after termination of this Agreement a fee equal to the sum of $41,000,000,
plus (1) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the

the actual amount of damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure
accurately and that the Seller would not have entered into this Agreement
without the agreements in this _Section 9.2(c)_. The Sellers rights to
receive, and the Buyers obligations to pay or cause to be paid, the Buyer
Termination Fee hereunder shall terminate and expire in the event that the
Seller has not made a claim in writing to the Buyer for payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee on the date that is 20 days from the date of termination in
accordance with this _Section 9.2(c)_.

forth in _Section 10.2(a)(z)_ will survive without time limit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there will be no termination of any bona fide
claim asserted pursuant to the indemnities in _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section
10.2(b)_ prior to the date of termination for such indemnity.

 



     

 

 



 

10.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article X_, from and after the
Closing, the Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees in respect of, and
hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered,
incurred or sustained by any of them resulting from, arising out of or
relating to (x) any breach of any representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ and _Article IV_, (y) any nonfulfillment of or failure to
perform any covenant on the part of the Seller contained in this Agreement or
(z) Excluded Liabilities; _provided_ that in the case of claims made pursuant
to clause (x) or clause (y), solely to the extent that the Buyer does not
have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, recourse under the RandW
Insurance Policy in respect of the foregoing; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the following limitations shall apply:

 



 

(i) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
_clause (x)_ above (other than for breach of the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 4.4_), unless:

 



 

(A) with respect to each individual Claim, the Buyer Indemnitees,
collectively, have suffered or incurred Losses with respect to the individual
Claim or series of related Claims that arise out of substantially the same
facts and circumstances for which recovery is sought in excess of $200,000, in
which case the full amount of such Losses shall be recoverable, subject to the
limitations imposed by the other provisions of this _Article X_; and

 



 

(B) the Buyer Indemnitees, collectively, have suffered or incurred aggregate
Losses otherwise recoverable under this _Article X_ in an amount in excess of
the Indemnity Threshold, and then recovery shall be permitted only to the
extent of such Losses in excess of the Indemnity Threshold.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
provisions of this _Section 10.2(a)_ shall apply in such a manner as not to
give duplicative effect to any item of adjustment provided for elsewhere in
this Agreement, including _Section 2.3_. If there has been an adjustment to
the Final Cash Purchase Price for any Loss pursuant to _Section 2.3_, there
shall not be any charge against the Indemnity Threshold and no Indemnitee may
make a Claim under this _Section 10.2(a)_ with respect to any Loss that gave
rise to such adjustment.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article X_, from and after the
Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees in respect of, and
hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered,
incurred or sustained by any of them resulting from, arising out of or
relating to (x) any breach of any representation and warranty made by the
Buyer Parties, (y) any nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant on
the part of the Buyer Parties contained in this Agreement or (z) the Released
Claims and Liabilities or the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not, in the aggregate, be entitled to recover Losses from or
have any other

 



     

 

 



 

recourse against the Seller relating to any claim arising from this Agreement
in excess of, in the case of (i) any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ and _Article IV_, an amount equal to
the Indemnity Threshold, and (ii) for a failure to perform any covenant on the
part of the Seller contained in this Agreement, an amount equal to the Final
Cash Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) No Claim Notice for indemnification may be provided with respect to any
Claim for breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement
beyond the survival period specified in _Section 10.1_.

 



 

(e) For purposes of indemnification pursuant to this _Section 10.2_, any
qualification of representations or warranties set forth herein by reference
to materiality or "Target Material Adverse Effect" or similar materiality
qualification shall be disregarded in determining any breach thereof or the
amount of Losses resulting therefrom.

 



 

(f) Each Party shall cooperate with each of the other Parties with respect to
resolving any Claim, Liability or Loss for which indemnification may be
required hereunder, including by taking, or causing its Affiliates to take,
all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such Claim, Liability or
Loss (including incurring costs to the extent necessary to remedy the breach
that gives rise to the Loss). In the event a Party shall fail to take, or fail
to cause its Affiliates to take, such commercially reasonable efforts, then
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, recourse to
indemnification shall not be available to any Person for any Claim, Liability
or Loss that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if such steps
had been taken. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, EACH PARTY
SHALL, AND SHALL CAUSE ITS AFFILIATES TO, SEEK FULL RECOVERY UNDER ALL
INSURANCE POLICIES (INCLUDING THE RandW INSURANCE POLICY) COVERING ANY LOSS TO
THE SAME EXTENT AS THEY WOULD IF SUCH LOSS WERE NOT SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION
HEREUNDER.

 



 

10.3 _Computation of Indemnity Payment_. The amount payable under this
_Article X_ in respect of any Loss shall be calculated net of (a) any related
reserves set forth in the Financial Statements and (b) any insurance proceeds
or other amounts under indemnification agreements with Third Persons received
by the Indemnified Party on account thereof (collectively, " ** _Indemnity
Reduction Amounts_** "); _provided_ , that in each case, the Indemnified Party
shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain such insurance (and other) recoveries; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to assert any claims under this
_Article X_ with respect to any matters that would have been covered by
insurance had the Buyer maintained for the benefit of the Business and the
Acquired Assets the same insurance coverage following the Closing that was in
effect for the Business and the Acquired Assets immediately prior to the
Closing. If any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates receives any Indemnity
Reduction Amounts in respect of a Claim for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement after the full amount of such Claim has been paid by an
Indemnifying Party or after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment
of such Claim and such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid
balance of such Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount
theretofore paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Claim, _minus_
(ii) the amount of the indemnity

 



     

 

 



 

payment that would have been due if such Indemnity Reduction Amounts in
respect thereof had been received before the indemnity payment was made. An
insurer or other Third Person who would otherwise be obligated to pay any
Claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or,
solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any
subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and
agreed that no insurer or any other Third Person shall be entitled to any
benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the
indemnification provisions hereof by virtue of the indemnification provisions
hereof.

 



 

10.4 _Notice of Asserted Liability; Opportunity to Defend_.

 



 

(a) All claims for indemnification hereunder shall be asserted and handled
pursuant to this _Section 10.4_.

 



 

(b) If any Claim is asserted against or any Loss is sought to be collected
from an Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness (and in any event prior to the expiration of the relevant survival
period set forth in _Section 10.1_) provide to the Indemnifying Party a Claim
Notice. The failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it of
any Liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party with respect to such
Claim or Loss except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced
by such failure or to the extent the Claim Notice was provided after the
expiration of the relevant survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from receipt of the Claim Notice
(the " ** _Notice Period_** ") to notify the Indemnified Party in writing (i)
whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes the Liability to the
Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to the Claim or Loss, (ii) in any
case in which Losses are asserted against or sought to be collected from an
Indemnifying Party by an Indemnified Party, whether or not the Indemnifying
Party desires at its own sole cost and expense to attempt to remedy such
Losses, or (iii) in any case in which Claims are asserted against or sought to
be collected from an Indemnified Party by a Third Person (" ** _Third-Person
Claim_** "), whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires at its own sole
cost and expense to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Person
Claim.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Person
Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all
appropriate Proceedings with counsel of its own choosing (but reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) and such Proceedings shall be
diligently prosecuted by it to settlement or a final conclusion. If the
Indemnified Party desires to participate in any such defense or settlement,
other than at the request of the Indemnifying Party, then it may do so at its
sole cost and expense. If the Indemnified Party joins in defending in any such
Third-Person Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have full authority to
determine all action to be taken with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Person Claim
or does not provide an answer within the Notice Period, then the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of all appropriate Proceedings
related thereto with counsel of its choosing and the Indemnifying Party shall
be responsible for paying for counsel for the Indemnified Party if it is
otherwise entitled to indemnification

 



     

 

 



 

with respect to such matter. If a Proceeding is asserted against both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and there are defenses available
to the Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying Party or
there is a conflict of interest that renders it inappropriate for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for paying for one separate
counsel group for the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
there is more than one Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
responsible for paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys (in
addition to local counsel) to represent the Indemnified Parties, regardless of
the number of Indemnified Parties. No compromise or settlement of any
Proceeding may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys written consent unless (i) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) such
settlement includes the granting by each claimant or plaintiff to each
Indemnified Party of an unconditional release from all Liability in respect of
such Third-Person Claim and the related Proceeding.

 



 

(e) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, at the cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, in contesting any Third-Person Claim, in making any
counterclaim against the Third Person asserting the Third-Person Claim or in
making any cross-complaint against any Person. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no Third-Person Claim may be settled or
otherwise compromised without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.

 



 

(f) The costs and expenses of a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee,
including the fees, costs, and expenses of its separate Representatives
engaged by it, incurred in connection with the defense and settlement or
resolution of any Third-Person Claim as to which such Buyer Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, has the right to control shall be
treated as "Losses" for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

(g) If any Buyer Indemnitee receives any payment in respect of any Losses
pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ and such Buyer Indemnitee could have recovered
all or a part of such Losses from a Third Person (a " ** _Potential
Contributor_** "), such Buyer Indemnitee shall assign, on a non-recourse basis
and without any representation or warranty, such of its rights to proceed
against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Seller to
recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment. If any such
assignment would afford the Potential Contributor any defense to the payment
of the same, such assignment shall not take place and such Buyer Indemnitee
will, at the Sellers direction, take all reasonable actions to seek to
recover such claim from such Potential Contributor. Any payment received in
respect of such claim against the Potential Contributor (whether by the Seller
or the relevant Buyer Indemnitee as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence) shall be distributed, (i) first, to the Buyer Indemnitee in the
amount of any deductible or similar amount required to be paid by such Buyer
Indemnitee prior to the Seller being required to make any payment to such
Buyer Indemnitee, _plus_ , in the case of any claim by a Buyer Indemnitee as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or
otherwise addressing such claim, (ii) second, to the appropriate Indemnifying
Party in an amount equal to the reasonable out-of-pocket

 



     

 

 



 

costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or
otherwise addressing such claim, and (iii) third, the balance, if any, to the
Buyer Indemnitee.

 



 

10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. SUBJECT TO _SECTION 10.6_, AS BETWEEN THE BUYER
INDEMNITEES AND THE SELLER, ON ONE HAND, AND THE SELLER INDEMNITEES AND THE
BUYER, ON THE OTHER, AFTER THE CLOSING, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO ADJUSTMENTS
PURSUANT TO _SECTION 2.3_ OR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE PURSUANT TO _SECTION
11.12_, THE FOLLOWING SHALL APPLY:

ARE ENTITLED TO ANY REMEDIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AGREEMENT EMBODIES THE
JUSTIFIABLE EXPECTATION OF SOPHISTICATED PARTIES DERIVED FROM ARMS LENGTH
NEGOTIATIONS AND NO PARTY HAS ANY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER PARTY THAT
WOULD JUSTIFY ANY EXPECTATION BEYOND THAT OF AN ORDINARY BUYER AND AN ORDINARY
SELLER IN AN ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
BREACH OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE THOSE
REMEDIES AVAILABLE AT LAW UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO THIS _ARTICLE X_;
AND THE PARTIES WAIVE AND RELEASE ANY AND ALL TORT CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION
THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY TORT
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS
AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT), INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS
ARISING UNDER CERCLA OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH OR SAFETY MATTER.
WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES FOR ANY AND ALL (I) CLAIMS RELATING
TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT,

 



     

 

 



 

(II) OTHER CLAIMS PURSUANT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND (III)
OTHER CLAIMS RELATING TO THE INTERESTS AND THE PURCHASE AND SALE THEREOF SHALL
BE ANY RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION FROM SUCH CLAIMS THAT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, AND IF NO SUCH RIGHT OF INDEMNIFICATION IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED,
THEN SUCH CLAIMS ARE WAIVED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

 



 

10.6 _Special Rule for Fraud and Willful Breach_. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Article X_ to the contrary, in the event of any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation by any party
hereto in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby that constitutes Willful Breach or Fraud, by or on behalf of (x) the
Seller (including any Willful Breach or Fraud committed by any Affiliate,
officer, director, employee or agent of the Seller in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (y) the
Buyer (including any Willful Breach or Fraud committed by any Affiliate,
officer, director, employee or agent of the Buyer in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), then (a)
such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation will survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and will continue in full force and effect
for the period of the applicable statute of limitations without regard to the
termination of any survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_, (b) the
limitations set forth in this _Article X_ shall not apply to any Loss that
any Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee may suffer, sustain or become
subject to, as a result of, arising out of, relating to or in connection with
any such breach, and (c) none of such Losses shall be subject to or shall
count towards the satisfaction of the Indemnity Threshold or be limited in
recovery to the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

10.7 _Express Negligence Rule_. THE INDEMNIFICATION AND WAIVER PROVISIONS IN
THIS _ARTICLE X_ SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM
WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
CONTRIBUTORY, OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION
OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT
BY SUCH PERSON. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS _ARTICLE
X_ COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS KNOWN AS THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE. THE
PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT A PARTY IS SOMETIMES AN
INDEMNIFYING PARTY AND SOMETIMES AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH INDEMNIFYING PARTY
REPRESENTS TO THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY (A) THAT IT, THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY, HAS
CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT OR, IF IT HAS NOT CONSULTED AN
ATTORNEY, THAT IT WAS PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY AND HAD THE ABILITY TO SO
CONSULT, BUT MADE AN INFORMED DECISION NOT TO DO SO, AND (B) THAT IT, THE
INDEMNIFYING PARTY, FULLY UNDERSTANDS ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

obligations arising hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
Party. Subject to the preceding sentences of this _Section 11.1_, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 11.1_ shall be null
and void. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 11.1_,
the Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of

specifically stating that it amends, supersedes or cancels this Agreement. Any
of the terms of this Agreement and any condition to a Partys obligations
hereunder may be waived only in writing by that Party specifically stating
that it waives a term or condition hereof. No waiver by a Party of any one or
more conditions or defaults by the other in performance of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver of any
future conditions or defaults, whether of a like or different character, nor
shall the waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided in writing.

 



 

11.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with any Exhibits and
Schedules hereto) and all certificates, documents, instruments, and writings
that are delivered pursuant to this Agreement contain the entire understanding
of the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and
supersede all prior agreements, arrangements, and understandings

 



     

 

 



 

relating to the subject matter hereof other than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which is hereby ratified by the Parties.

 



 

11.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the

Agreement, and each Party irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
such dispute may be heard and determined in such courts. The Parties
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement brought in such courts or any
defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the
Parties agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND, THEREFORE, EACH OF THE PARTIES
KNOWINGLY AND

event or circumstance, that such item has had, or is expected to result in, a

amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or

higher or lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use the
fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such
item in the Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the
Parties as to whether any obligation, item, or matter not described in this
Agreement or included in a Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for

(a) _Shelf Registration_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) prepare and file an initial registration statement under the
Securities Act prior to the date that is six (6) months after the date hereof
to permit the resale of Registrable Securities from time to time as permitted
by Rule 415 (or any similar provision adopted by the Commission then in
effect) of the Securities Act (a " _Registration Statement_ ") and (ii) cause
such initial Registration Statement to become effective as soon as practicable
after filing thereof and in no event later than the date that is six (6)
months after the date hereof (the " _Target Effective Date_ "). The Company
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)_ to be continuously
effective under the Securities Act, with respect to any Holder, until the date
on which there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding (the "
_Effectiveness Period_ "). A Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
_Section 2.01(a)_ shall be on such appropriate registration form of the
Commission as shall be selected by the Company; _provided that_ , if the
Company is then eligible, it shall file such Registration Statement on Form
S-3. A Registration Statement when declared effective (including the documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (and, in the case of any prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances
under which a statement is made). As soon as practicable following the date
that a Registration Statement becomes effective, but in any event within three
Business Days of such date, the Company shall provide the Holders with written
notice of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. The Company shall
not be obligated to maintain more than one effective Registration Statement at
any given time pursuant to this _Section 2.01_.

 



 

(b) _Delay Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Company may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose Registrable
Securities are

 



 

EXHIBIT D-4    

 

 



 

included in a Registration Statement, suspend such Selling Holders use of any
prospectus which is a part of such Registration Statement (in which event the
Selling Holder shall suspend sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Registration Statement) if (i) the Company is pursuing an acquisition,
merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and the
Company determines in good faith that the Companys ability to pursue or
consummate such a transaction would be materially and adversely affected by
any required disclosure of such transaction in such Registration Statement, or
(ii) the Company or any of its Affiliates has experienced some other material
non-public event, the disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith
judgment of the Company, would materially and adversely affect the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Selling Holders be
suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement for a period that exceeds an aggregate of 60 days in any 180-day
period or 90 days in any 365-day period. Upon disclosure of such information
or the termination of the condition described above, the Company shall
promptly provide notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities
are included in such Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any
suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such other actions
necessary or appropriate to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities
as contemplated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of this _Section 2.01(b)_ shall apply to any Underwritten Offering undertaken
pursuant to _Section 2.03_.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(a) _Participation_. If at any time the Company proposes to file (i) a
Registration Statement (other than a Registration Statement contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)_) on behalf of any other Person who has registration rights
related to an Underwritten Offering (the " _Other Holder_ ") or (ii) a
prospectus supplement relating to the sale of shares of Company Common Stock
by any Other Holders pursuant to an effective registration statement, so long
as the Company is a WKSI at such time or, whether or not the Company is a
WKSI, so long as the Registrable Securities were previously included in the
underlying shelf Registration Statement or are included on an effective
Registration Statement, or in any case in which Holders may participate in
such offering without the filing of a post-effective amendment, in each case,
for the sale of shares of Company Common Stock by the Company and/or Other
Holders in an Underwritten Offering, then the Company shall give not less than
four Business Days notice (including, but not limited to, notification by
electronic mail) (the " _Piggyback Notice_ ") of such proposed Underwritten
Offering to each Holder that, together with its Affiliates, owns at least $15
million of Registrable Securities and such Piggyback Notice shall offer such
Holder the opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering for Other
Holders such number of Registrable Securities (the " _Included Registrable
Securities_ ") as such Holder may request in writing (a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to offer such opportunity (A) to such Holders if the Holders,
together with their Affiliates, do not offer a minimum of $15 million of
Registrable Securities, in the aggregate (determined by multiplying the number
of Registrable Securities owned by the average of the closing price on the
National Securities Exchange for shares of Company Common Stock for the 10
trading days preceding the date of such Piggyback Notice), or such lesser
amount if it constitutes the remaining holdings of the Holder and its
Affiliates, or (B) to such Holders if and to the extent that the Company has
been advised by the Managing Underwriter in writing that the inclusion of
Registrable Securities for sale for the benefit of such Holders will have an
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the shares of Company
Common Stock in such Underwritten Offering, then the amount of Registrable
Securities to be offered for the accounts of

 



 

EXHIBIT D-5    

 

 



 

Holders shall be determined based on the provisions of _Section 2.02(b)_.
Each Piggyback Notice shall be provided to Holders on a Business Day pursuant
to _Section 3.01_ and receipt of such Piggyback Notice shall be confirmed and
kept confidential by the Holders until either (x) such proposed Underwritten
Offering has been publicly announced by the Company or (y) the Holders have
received notice from the Company that such proposed Underwritten Offering has
been abandoned, which the Company shall provide to the Holders reasonably
promptly after the final decision to abandon such proposed Underwritten
Offering has been made. Each such Holder will have four Business Days (or two
Business Days in connection with any overnight or bought Underwritten
Offering) after such Piggyback Notice has been delivered to request in writing
to the Company the inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Underwritten
Offering for Other Holders. If no request for inclusion from a Holder is
received by the Company within the specified time or if a Holder states in its
response to the Piggyback Notice that it declines the opportunity to include
Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering, such Holder shall have no
further right to participate in such Underwritten Offering. If, at any time
after giving written notice of the Companys intention to undertake an
Underwritten Offering for Other Holders and prior to the pricing of such
Underwritten Offering, such Underwritten Offering is terminated or delayed
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company may, at its
election, give written notice of such determination to the Selling Holders
and, (1) in the case of a termination of such Underwritten Offering, shall be
relieved of its obligation to sell any Included Registrable Securities in
connection with such terminated Underwritten Offering, and (2) in the case of
a determination to delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to
delay offering any Included Registrable Securities for the same period as the
delay in the Underwritten Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to
withdraw such Selling Holders request for inclusion of such Selling Holders
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering by giving written notice
to the Company of such withdrawal at least one Business Day prior to the time
of pricing of such Underwritten Offering. Any Holder may deliver written
notice (a " _Piggyback Opt-Out Notice_ ") to the Company requesting that such
Holder not receive notice from the Company of any proposed Underwritten
Offering for Other Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Holder may
later revoke any such Piggyback Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following receipt
of a Piggyback Opt-Out Notice from a Holder (unless subsequently revoked), the
Company shall not be required to deliver any notice to such Holder pursuant to
this _Section 2.02(a)_ and such Holder shall no longer be entitled to
participate in any Underwritten Offering for Other Holders pursuant to this
_Section 2.02(a)_, unless such Piggyback Opt-Out Notice is revoked by such
Holder.

 



 

(b) _Priority of Piggyback Registration_. If the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering for Other Holders advise
the Company in writing that the total amount of Registrable Securities that
Holders intend to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be sold
in such offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price,
timing or distribution of the Registrable Securities offered or the market for
the shares of Company Common Stock, then the Company shall include the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that such Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters advise the Company can be sold without having such adverse
effect, with such number to be allocated (i) in the event that the Person that
initiated such Underwritten Offering is the Company, (A) first, to the
Company, (B) second, pro rata among (1) any Holders who are exercising
piggyback registration rights pursuant to this _Section 2.02_ related to such
offering and (2) any Persons owning shares of Company Common Stock, having
piggyback registration rights _pari passu_ to those of the Holders described
in this _Section 2.02(b)(i)(B)_ and exercising such piggyback registration
rights and (C)

 



 

EXHIBIT D-6    

 

 



 

third, pro rata among any Persons owning shares of Company Common Stock having
piggyback registration rights subordinate to those of the Holders and
exercising such piggyback registration rights and (ii) in the event that any
Person other than the Company initiated such Underwritten Offering, (A) first,
to the Person that initiated such Underwritten Offering, (B) second, pro rata
among (1) all other Holders who are exercising piggyback registration rights
pursuant to this _Section 2.02_ related to such offering and (2) any Persons
owning shares of Company Common Stock, having piggyback registration rights
_pari passu_ to those of the Holders described in this _Section 2.02(b)(ii)_
and exercising such piggyback registration rights and (C) third, pro rata
among the Company (to the extent that such Person was not the Person
initiating the Underwritten Offering on its own behalf) and Persons owning
shares of Company Common Stock having piggyback registration rights
subordinate to those of the Holders and exercising such piggyback registration
rights (it being understood that "pro rata," as used in this _Section 2.02_,
is based, for each such Person or Holder, as applicable, on the percentage
derived by dividing (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock proposed
to be sold by such Person or Holder, as applicable, in such offering by (y)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock proposed to be sold by
the Persons sharing in the same tier of pro rata allocation).

 



 

Section 2.03 _Underwritten Offering_.

 



 

(a) _S-3 Registration_. In the event that any Holder elects to dispose of
Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement pursuant to an
Underwritten Offering and either (i) reasonably expects gross proceeds of at
least $50 million from such Underwritten Offering (together with any
Registrable Securities to be disposed of by a Selling Holder who has elected
to participate in such Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.02_) or
(ii) reasonably expects gross proceeds of at least $25 million from such
Underwritten Offering (together with any Registrable Securities to be disposed
of by a Selling Holder who has elected to participate in such Underwritten
Offering pursuant to _Section 2.02_) and such Registrable Securities
represent 100% of the then outstanding Registrable Securities held by the
applicable Selling Holder and Affiliates, the Company shall, at the written
request of such Selling Holder(s), enter into an underwriting agreement in a
form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Company
with the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected by the Company after
consultation with the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities
included in such Underwritten Offering, which shall include, among other
provisions, indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in _Section
2.08_, and shall take all such other reasonable actions as are requested by
the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no Selling Holder may demand an Underwritten Offering within 90 days of
another Underwritten Offering; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Company or
its Affiliates are conducting or actively pursuing a securities offering of
shares of Company Common Stock with anticipated gross offering proceeds of at
least $50 million (other than in connection with any at-the-market offering or
similar continuous offering program), then the Company may suspend such
Selling Holders right to require the Company to conduct an Underwritten
Offering on such Selling Holders behalf pursuant to this _Section 2.03_;
_provided, however_ , that the Company shall have no obligation to facilitate
or participate in, including entering into any underwriting agreement for,
more than three Underwritten Offerings at the request of the Holders in any
365-day period; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may only suspend
such Selling Holders right to require the Company to conduct an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to this _Section _ _2.03_ once in any six-month period and
in no event for a period that exceeds an aggregate

 



 

EXHIBIT D-7    

 

 



 

of 45 days in any 180-day period or 75 days in any 365-day period; _provided,
further_ , that to the extent the Company suspends a Selling Holders right to
require the Company to conduct an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this
_Section _ _2.03_ , and either (x) (A) such Selling Holder subsequently
elects to participate in such Company Underwritten Offering pursuant to
_Section 2.02(a)_ and (B) the amount of Registrable Securities such Selling
Holder elects to sell by participating in such Company Underwritten Offering
is reduced (pursuant to _Section 2.02(b))_ by more than 50% or (y) such
Selling Holder does not, or is unable to, participate in such Company
Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_, such Selling Holder
shall not be subject to the 90 day prohibition described in this paragraph on
subsequent Underwritten Offerings until such Selling Holders next demand for
an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 2.03_.

 



 

(b) _General Procedures_. In connection with any Underwritten Offering
contemplated by _Section 2.03(a)_, the underwriting agreement into which each
Selling Holder and the Company shall enter shall contain such representations,
covenants, indemnities (subject to _Section 2.08_) and other rights and
obligations as are customary in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the
Company. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations or
warranties to, or agreements with, the Company or the Underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holders
authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and to sell, and its
ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf, its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by law. If any
Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an Underwritten Offering
contemplated by this _Section 2.03_, such Selling Holder may elect to
withdraw therefrom by notice to the Company and the Managing Underwriter;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such withdrawal must be made at least one
Business Day prior to the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering to be
effective; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event the Managing Underwriter
or Underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering advise the Company that
the total amount of Registrable Securities that Holders intend to include in
such offering exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without
being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of
the Common Unit Registrable Securities offered or the market for shares of
Company Common Stock, and the amount of Common Unit Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering by the Holder that
initiated such Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ (the "
_Initiating Holder_ ") is reduced by 50% or more, the Initiating Holder will
have the right to withdraw from such Underwritten Offering by delivering
notice to the Company at least one Business Day prior to the time of pricing
of such Underwritten Offering, in which case the Company will have no
obligation to proceed with such Underwritten Offering and such Underwritten
Offering, whether or not completed, will not decrease the number of
Underwritten Offerings the Initiating Holder shall have the right and option
to request under this _Section 2.03_. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall
affect the Companys obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

 



 

Section 2.04 _Further Obligations_. In connection with its obligations under
this _Article II_, the Company will:

 



 

(a) promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection

shall reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not

Following the provision of such notice, the Company agrees to, as promptly as

take other appropriate action so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement
does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

statements included or incorporated by reference into the applicable
registration statement, and each of the opinion and the "comfort letter" shall
be in customary form and covering substantially the same matters with respect
to such registration statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus

of the Company shall not be required to dedicate an unreasonably burdensome
amount of time in connection with any roadshow and related marketing
activities for any Underwritten Offering;

 



 

(o) if reasonably requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a

(q) if any Holder could reasonably be deemed to be an "underwriter," as
defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, in connection with the
Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereof (a " _Holder
Underwriter Registration Statement_ "), then reasonably cooperate with such
Holder in allowing such Holder to conduct customary "underwriters due
diligence" with respect to the Company and satisfy its obligations in respect
thereof. In addition, at any Holders request, the Company will furnish to
such Holder, on the date of the effectiveness of the Holder Underwriter

Securities pursuant to a Holder Underwriter Registration Statement), (i) a

certified public accountants in form and substance as has been customarily
given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in
Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Company, addressed to such Holder,

for purposes of the Holder Underwriter

 



 

EXHIBIT D-11

standard "10b-5" negative assurance for such offerings, addressed to such
Holder and (iii) a standard officers certificate from the chief executive
officer or chief financial officer, or other officers serving such functions,
of the Company addressed to the Holder, as has been customarily given by such

will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide legal counsel to
such Holder with an opportunity to review and comment upon any such Holder
Underwriter Registration Statement, and any amendments and supplements
thereto, prior to its filing with the Commission.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.04_, the Company
will not name a Holder as an underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of
the Securities Act) in any Registration Statement or Holder Underwriter
Registration Statement, as applicable, without such Holders consent. If the
staff of the Commission requires the Company to name any Holder as an
underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act), and such
Holder does not consent thereto, then such Holders Registrable Securities
shall not be included on the applicable Registration Statement, and the
Company shall have no further obligations hereunder with respect to
Registrable Securities held by such Holder, unless such Holder has not had an
opportunity to conduct customary underwriters due diligence as set forth in
_Section 2.04(q)_ with respect to the Company at the time such Holders
consent is sought.

 



 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Company of the happening
of any event of the kind described in _Section 2.04(f)_, shall forthwith
discontinue offers and sales of the Registrable Securities by means of a
prospectus or prospectus supplement until such Selling Holders receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by _Section
2.04(f)_ or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
prospectus may be resumed and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so
directed by the Company, such Selling Holder will, or will request the
Managing Underwriter or Managing Underwriters, if any, to deliver to the
Company (at the Companys expense) all copies in their possession or control,
other than permanent file copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of
the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of
receipt of such notice.

 



 

Section 2.05 _Cooperation by Holders_. The Company shall have no obligation to
include Registrable Securities of a Holder in a Registration Statement or in
an Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ if such Holder has
failed to timely furnish such information that the Company determines, after
consultation with its counsel, is reasonably required in order for any
registration statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to comply with
the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 2.06 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. Each Holder of Registrable Securities who is participating in an
Underwritten Offering agrees to enter into a customary letter agreement with
Underwriters providing that such Holder will not effect any public sale or
distribution of Registrable Securities during the 45 calendar day period
beginning on the date of a prospectus or prospectus supplement filed with the
Commission with respect to the pricing of such Underwritten Offering;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the duration
of the foregoing restrictions shall be no longer than the duration of the
shortest restriction imposed by the Underwriters on the Company or the
officers, directors or any other

 



 

EXHIBIT D-12    

 

 



 

Affiliate of the Company on whom a restriction is imposed and (ii) the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 2.06_ shall not apply to any
Registrable Securities that are included in such Underwritten Offering by such
Holder.

 



 

Section 2.07 _Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _Certain Definitions_. " _Registration Expenses_ " shall not include
Selling Expenses but otherwise means all expenses incident to the Companys
performance under or compliance with this Agreement to effect the registration
of Registrable Securities on a Registration Statement pursuant to _Section
2.01_, a Piggyback Registration pursuant to _Section 2.02_, or an
Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.03_, and the disposition of such
Registrable Securities, including all registration, filing, securities
exchange listing and National Securities Exchange fees, all registration,

or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fees of
transfer agents and registrars, all word processing, duplicating and printing
expenses, and the fees and disbursements of counsel and independent public

Registrable Securities, plus any costs or expenses related to any roadshows
conducted in connection with the marketing of any Underwritten Offering.

 



 

(b) _Expenses_. The Company will pay all reasonable Registration Expenses, as
determined in good faith, in connection with a shelf Registration, a Piggyback
Registration or an Underwritten Offering, whether or not any sale is made
pursuant to such shelf Registration, Piggyback Registration or Underwritten
Offering. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata share of all Selling
Expenses in connection with any sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder.
In addition, except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.08_, the Company
shall not be responsible for professional fees (including legal fees) incurred
by Holders in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights hereunder.

 



 

Section 2.08 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _By the Company_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder, its
directors, officers, managers, partners, employees and agents and each Person,
if any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, managers, partners,
employees or agents (collectively, the " _Selling Holder Indemnified Persons_
"), against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), joint
or several, to which such Selling Holder Indemnified Person may become subject
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such
Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact (in the case of any prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made) contained in (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, includes documents incorporated by reference in) the
applicable Registration Statement or other registration statement contemplated
by this Agreement, any preliminary

 



 

EXHIBIT D-13    

 

 



 

prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereof, or any free writing prospectus relating
thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse
each such Selling Holder Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating, defending or
resolving any such Loss or actions or proceedings; _provided, however_ , that
the Company will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any
such Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with
information furnished by such Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing
specifically for use in the applicable Registration Statement or other
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement or final
prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, or any free writing prospectus
relating thereto, as applicable. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling
Holder Indemnified Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities
by such Selling Holder.

 



 

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Companys directors,
officers, employees and agents and each Person, who, directly or indirectly,
controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or of the
Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to
the Selling Holders, but only with respect to information regarding such
Selling Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder
expressly for inclusion in a Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus,
prospectus supplement or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment
or supplement thereto or any free writing prospectus relating thereto;
_provided, however_ , that the liability of each Selling Holder shall not be
greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any Selling
Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the Registrable
Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

 



 

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this _Section
2.08(c),_ except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. In any action brought against any indemnified
party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it
shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and
undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
such indemnified party under this _Section 2.08_ for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with
counsel so selected; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying
party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in any such
action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and
counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the

 



 

EXHIBIT D-14    

 

 



 

indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party
reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying
party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate
counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the
defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate
counsel and other reasonable expenses related to such participation to be
reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no indemnifying party shall settle any action
brought against any indemnified party with respect to which such indemnified
party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the
indemnified party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or
obligation on, includes a complete and unconditional release from liability
of, and does not contain any admission of wrongdoing by, the indemnified
party.

 



 

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section
2.08_ is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless
in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, in
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall any Selling Holder be required to contribute an
aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling
Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable
Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other
hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to,
information supplied by such party, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by
an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first
sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal and other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating, defending or resolving any Loss that is the subject of this
paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 



 

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section 2.08_ shall be
in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 2.09 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the resale of the Registrable Securities without registration, the Company
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

 



 

EXHIBIT D-15    

 

 



 

(a) make and keep public information regarding the Company available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any
similar provision then in effect), at all times from and after the date
hereof;

 



 

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and

 



 

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (i) to the
extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of the Company
that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (or any similar provision then in effect) and (ii) unless
otherwise available via the Commissions EDGAR filing system, to such Holder
forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of
the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may
reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the
Commission allowing such Holder to sell any Registrable Securities without
registration.

 



 

Section 2.10 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Company to register Registrable Securities under this _Article II_
may be transferred or assigned by each Holder to one or more transferees or
assignees of Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) unless
any such transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of, and after such transfer or
assignment continues to be an Affiliate of, such Holder, the amount of
Registrable Securities transferred or assigned to such transferee or assignee
shall represent at least $15 million of Registrable Securities, calculated on
the basis of the Issue Price or such lesser amount if it constitutes the
remaining holdings of the Holder and its Affiliates, (b) the Company is given
written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and
address of each such transferee or assignee and identifying the securities
with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or
assigned and (c) each such transferee or assignee assumes in writing
responsibility for its portion of the obligations of such transferring Holder
under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after
the date hereof, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Holders of at least the Registrable Securities Required Voting Percentage,
enter into any agreement with any current or future holder of any securities
of the Company that would allow such current or future holder to require the
Company to include securities in any registration statement filed by the
Company for Other Holders on a basis other than _pari passu_ with or expressly
subordinate to the piggyback rights of the Holders of Registrable Securities
hereunder; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Company enter into any
agreement that would permit another holder of securities of the Company to
participate on a superior or _pari passu_ basis (in terms of priority of cut-
back based on advice of Underwriters) with a Holder requesting registration or
takedown in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Sale Restrictions_. Each Holder agrees not to publicly or
privately sell, dispose of or distribute any shares of Company Common Stock
(including any shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of
any derivative securities) that are beneficially owned by such Holder, or
issue (publicly or privately) any derivative securities whose value is based
on shares of Company Common Stock, until after the date that is six (6) months
after the

 



 

EXHIBIT D-16    

 

 



 

date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, no Holder
shall have the right to publicly or privately sell, dispose of or distribute
any shares of Company Common Stock (including any shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of any derivative securities), or issue
(publicly or privately) any derivative securities whose value is based on
shares of Company Common Stock, prior to the date that is six (6) months after
the date hereof.

as contemplated by _Section 3.02_, neither this Agreement nor any of the

set forth herein with respect to any and all shares of common stock of the

each such Person, in addition to and without limiting any other remedy or
right it may have, will have the right to seek an injunction or other
equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such
breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and each
of the parties hereto hereby waives any and all defenses it may have on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such an
injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this right will not
preclude any such Person from pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or
in equity that such Person may have.

 



 

Section 3.07 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of

upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement), will be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of
conflicts of laws. Any action against any party relating to the foregoing
shall be brought in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction
located within the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court
located within the State of Delaware over any such action. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a

EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREE AND
CONSENT THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT

therein. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the other agreements and
documents referred to herein or therein supersede all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a
written amendment signed by the Company and the Holders of at least the
Registrable Securities Required Voting Percentage; _provided_ , _however_ ,

hereunder without the consent of such Holder. Any amendment, supplement or
modification of or to any provision of this Agreement, any waiver of any
provision of this Agreement, and any consent to any departure by the Company
or any Holder from the terms of any provision of this Agreement shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent has been made or
given.

forth herein, no Person other than JDH, the Holders, their respective
permitted assignees and the Company shall have any obligation hereunder and
that, notwithstanding that one or more of such Persons may be a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company, no recourse under this Agreement or
under any documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith shall be
had against any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent,
general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any
of such Persons or their respective permitted assignees, or any former,
current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited
partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing,
whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on or otherwise be incurred by any former, current or future director,
officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member,
stockholder or Affiliate of any of such Persons or any of their respective
assignees, or any former, current or future director, officer, employee,
agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate
of any of the foregoing, as such, for any obligations of such Persons or their
respective permitted assignees under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection herewith or for any claim based on, in
respect of or by reason of such obligation or its creation, except, in each
case, for any assignee of JDH or a Selling Holder hereunder.

Schedule to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. All Schedules to this

instruments, documents,

 



 

EXHIBIT D-20    

 

 



 

contracts and agreements as the same may be amended, supplemented and
otherwise modified from time to time, unless otherwise specified. The word
"including" shall mean "including but not limited to" and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. Whenever the Company has an
obligation under this Agreement, the expense of complying with that obligation
shall be an expense of the Company unless otherwise specified. Any reference
in this Agreement to "$" shall mean U.S. dollars. Whenever any determination,
consent or approval is to be made or given by JDH, such action shall be in
such Holders sole discretion, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement.
If any provision in this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, not binding
or unenforceable, (a) such provision shall be fully severable and this
Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, not
binding or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this
Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect,
and (b) the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is not a Business Day, the
period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any words
imparting the singular number only shall include the plural and vice versa.
The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof" and "hereunder" refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words
appear unless the context otherwise requires. The provision of a Table of

EXHIBIT E-1    

 

 



 

vote in favor of such Seller Designees election) for so long as JDH continues
to satisfy the Minimum Holding Threshold (as defined below). For purposes of
this Agreement, the " _Designation Right Termination Date_ " shall be the date
on which JDH or its successors (together with all Affiliates of such Person)
ceases to hold on an aggregate basis at least 7.5% of the then-issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Minimum Holding Threshold_
"). The initial Seller Designee designated pursuant to this _Section 1(a)_ as
of the Closing Date (and who shall be appointed by the Company to the Board as
of the Closing Date) is Jeffery D. Hildebrand (the " _Initial Seller Designee_
"), subject to and conditioned upon the Initial Seller Designees execution of
a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Annex A_ (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), dated as of the Closing
Date. JDH may elect, at its sole discretion, to designate a new individual to
serve as the Seller Designee at any time by written notice to the Company;
_provided_ , that such Person has executed the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Removal of Designee_. Directors of the Company are subject to removal
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the organizational documents of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , for as long as this Agreement remains in
effect, subject to applicable law, the Seller Designee or any Replacement
Designee may only be removed or required to resign with the consent of JDH.
JDH may remove or cause the Seller Designee to resign from the Board at any
time, with or without cause.

 



 

(c) _Vacancies; Replacement Designee_. Prior to the Designation Right
Termination Date, any vacancy created by the death, resignation or removal of
the Seller Designee shall, upon receipt of written instructions from JDH (or
such successors or Affiliates holding the Minimum Holding Threshold)
identifying a replacement designee who satisfies the requirements of a Seller
Designee set forth in _Section 2_ (the " _Replacement Designee_ "), be filled
by the Board pursuant to such instructions within three business days of
receipt of such instructions. Prior to the Designation Right Termination Date,
such Replacement Designee shall serve until the Companys next ensuing annual
meeting of stockholders and, at such meeting and each subsequent annual
meeting of stockholders of the Company, shall be included on the slate of
nominees for election to the Board and recommended by the Board in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. The resignation by any Seller Designee shall
not be effective until JDH shall have designated a Replacement Designee
pursuant to this _Section 1(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, any Seller
Designee that ceases to be a member of the Board (whether by removal,
retirement or otherwise) can only be replaced by JDH pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if JDH fails to designate a
Replacement Designee within 30 days of any vacancy of the Seller Designee, the
Company may appoint an interim successor director until JDH makes such
designation.

 



 

(d) _D andO Insurance_. At all times Seller Designees and Replacement Designees
(i) while serving as a member of the Board, shall be entitled to coverage
under any "directors and officers" liability insurance maintained by the
Company (or any Person on behalf of the Company) and (ii) shall be entitled to
all other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation,
in each case, as are then made available to any other present or former member
of the Board (in such capacity). For clarity, no adverse amendment to such
rights will be effective as to a Seller Designee or Replacement Designee on a
go forward basis without such Seller Designee or Replacement Designees
written consent.

 



 

EXHIBIT E-2    

 

 



 

(e) _Business Opportunities_. Without limiting the effect of this Agreement or
the Purchase Agreement, from and after the the date hereof, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries (including ASLP), renounces any interest or expectancy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to
participate in, any business opportunities that are from time to time
presented to JDH or any of its Affiliates (whether present or future) or any
of their respective Representatives, Affiliates or Subsidiaries, including any
director (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Seller Designee or
Replacement Designee) of the Company who is also an Affiliate or Subsidiary of
JDH or a Representative of such an Affiliate or Subsidiary of JDH (each, a "
_Specified Party_ "), even if the business opportunity is one that the Company
or its Subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the
ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no
Specified Party shall have any duty to communicate or offer any such business
opportunity to the Company or be liable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any equityholder, including for breach of any fiduciary or
other duty, as a director, or equityholder or otherwise, unless, in the case
of a Person who is a director (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Seller Designee or Replacement Designee) of the Company, such business
opportunity is offered to such director in his or her capacity as a director
of the Company. The Company has taken and agrees to take such action
(including through the Board) as is necessary to give full effect to the
renunciation contemplated by this _Section 1(e)_.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Designation Rights_. Upon the Designation Right
Termination Date, the right of JDH (or such successors or Affiliates holding
the Minimum Holding Threshold) to designate a Seller Designee shall terminate
and, if requested in writing by the Board, the Seller Designee then serving on
the Board, promptly shall resign as a member of the Board. If the Seller
Designee does not resign upon such request, then a majority of the other
directors then serving on the Board may remove the Seller Designee as a member
of the Board.

 



 

(g) _Conflicts of Interest; Recusal; No Compensation_. Notwithstanding any
rights to be granted or provided to a Seller Designee hereunder, the Board may
exclude the Seller Designee from access to any Board or Committee materials or
information or meeting or portion thereof or written consent if the Board
determines, in good faith (after reasonable consultation with the Seller
Designee regarding the reasons therefor), that including the Seller Designee
in discussions relating to such determination or providing the Seller Designee
with such access would reasonably be expected to result in a conflict of
interest with the Company; _provided_ , that (i) such exclusion shall be
limited to the portion of the Board or Committee material or information
and/or meeting or written consent that is the basis for such exclusion and
shall not extend to any portion of the Board or Committee material and/or
meeting that does not involve or pertain to such exclusion and (ii) the Seller
Designee shall be given reasonable prior written notice of such exclusion (or,
if prior notice is not practicable, as promptly as practical thereafter). The
matters set forth on _Annex B_ hereto shall be deemed to involve a conflict of
interest with the Company (it being understood that _Annex B_ has been
provided for illustrative purposes and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
exclusion of a matter from _Annex B_ shall not be deemed an indication or
determination that such matter does not involve a conflict of interest).
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this clause (g), a Seller Designee
shall receive the same information provided to other members of the Board, at
the same time as such information is provided to other members of the Board
and including monthly information packages, shall be provided with reasonable
access to management and shall be

 



 

EXHIBIT E-3    

 

 



 

entitled to receive customary reimbursement of fees and expenses incurred in
connection with his or her service as a member of the Board and/or any
Committee thereof consistent with the Companys policies applicable to the
other members of the Board. A Seller Designee shall not be entitled to
compensation from the Company, including compensation paid to other directors
of the Company in the ordinary course.

 



 

Section 2. _Director Qualifications_. Any Seller Designee shall be required to
have the following qualifications, as determined in the reasonable judgment of
a majority of the other members of the Board: (a) such Seller Designee shall
be required to have the requisite skill and experience to serve as a director
of a public company and (b) such Seller Designee shall not have been
prohibited from serving as a director pursuant to any rule or regulation of
the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange on
which shares of the Company Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading.
JDH agrees (x) upon the Companys request to timely provide the Company with
accurate and complete information relating to any Seller Designee as may be
required to be disclosed by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), or the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and (y) to cause such Seller Designee to comply with the Section 16
obligations under the Exchange Act. Any Seller Designee shall be required to
agree to and be bound by any policies or procedures of the Board that are
applicable to other non-employee directors, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Companys insider trading policy, corporate governance guidelines
and code of business conduct.

 



 

Section 3. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement is intended by the Parties as a final

agreements and understandings between the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

 



 

(b) _Notices_. All notices and demands provided for in this Agreement shall be

part of this Agreement, and the remaining

 



 

EXHIBIT E-4    

 

 



 

provisions shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) the Parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. When calculating the
period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be

succeeding Business Day. Any words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter,"
"hereof" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to

and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and shall
not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and all
claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based

irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court located within the State of Delaware over any such action. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

(e) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION (i) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (ii) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE

EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS

RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

EXHIBIT E-5    

 

 



 

(f) _No Waiver; Modifications in Writing_.

 



 

(i) _Delay_. No failure or delay on the part of any Party in exercising any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any remedies that may be available to a Party at law or in equity or
otherwise.

 



 

(ii) _Specific Waiver_. Except as otherwise provided herein, no amendment,
waiver, consent, modification or termination of any provision of this
Agreement shall be effective unless signed by each of the Parties hereto
affected by such amendment, waiver, consent, modification or termination. Any
amendment, supplement or modification of or to any provision of this
Agreement, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement and any consent to
any departure by a Party from the terms of any provision of this Agreement
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which made or given. Except where notice is specifically required by this
Agreement, no notice to or demand on a Party in any case shall entitle such
Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances. Any investigation by or on behalf of any Party shall not be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein.

 



 

(g) _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different Parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be

signature pages by facsimile or electronic transmission constitutes effective

lieu of the original Agreement. Signatures of the Parties transmitted by
facsimile or electronic transmission will be deemed to be their original
signatures for any purpose whatsoever.

 



 

(h) _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, but will not be assignable or delegable by any Party hereto
without the prior written consent of each of the other Parties.

 



 

(i) _Independent Counsel_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that it has been
represented by independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations
that have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed
the same with consent and upon the advice of said independent counsel. Each
Party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this
Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts
relating thereto will be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not be

rule of Law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against the Party that drafted it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived.

 



 

(j) _Specific Enforcement_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
monetary damages would not adequately compensate an injured Party for the
breach of this Agreement by any Party, that this Agreement shall be
specifically enforceable and that any breach or threatened

 



 

EXHIBIT E-6    

 

 



 

breach of this Agreement shall be the proper subject of a temporary or
permanent injunction or restraining order without a requirement of posting
bond. Further, each Party hereto waives any claim or defense that there is an
adequate remedy at law for such breach or threatened breach.

 **ANNEX A**

 



 

 ** _Form of Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement_**

 



 

This Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is
made this [] 2019, by and between Archrock, Inc. (the " _Company_ ") and
(the " _Recipient")_. The Company and the Recipient are sometimes referred to
herein individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_."

 



 

WHEREAS, the Recipient is a member of the Board of Directors (" _Board_ ") of
the Company or a person who may be granted by the Board, from time to time,
the opportunity to attend meetings of the Board and to receive materials
delivered to members of the Board;

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with such activities, the Recipient may receive certain
information considered to be proprietary or confidential by the Company; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to maintain the confidentiality of information
provided by the Company to the Recipient and to provide a procedure designed
to protect such proprietary or confidential information from unauthorized use
and disclosure.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

1. The term " _Information_ ," as used in this Agreement, shall mean any and all non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information furnished or disclosed, on or after the date hereof, to the Recipient by the Company or on the Companys behalf, whether such information is written, oral or graphic, and whether included in any analyses, compilations, studies, reports, or other documents or presentations, including but not limited to, financial plans and records, marketing plans, business strategies and relationships with third parties, present and proposed products, trade secrets, information regarding customers and suppliers, strategic planning and systems, and contractual terms.

 



 

2. Except to the extent set forth in a written consent to disclosure of Information from the Board, the Recipient shall consider the Information received from the Company confidential and proprietary, shall take all reasonable actions to protect and maintain the confidentiality of such Information and protect such Information from disclosure in any form whatsoever. Such actions shall include, without limitation, not discussing the Information with any present or past stockholder or employee of the Company who is not subject to an agreement with the Company in the same form as this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Board; provided, however, that the parties agree that, so long as the Recipient is a member of the Board, he or she shall be entitled to discuss Information with present employees of the Company in the exercise of her or his duties as a member of the Board.

 



 

3. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Recipient may disclose the Information received from the Company with the individuals listed on

 



     

 

 



 

 _Schedule A_ hereto.(1)

 



 

4. Following receipt of a written request from the Board, the Recipient shall deliver to the Company or destroy (at the Recipients option) any copies of the Information in the Recipients possession, and the Recipient shall certify in writing to its compliance with this Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Recipient may retain copies of the Information for reasonable legal or regulatory purposes.

 



 

5. The Parties agree that no failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof.

 



 

6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the term "Information" shall not include any information that:

 



 

a. is or becomes generally known or available to the public through no breach
hereof by the Recipient;

 



 

b. was lawfully obtained by the Recipient other than in her or his capacity as
a member of the Board;

 



 

c. was independently developed by or for the Recipient, or acquired by the
Recipient, without any use of or reference to such Information; or

 



 

d. was obtained from, or available to the Recipient by, a third party which,
to the Recipients knowledge, was not bound by any confidentiality obligation
to Company which would prohibit such third party from disclosing such
information to the Recipient.

 



 

7. In the event that the Recipient is compelled, requested or required (orally or in writing) by a regulatory authority, law, regulation, oral questions, requests for information or documents, interrogatories, subpoena, court order, deposition, administrative proceeding, inspection, audit, civil investigative demand, formal or informal investigation by any government authority or agency or other similar legal process to disclose any Information, the Recipient shall provide to the Company in writing prompt notice (if legally permissible and practicable) of any such request or requirement so that the Company may, at its own cost, intervene and seek an appropriate protective order or waive certain of the Recipients obligations under this Agreement. Failing the entry of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, if the Recipient, on the advice of its counsel, is required or compelled to disclose Information, the Parties agree that the Recipient may disclose that portion of Information that, on the advice of the Recipients counsel, the Recipient is required or compelled to disclose. In any event, the Recipient shall reasonably cooperate with the Company, at the Companys own cost, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Information.

  (1) Schedule A to include the designees counsel and officers, employees and
professional advisors of JDH Capital (including legal, tax and accounting
advisors and Jason Rebrook).

 



     

 

 



 

8. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to any obligation which the Parties have to protect Information disclosed to them, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings in connection therewith. This Agreement may be amended, waived, revoked or terminated only by a written agreement signed by both Parties which makes specific reference to this Agreement.

 



 

9. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Company may be irreparably damaged by any breach of this Agreement. In addition to the rights and remedies otherwise available at law or in equity, the Parties agree that the Company shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including an injunction or specific performance, in the event of any breach of this Agreement by the Recipient. Further, in the event that the Board determines that the Recipient has breached this Agreement, at the request of the Board, the Recipient shall tender his or her resignation from the Board.

 



 

10. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original hereof and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same document. The provisions of this Agreement shall be in addition to, and shall not in any way reduce or modify, the duties of any member of the Board with respect to the matters contained herein under the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or under applicable Delaware fiduciary or other law.

 



 

11. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law principles.

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as
of the date first written above.
