sale of Hydrocarbons produced from or allocable to the Assets during the
Interim Period, net of Third Party expenses (other than Operating Expenses)
directly incurred in earning or receiving such proceeds and for which no
adjustment pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ is made, and any sales, excise or
similar taxes in connection therewith not reimbursed to Seller by a Third
Party purchaser;

 

(ii) an amount equal to all other proceeds received by Seller (other than from
the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from or allocable to the Assets) to which
Buyer is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3_ ;

(iii) an amount equal to all amounts received by Seller as (A) overhead
payments from Third Parties, (B) handling, processing and transportation fees,
(C) platform rental payments and (D) other payments from Third Parties related
to ownership of the Assets, in each case attributable to time periods after
the Effective Time;

(iv) an amount determined pursuant to _Section 13.3(c)_ for any Properties
and other Assets excluded from the Assets pursuant to such Section;

(v) without duplication of any other amounts set forth in this _Section 3.3_ ,
the amount of all taxes prorated to Seller but payable by Buyer in accordance
with _Section 16.2_ ;

 

(vi) to the extent that Seller is overproduced as of the Effective Time in an
aggregate amount greater (or underproduced in a lesser amount) than the net
Imbalances for gas as set forth in _Schedule 3.3_ , as complete and final
settlement

 



16  of all such Imbalances, an amount based on a rate mutually agreeable to
Buyer and Seller, or otherwise, the natural gas NYMEX Strip;

 

(vii) to the extent that Seller is overproduced as of the Effective Time in an
aggregate amount greater (or underproduced in a lesser amount) than the net
Imbalances for oil as set forth in _Schedule 3.3_ , as complete and final
settlement of all such Imbalances, an amount based on a rate mutually
agreeable to Buyer and Seller, or otherwise, the oil NYMEX Strip; 

(viii) all Title Defect Amounts as determined pursuant to _Section 4.2_ and
Environmental Defect Amounts as determined pursuant to _Section 4.3_; and

(ix) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon by Seller and Buyer.

Buyer and Seller agree that neither party shall be charged interest on the
Break-Up Fee or the Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller agree that any
adjustments related to _Section 3.3(a)(iii)_ and _(iv)_ and _Section
3.3(b)(vi)_ and _(vii)_ shall be handled on the Final Settlement
Statement and not on the Preliminary Settlement Statement or after the
payment of the final adjustment pursuant to _Section 3.6_. It is intended that
adjustments pursuant to such Sections are to be based on the net variance from
the amount of underproduction or overproduction shown on _Schedule 3.3_ , as
the volumes shown on such schedule are understood to have been accounted for
in the Purchase Price. The rate for adjustment for Imbalance variances from
the amount shown on  _Schedule 3.3_ is intended to be a reasonable amount
(based on such factors as the time period that the Imbalance was accrued, the
time period allowed for repayment and the historical or projected price for
the product during the time period in question) for those Imbalances
discovered and raised by either party within the time frames set forth in
_Section 3.6_.

 

3.4 _Adjustment Methodology_. When available, actual figures will be used for
the adjustments to the Purchase Price at the Closing. To the extent actual
figures are not available, estimates will be used subject to final adjustments
in accordance with _Section 3.6_.

3.5 _Preliminary Settlement Statement_. Not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review a
draft settlement statement (the " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ ") that
shall set forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment made
in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of preparation of such
Preliminary Settlement Statement and the calculation of the adjustments used
to determine such amount, together with the designation of Sellers account
for the wire transfer of funds as set forth in _Section 11.3(c)_. The
estimated Adjusted Purchase Price delivered in accordance with this _Section
3.5_ less the Break-Up Fee shall constitute the dollar amount to be paid by
Buyer to Seller at the Closing.

3.6 _Final Settlement Statement_.

(a) On or before 150 days after the Closing, a final settlement statement
(the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") will be prepared by Seller, based on
actual income and expenses during the Interim Period and which takes into
account all final adjustments

 



17  made to the Purchase Price and shows the resulting final Purchase Price ("
_Final Price_ "). The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual
proration of the amounts required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable,
and in any event within 60 days, after receipt of the Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer shall either agree in writing with the Final Settlement
Statement or return a written report containing any proposed changes to the
Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the
reasons therefor (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). If the Final Price set forth in
the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer,
the net unpaid amount of the Final Price shall be paid according thereto. For
the avoidance of doubt, any payment owing under this _Section 3.6_ shall not
be subject to the Indemnification Deductible or the Indemnification Cap
contained in _Section 14.5_. Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as
paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final
Price shall be paid by the owing party without interest within ten (10)
days of (i) the Final Settlement Statement or (ii) if the Final Price is
disputed, resolution of the Final Price, to the owed party.

(b) If Seller fails to prepare the Final Settlement Statement within such
150-day period, it shall pay to Buyer interest at the rate of 8% per annum
from the 151st day after the Closing (the " _Specified Date_ ") until
preparation of such Final Settlement Statement on the net amount, if any,
found to be owing to Buyer as shown on such Final Settlement Statement.

 

(c) If Buyer fails to either agree with the Final Settlement Statement or
return a Dispute Notice within 60 days of its receipt of the Final Settlement
Statement, it shall pay to Seller interest at the rate of 8% per annum from
the Specified Date on the net amount, if any, found to be owing to Seller as
shown on such Final Settlement Statement and shall be deemed to have agreed
with the Final Settlement Statement.

3.7 _Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters
addressed in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Seller shall within 60 days
after the delivery of a timely Dispute Notice in accordance with _Section
3.6(a)_ , summarize its position with regard to such dispute in a written
document of twenty pages or less and submit such summaries to such person as
the parties may mutually select (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "), together
with this Agreement, the Dispute Notice, the Preliminary
Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement and any other
documentation such party may desire to submit. Within 30 Business Days after
receiving the parties respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall
render a decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with
respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials
described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant
hereto shall include a written statement as to the basis for such decision
and shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and will be
enforceable against any of the parties in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Seller shall bear one-half and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs of the
Accounting Arbitrator, and each of Seller and Buyer shall bear its own legal
fees and other costs in presenting its case.

3.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price / Allocated Values_. Buyer and Seller agree
that the unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Assets as set
forth in _Schedule 3.8_ of this Agreement. The " _Allocated Value_ " for any
Asset equals the portion of the unadjusted

 



18  Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on _Schedule 3.8_ and such Allocated
Value shall be used in calculating adjustments to the Purchase Price as
provided herein. Seller and Buyer agree and stipulate that (i) the Allocated
Value shall be used by Seller and Buyer as the basis for reporting asset
values and other items for purposes of all applicable tax returns and (ii)
neither they nor their Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with the
Allocated Value in notices to Governmental Authorities, in audit or other
proceedings with respect to taxes, in notices to Preference Right holders, or
in other documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

4.1 _Seller s Title_. For the sole purpose of determining Title Defects,
Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that Buyers title to the Properties
as shown on _Exhibit B_ , as of the Closing Date, is Defensible Title. The
representation and warranty in this  _Section 4.1_ shall terminate as of the
Title Claim Date and shall have no further force and effect thereafter;
_provided_ that there shall be no termination of Buyers or Sellers rights or
obligations under  _Section 3.2_ with respect to any bona fide Title Defect
or Title Benefit claim properly reported on or before the Title Claim Date.
The termination of the representation and warranty in this _Section 4.1_
shall not in any manner affect or diminish the special warranty of title
provided in the Assignments, except to the extent, in order to avoid
duplication, that any Title Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to this _Article
IV_ (i) has been cured by Seller as of Closing or (ii) is the subject of a
finally resolved Purchase Price adjustment hereunder.

4.2 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_.

(a) To assert a claim arising out of a breach of _Section 4.1_, Buyer must
deliver a claim notice to Seller (each a " _Title Defect Notice_ ") on or
before the date which is fifteen (15) Business Days subsequent to the date
hereof (the " _Title Claim Date_ "). Such notice shall be in writing and
shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s) that is
reasonably sufficient for Seller to determine the basis of the alleged Title
Defect(s), (ii) the Properties adversely affected by the alleged Title
Defect(s), (iii) the Allocated Values of the Properties subject to the alleged
Title Defect(s), (iv) all documents upon which Buyer relies for its assertion
of the alleged Title Defect(s), including, at a minimum, supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner
hired by Seller or its Affiliates) to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Defect(s) and (v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the
Allocated Values of those Properties are reduced by the alleged Title
Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Buyers belief is
based, including any analysis by any title attorney or examiner hired by
Buyer. Except in the event of fraud on the part of Seller, Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived all breaches of _Section 4.1_ of which Seller has not
been given notice on or before the Title Claim Date; _provided_ that such
waiver shall not in any manner affect or diminish Buyers rights and remedies
with respect to the special warranty of title provided in the Assignments,
except to the extent, in order to avoid duplication, that any Title Defect
asserted pursuant to this _Article IV_ (i) has been cured by Seller as of
Closing or (ii) is the subject of a finally resolved Purchase Price adjustment
hereunder. Buyer shall not be entitled to protection under the special

 



19  warranty of title set forth in the Assignments against any Title Defect for
which a Title Defect Notice is furnished pursuant to this _Section 4.2(a)_ or
any Title Defect disclosed in writing to Seller by Buyer prior to the Title
Claim Date.

(b) Should Buyer discover any Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim
Date, Buyer shall as soon as practicable, but in any case by the Title Claim
Date, deliver to Seller a notice including (i) a description of the Title
Benefit that is reasonably sufficient to determine the basis of the alleged
Title Benefit, (ii) the Properties affected by the alleged Title Benefit,
(iii) the Allocated Values of the Properties subject to such alleged Title
Benefit, (iv) all documents upon which Buyer relies for its assertion of
the alleged Title Benefit and (v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of those Properties is increased by the alleged
Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon which Buyers belief
is based, including any analysis by any title attorney or examiner hired by
Buyer. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Buyer a similar notice on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each
Title Benefit discovered by Seller. Except in the event of fraud on the part
of Buyer, Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which
neither Buyer nor Seller has given notice on or before the Title Claim Date.

 

(c) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, to cure or remove on or before the Closing Date any
alleged Title Defects for which Seller has received a Title Defect Notice from
Buyer prior to the Title Claim Date. If any such Title Defect is not cured by
the Closing Date, Seller shall remedy such Title Defect pursuant to _Section
4.2(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, as of the date five (5) Business
Days prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer cannot agree on (i) the proper and
adequate cure for any such Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect Amount or
(iii) whether the alleged Title Defect constitutes a Title Defect, such
dispute(s) shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 4.2(i)_. An election by Seller to attempt to cure a
Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under _Section 4.2(i)_
and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers
right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the
alleged Title Defect.

(d) In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Buyer or, subject to
_Section 4.2(c)_, cured prior to the Closing, Seller may, at its sole
election, and subject to the Individual Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Defect Deductible, elect to (i) make a downward adjustment to the Purchase
Price equal to an amount determined (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ") pursuant
to _Section 4.2(g)_ as being the value of such Title Defect or (ii) retain
the entirety of the defected Property that is adversely affected by
such Title Defect, in which event the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward, by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such defected Property
and such defected Property shall no longer be included within the definition
of Assets for any purpose under this Agreement.

(e) With respect to each Property affected by Title Benefits reported under
_ Section 4.2(b)_, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the
_"Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for
such affected Property, as determined pursuant to  _Section 4.2(h)_.

 



20 (f) _Section 4.2(d)_ shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Sellers
breach of its warranty and representation in _Section 4.1_. In this regard
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a
Title Defect under this _Article IV_ results from any matter which could also
result in the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller as set forth
in this Agreement (other than _Article IV_ ), then Buyer shall only be
entitled to assert such matter prior to the Title Claim Date as a Title
Defect to the extent permitted by this _Article IV_ and shall be precluded
from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any such
representation or warranty.

 

(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be
the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from Sellers
interest in the affected Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Well and (B) the Net Revenue Interest or percentage stated on
_Exhibit B_ , then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Well multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the Net Revenue Interest or percentage ownership decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest or percentage ownership
stated on _Exhibit B_ ; _provided_ that if the Title Defect does not affect
the Well throughout its entire productive life, then the Title Defect Amount
determined under this _Section 4.2(g)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take into
account the applicable time period only;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Property of a type not
described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Property so affected, the portion of the Lease or Well affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the affected Lease or Well, the values
placed on the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and such other factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation;

(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article IV_ , the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects on any given Lease or Well shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Lease or Well;

 



21 (vi) if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, then
the Title Defect Amount determined under subsections (iii) or (iv) above
shall not be greater than the amount that can reasonably be shown to be the
reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect; and

 

(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise receives credit in
the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price.

(h) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit B_ ; _provided_ that
if the Title Benefit does not pertain to the Lease or Well throughout its
entire productive life, then the Title Benefit Amount determined under this
_Section 4.2(h)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time
period only.

(i) Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects and Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts by five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If Seller and Buyer are unable to
agree by that date, Sellers estimate shall be used to determine the Adjusted
Purchase Price to be paid at Closing, and the Title Defect and Title Defect
Amounts, Title Benefit and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute, and only such
disputes, shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to
this _Section 4.2(i)_. During the 10-day period following the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall submit any Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts and
any Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute to a title attorney
with at least 15 years of experience in oil and gas titles in the State of
Texas as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller, or absent such
agreement during the 10-day period, by the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section. The Title Arbitrators determination shall be made within 45 days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding
upon the parties hereto, without right of appeal. In making his determination,
the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in _Section
4.2(g)_ and _Section 4.2(h)_ and may consider such other matters as in the
opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage
disinterested Third Parties, including title attorneys from other states and
petroleum engineers, to advise the Title Arbitrator, but shall disclose to the
Parties the identities of such consultants. Any such consultant shall not have
worked as an employee or consultant for any party hereto or its Affiliates
during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration nor have any
financial interest in the dispute. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert
for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect and
Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by
Buyer or Seller and may not award damages, interest or penalties with respect
to any matter. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other,

 



22  each shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.
Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator,
and Seller shall be responsible for the remaining one-half of such costs and
expenses.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
available in respect of Title Defects or Title Benefits, as applicable:

(i) With respect to Title Defects, (A) for any Title Defect Amount with
respect to an individual Title Defect Property, if such amount does not exceed
$50,000 (each, an " _Individual Defect Threshold_ "); and (B) unless the
amount of all such Title Defect Amounts ( _provided_ that each such Title
Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold), in the aggregate
(excluding any Title Defect Amounts with respect to Title Defects cured by
Seller in accordance with this _Article IV_ ) exceeds three quarters of one
percent (0.75%) of the Purchase Price (adjusted for any Preference Rights
Assets, in an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Preference Rights
Assets less any purchase price adjustments agreed to between Seller and Third
Party with respect to the sale of such Preference Rights Assets, excluded from
this transaction pursuant to _Section 13.3(c)_) (the " _Aggregate Defect
Deductible_ "), after which point, subject to the Individual Defect Threshold,
Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
elected by Seller in accordance with _Section 4.2(d)_ only with respect to
Title Defect Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible and only to
the extent that Title Defect Amounts exceed the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 

(ii) With respect to Title Benefits, (A) for any Title Benefit Amount with
respect to an individual Title Benefit Property, if such amount does not
exceed $50,000 (each, an " _Individual Benefit Threshold_ "); and (B) unless
the aggregate amount of all such Title Benefit Amounts ( _provided_ that each
such Title Benefit Amount exceeds the Individual Benefit Threshold), in the
aggregate exceeds three quarters of one percent (0.75%) of the Purchase Price
(adjusted for any Preference Rights Assets, in an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Preference Rights Assets less any purchase price
adjustments agreed to between Seller and Third Party with respect to the sale
of such Preference Rights Assets, excluded from this transaction pursuant to
_Section 13.3(c)_) (the " _Aggregate Benefit Deductible_ "), after which
point, subject to the Individual Benefit Threshold, Seller shall be entitled
to adjustments to the Purchase Price only with respect to Title Benefit
Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Benefit Deductible and only to the extent
that Title Benefit Amounts exceed the Aggregate Benefit Deductible.

4.3 _Environmental Matters._  

(a) Seller shall provide Buyer, at Buyers sole cost, risk and expense, with
access during the regular business hours of Seller to all material
information in Sellers possession or control pertaining to the environmental
condition of the Properties, including any environmental reports, permits,
Records and assessments, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
make available to Buyer those personnel and representatives of Seller who
would reasonably be expected to have material knowledge or material
information regarding the environmental status or condition of
the Properties,

 



23  but only to the extent that Seller may do so without violating any
obligations to any Third Party and to the extent that Seller has the authority
to grant such access without breaching any restriction binding on it.

(b) Buyer may, or may engage a qualified environmental contractor to, conduct
a non-invasive on-site inspection, environmental assessment, and compliance
audit of the Properties (an " _Environmental Assessment_ ") at Buyers sole
risk, liability, and expense; _provided_ that: (i) Buyer shall provide Seller
with prior written notice of any activities with respect to any such
Environmental Assessment, and shall provide Seller the opportunity to
participate in all such activities; (ii) any contractor engaged to perform all
or any portion of such Environmental Assessment shall execute and deliver to
Seller a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller;
(iii) Buyer shall not conduct, authorize, or permit any test drilling,
sampling, or other on-site activities without prior written notice to Seller
and the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; (iv) if requested by Seller, Buyer shall
provide to Seller promptly (and in any event, within three (3) Business Days)
after receipt, at no cost to Seller, all draft and final reports, results,
data, analyses of site visits, remediation cost estimates, and any other
portion of such Environmental Assessment, all of which shall be subject to
the confidentiality provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement and any
applicable privacy Laws regarding personal information; and (v) Buyer agrees
to abide by Sellers, and any Third Party operators, safety rules,
regulations, and operating policies while conducting its due diligence
evaluation of the Assets. Notwithstanding this _Section 4.3(b)_, Buyer shall
not be entitled to conduct a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment. Buyer
shall obtain, and during the period of such inspection or testing of the
Properties shall maintain, at its expense, commercial general liability
insurance, including a contractual liability endorsement, property damage
liability coverage and personal injury liability coverage, with Seller and
its managing agent, if any, as additional insureds, from an insurer reasonably
acceptable to Seller, which insurance policies must have limits for bodily
injury and death of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) for any
one occurrence and not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) for
property damage liability for any one occurrence, and shall provide for 30
days prior notice to Seller in event of cancellation or modification of
policy or reduction in coverage. Buyer shall maintain any insurance policies
obtained pursuant to this _Section 4.3(b)_ for 3 years following Buyers due
diligence investigation. Prior to making any entry upon the Properties,
Buyer shall furnish to Seller a certificate of insurance evidencing the
foregoing coverages.

(c) Buyer shall coordinate its access rights to the Assets granted under this
_Section 4.3_ with Seller to reasonably minimize any inconvenience to or
interruption of the conduct of business by Seller. Buyer shall provide Seller
with at least seventy-two (72) hours written notice before the Assets are
accessed pursuant to this _Section 4.3_, along with a description of the
activities Buyer intends to undertake.

 

(d) In connection with the rights of access, examination and inspection
granted to Buyer under this  _Section 4.3_, (i) BUYER WAIVES AND RELEASES
ALL CLAIMS AGAINST THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES ARISING IN ANY WAY THEREFROM
OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED THEREWITH AND (ii)

 



24  BUYER HEREBY AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH OF THE
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES AND THIRD PARTY OPERATORS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND
ALL DAMAGES, CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, ACTIONS, LOSSES, COSTS AND EXPENSES
ATTRIBUTABLE TO PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH OR PHYSICAL PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR
VIOLATION OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTYS OR ANY THIRD PARTY OPERATORS
RULES, REGULATIONS, OR OPERATING POLICIES, ARISING OUT OF, RESULTING FROM OR
RELATING TO ANY FIELD VISIT, ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OR OTHER DUE DILIGENCE
ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY BUYER WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS, EVEN IF SUCH
LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW BY ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR THIRD PARTY
OPERATORS.

(e) To assert an Environmental Defect, Buyer must deliver a claim notice to
Seller (each an " _Environmental Defect Notice_ ") on or before the date which
is fifteen (15) Business Days subsequent to the date hereof (the "
_Environmental Claim Date_ "). Such notice shall be in writing and shall
include (i) a description of the alleged Environmental Defect(s) that is
reasonably sufficient for Seller to determine the basis of the alleged
Environmental Defect(s), (ii) the Properties adversely affected by the alleged
Environmental Defect(s), (iii) the Allocated Values of Properties subject to
the alleged Environmental Defect(s), (iv) all documents upon which Buyer
relies for its assertion of the alleged Environmental Defect(s), including, at
a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as
any environmental attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the
existence of the alleged Environmental Defect(s) and (v) the estimated cost to
cure or investigate such alleged Environmental Defect(s) and the computations
and information upon which Buyers belief is based, including any analysis,
recommendations or proposals provided by any environmental contractor hired by
Buyer. Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all claims for Environmental
Defects of which Seller has not been given notice on or before
the Environmental Claim Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the waiver in the
foregoing sentence shall not apply to, nor in any way diminish Buyers rights
and remedies with respect to a breach of the representation and warranty in 
_Section 5.14_.

(f) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt,
at Sellers sole cost, to cure or remediate on or before the Closing Date any
alleged Environmental Defects for which Seller has received an Environmental
Defect Notice from Buyer prior to the Environmental Claim Date. If any such
Environmental Defect is not cured by the Closing Date, Seller shall remedy
such Environmental Defect; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, as of the date
five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer cannot agree on (i)
the proper and adequate cure for any such Environmental Defect, (ii) the
Environmental Defect Amount or (iii) whether the alleged Environmental Defect
constitutes an Environmental Defect, such dispute(s) shall be finally and
exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section 4.3(j)_.
An election by Seller to attempt to cure an Environmental Defect shall be
without prejudice to its rights under

 



25   _Section 4.3(j)_ and shall not constitute an admission against interest or
a waiver of Sellers right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or
cost to cure, the alleged Environmental Defect.

(g) In the event that any Environmental Defect is not waived by Buyer or,
subject to  _Section 4.3(f)_, cured prior to the Closing, Seller shall, at
its sole election, and subject to the Individual Environmental Defect
Threshold and the Aggregate Environmental Defect Deductible, elect to (i) make
a downward adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to an amount determined
pursuant to _Section 4.3(i)_ as being the value of such Environmental Defect
(the " _Environmental Defect Amount_ ") or (ii) retain the entirety of the
defected Property that is adversely affected by such Environmental Defect, in
which event, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward, by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such defected Property and such defected Property
shall no longer be included within the definition of Assets for any purpose
under this Agreement.

(h) _Section 4.3(e)_ shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Defects.

(i) The Environmental Defect Amount resulting from an Environmental Defect
shall be determined as follows:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Environmental Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Environmental Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Environmental Defect is not agreed upon pursuant to subsection (i)
above, the Environmental Defect Amount shall be determined assuming use of
(A) all available institutional and engineering controls the use of which do
not materially impair use by Buyer of the relevant Property involved for its
intended purposes, (B) to the extent risk-based remediation standards are
applicable, the least restrictive standard that can be applied which does not
materially impair use by Buyer of the relevant Property involved for its
intended purposes, and (C) such means and methods as will result in the
lowest cost for the required remediation under applicable Environmental Laws,
which means and methods do not materially impair use by Buyer of the relevant
Property for its intended purposes; and

 

(iii) the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an Environmental Defect
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Environmental Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise
receives credit in the calculation of the Purchase Price.

 

(j) Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Environmental Defects and
Environmental Defect Amounts by not later than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by that date,
Sellers estimate shall be used to determine the Adjusted Purchase Price to be
paid at Closing, and the Environmental Defect Amounts in dispute , and only
such disputes, shall be exclusively

 



26  and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this _Section 4.3(j)_.
During the 10-day period following the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall submit
any Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts in dispute to an
environmental consultant with at least 15 years of experience in oil and gas
related environmental matters in the State of Texas as selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller, or absent such agreement during the 10-day
period, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association (the "
_Environmental Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Environmental
Arbitrators determination shall be made within 45 days after submission of
the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on both Parties, without
right of appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator
shall be bound by the provisions set forth in this _Section 4.3_
and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the
opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a
proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award
Buyer more than the remediation amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable
Environmental Defect Notice. Additionally, the Environmental Arbitrator may
consult with and engage disinterested Third Parties to advise the arbitrator,
including environmental attorneys from other states and petroleum engineers.
The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Environmental Defect Amounts submitted and
may not award damages, interest or penalties with respect to any matter.
Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of
the Environmental Arbitrator, and Seller shall be responsible for the
remaining one-half of the costs and expenses. To the extent that the award of
the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any remediation amount is not
taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
3.3_, then within 10 days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Buyer and Seller of his or her award with respect to a remediation
amount, and subject to this _Section 4.3_ and the other terms and provisions
hereof, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer.

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
available in respect of Environmental Defects (A) for any Environmental Defect
Amount with respect to an individual Environmental Defect Property, if such
amount does not exceed $50,000 (each, an " _Individual Environmental Defect
Threshold_ "); and (B) unless the amount of all such Environmental Defect
Amounts (provided that each such Environmental Defect Amount exceeds the
Environmental Defect Threshold), in the aggregate (excluding
any Environmental Defect Amounts with respect to Environmental Defects cured
by Seller in accordance with this _Article IV_ ) exceeds three quarters of one
percent (0.75%) of the Purchase Price (adjusted for any Preference Rights
Assets, in an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Preference Rights
Assets less any purchase price adjustments agreed to between Seller and Third
Party with respect to the sale of such Preference Rights Assets, excluded from
this transaction pursuant to  _Section 13.3(c)_) (the " _Aggregate
Environmental Defect Deductible_ "), after which point, subject to the

 



27  Individual Environmental Defect Threshold, Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies elected by Seller in
accordance with _Section 4.3(g)_ only with respect to Environmental Defect
Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Environmental Defect Deductible and only
to the extent that Environmental Defect Amounts exceed the Aggregate
Environmental Defect Deductible. The Individual Environmental
Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Environmental Defect Deductible shall not
apply to any Property that is removed from this transaction or not transferred
to Buyer pursuant to _Section 4.3(g)_.

such inspections as Buyer deems appropriate. With respect to any of the Assets

each case, with respect to the Assets.

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the aggregate amount of any
such loss or taking exceeds 20% of the Purchase Price, either party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and Buyer shall be entitled
to promptly receive the Break-Up Fee from the Escrow Agent. If the aggregate
amount of any such loss or taking is 20% or less of the Purchase Price, Buyer

all sums paid or payable to Seller by Third Parties by reason of such casualty
or taking insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign, transfer and

and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights
against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims,
of or against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of such casualty or
taking insofar as with respect to the Assets; _provided, however_ , that in
the case of (ii), Seller shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to
Seller) all rights, title, interests and claims against Third Parties for the
recovery of Sellers costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date in
pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or other rights against Third
Parties or in defending or asserting rights in such condemnation or eminent
domain action with respect to the Assets. In the case of (i), Seller shall
retain all rights to insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against
Third Parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the
parties otherwise agree in writing.

 

(c) If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is
pending or threatened with respect to any Asset or portion thereof after the
date of this Agreement, but no taking of such Asset or portion thereof occurs
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and
Seller, at Closing, shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate
Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in such
condemnation or eminent domain action, including any future awards therein,
insofar as they are attributable to the Assets threatened to be taken,
except that Seller shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to
Seller) all rights, titles, interests and claims against Third Parties for the
recovery of Sellers costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in
defending or asserting rights in such action with respect to the Assets.

 



47 13.3 Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign.

 

(a) The provisions of this _Section 13.3_ shall apply to agreements relating
to the Properties which enable a Third Party to purchase a Property or any
part thereof, as a result of the sale of such Property or portion thereof to
Buyer (such rights hereafter referred to as " _Preference Rights_ "). Except
as set forth in this  _Section 13.3_, Buyer is purchasing the Properties
subject to all Preference Rights.

(b) Seller shall send notices of the transactions contemplated hereby to
holders of Preference Rights (" _Preference Notices_ ") set forth on _Schedule
5.10_. The Preference Notices shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, and shall include the Allocated Value of the Property or portion
thereof affected by each Preference Right. After receiving a response to a
Preference Notice, Seller shall promptly provide a copy of the response to
Buyer at the address set forth in this Agreement.

(c) In the event, and only in such event, the holder of a Preference Right
elects to properly exercise such Preference Right and to purchase the
Property subject thereto upon the Closing, Seller shall convey on
substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
Assignment attached to this Agreement (subject to such modifications as
deemed reasonably necessary by Buyer to reflect the relevant Preference Right
transaction, the price and the additional terms as contemplated by this
Agreement) the Property or portion of the Property subject to the Preference
Right to the holder of such Preference Right at the Closing; _provided,
however,_ that Seller shall have no obligation to convey any Property to a
Preference Right holder unless and until the Closing occurs and _provided
further_ that Seller shall: (i) convey to Buyer at Closing all Property
subject to Preference Rights for which the time for election to exercise such
Preference Right has expired and the Preference Right has not been properly
asserted; and (ii) retain all other Property subject to a Preference Right,
subject to Sellers obligation to convey such Property to Buyer at such
delayed Closing date to occur at the time that the election to exercise such
Preference Right has expired. The Purchase Price to be paid at Closing by
Buyer shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of all Properties for which a
Preference Right has been properly exercised and no other adjustments related
to such Property(ies) shall be made to the Purchase Price under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Property that is subject
to a Preference Right and held back at the initial Closing will be conveyed to
Buyer at a delayed Closing when the time for election to exercise such
Preference Right has expired (which shall become the new Closing Date with
respect to such Property). At the delayed Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller an
amount equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced on account
of the holding back of such retained Property (as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 3.3_ through the new Closing Date therefor).

(d) Buyer acknowledges that Seller desires to sell all of the Assets and
would not have entered into this Agreement but for Buyers agreement to
purchase all of the Assets as herein provided. Accordingly, it is expressly
understood and agreed that Seller does not desire to sell any Asset that is
subject to a Preference Right (collectively, the " _Preference Right Assets_
") unless the sale of all of the Assets is consummated on the Closing Date in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, subject to the penultimate

 



48  sentence of this _Section 13.3(d)_. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Sellers obligation hereunder to sell the Preference Right Assets to Buyer is
expressly conditioned upon the consummation on the Closing Date of the sale
of all of the Assets in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ that, nothing herein is intended or shall operate to extend or
apply any Preference Right to any portion of the Assets which is not
otherwise burdened thereby. In the event any holder of a Preference Right who
has properly exercised a Preference Right with respect to any Preference Right
Assets fails to consummate the sale of such Preference Right Assets on
the Closing Date, Closing shall not be delayed with respect to all other
Assets and Seller and Buyer shall have no further obligations or commitments
to each other regarding such Preference Right Assets. Time is of the essence
with respect to the parties agreement to consummate the sale of the Assets
on the Closing Date.

(e) In addition, Seller shall send to each holder of a right to consent to
assignment pertaining to the Assets and the transactions contemplated hereby a
notice seeking such partys consent to the transaction contemplated hereby. If
Seller fails to obtain a consent prior to the Closing and the failure to
obtain such consent would cause the assignment of such Asset to Buyer to be
void, then Seller shall continue to hold the operating rights or other legal
title to such Asset as nominee for Buyer. Seller shall not be obligated to
incur any expenses, obligations or other liabilities, or be responsible for
any Claims, in Sellers capacity as nominee and Buyer shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Seller in relation to such Assets. Seller and Buyer, as
between themselves, shall treat and deal with such Assets as if full legal and
equitable title to such Assets had passed from Seller to Buyer at Closing. If
Seller fails to obtain a consent prior to Closing and such consent does not
relate to a material Asset or the failure to obtain such consent would not
cause the assignment of such Asset to Buyer to be void, then Seller shall
convey such Asset to Buyer at Closing but Buyer shall have no rights or
remedies against Seller with respect thereto.

ARTICLE XIV

ASSUMPTION; INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL

14.1 _Assumption of Obligations by Buyer_. Subject to _Section 14.2_, from

obligations under the Chevron Agreement (all of said obligations and
Liabilities referenced in this _Section 13.1_ , subject to the exclusions
below, are herein referred to as the " _Assumed Obligations_ "); _provided_ ,
Buyer does not assume any obligations or Liabilities of Seller to the extent
that they are attributable to or arise out of any matter disclosed on
_Schedule 5.5_ or the ownership, use or operation of the Excluded Assets.

14.2 _Indemnities of Seller_. Effective as of the Closing, subject to the
limitations in this _Article XIV_ , Seller shall be responsible for, and
hereby agrees to defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever release Buyer
and its Affiliates and all of its and their respective stockholders, partners,
members, directors, officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Liabilities, arising from, based upon, related to or associated with:

(a) any act or omission by Seller involving or relating to the Excluded
Assets;

(b) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller contained in
_Article V_ or _VI_ ;

(c) any breach of Sellers covenants or agreements contained in _Section
8.1_, _8.4_ and _13.3_ ;

 

(d) any matter disclosed on _Schedule 5.5_ ; and

 

(e) bodily injury, illness or death or Third Party property damage arising out
of, incident to or in connection with operations on the Assets prior to the
Closing Date.

14.3 _Indemnities of Buyer_. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer and each of
its successors and assigns shall jointly and severally assume, be responsible
for, and hereby agree to defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever release
Seller and its Affiliates and all of their respective stockholders, partners,
members, directors, officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Liabilities arising from, based upon, related to or associated with:

(a) the Assumed Obligations;

 

(b) ownership or operation of the Assets after the Effective Time, including,
without limitation, the claims and expenses in _Section 16.17(b)_ ;

(c) environmental defects, including Environmental Conditions, related
or attributable to the Assets;

 



50 (d) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer contained in 
_Article VII_ ; and

(e) any breach of Buyers covenants or agreements.

 

14.4 _Express Negligence_. The indemnification, release and Assumed
Obligations provided for in this Agreement shall be applicable whether or not
the liabilities, losses, costs, expenses and damages in question arose or
resulted solely or in part from the gross, sole, active, passive, concurrent
or comparative negligence, strict liability or other fault or violation of
law of or by any Indemnified Party. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that this
statement complies with the express negligence rule and is conspicuous.

14.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification under
_Sections 14.2_ and _14.3_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under, and shall
not assert any claim for indemnification pursuant to, _Section 14.2_ until
the aggregate amount of such claims exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price (adjusted
for any Preference Rights Assets, in an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of such Preference Rights Assets less any purchase price adjustments agreed to
between Seller and Third Party with respect to the sale of such Preference
Rights Assets, excluded from this transaction pursuant to  _Section
13.3(c)_) (the " _Indemnification Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent
the claim exceeds the Indemnification Deductible. In no event will Buyer be
entitled to indemnification under  _Section 14.2_ once the aggregate of all
claims made under such Section equals 10% of the Purchase Price (adjusted for
any Preference Rights Assets, in an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Preference Rights Assets less any purchase price adjustments agreed to
between Seller and Third Party with respect to the sale of such Preference
Rights Assets, excluded from this transaction pursuant to _Section 13.3(c)_)
(the " _Indemnification Cap_ "); _provided_ that the Indemnification
Deductible and the Indemnification Cap shall not apply with respect to any
claim for indemnification asserted under _Section 14.2(a)_ , _Section
14.2(c)_,  _Section 14.2(d) _or, solely with respect to the Fundamental
Representations, _Section 14.2(b)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that with
respect to any claim for indemnification asserted under _Section 14.2(a)_ , 
_Section 14.2(c)_, _Section 14.2(d)_ or, solely with respect to the
Fundamental Representations, _Section 14.2(b)_, Buyer will not be entitled to
indemnification under such Sections once the aggregate of all claims
made under such Sections equals the Purchase Price.

(b) For purposes of this _Article XIV_ , the term " _Indemnifying Party_ "
when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the party or
parties having an obligation to indemnify another party or parties with
respect to such Liabilities pursuant to this _Article XIV_ , and the term "
_Indemnified Party_ " when used in connection with particular Liabilities
shall mean the party or parties having the right to be indemnified with
respect to such Liabilities by another party or parties pursuant to this
_Article XIV_.

 



51 (c) To make a claim for indemnification under _Sections 14.2_ or  _14.3_ , an
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this
_Section 14.5_ , including the specific details of and specific basis under
this Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the
claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the
Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice
of a Claim as provided in this _Section 14.5_ shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under S _ections 14.2_ or _14.3_ (as
applicable) except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time
being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend
against the Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys
ability to defend against the claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

(d) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its liability to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Claim at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and
during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Section 14.5(e)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Claim or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely
affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered
by the indemnity).

 

(f) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Claim at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified
Partys choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its
liability and assume the defense of the Claim at any time prior to settlement
or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet

 



52  admitted its liability for a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send written
notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten days following receipt of
such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability for the Claim and (ii) if
liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed
settlement.

 

(g) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
(i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its liability for such
Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30-day period that it
has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities,
the amount of such Liabilities shall conclusively be deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 

14.6 _Survival_.

(a) Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made herein shall
terminate and cease to be of further force and effect on the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing or such later date after Closing as is expressly
stipulated in this Section for the survival thereof; except as to claims for
indemnification permitted by this _Article XIV_ as to which a bona fide Claim
Notice with respect to such Claim has been delivered to the applicable
Indemnifying Party on or prior to such date. If any Asset becomes a retained
Asset and the Closing with respect thereto is delayed pursuant to _Section
13.3_ , the parties respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements provided for in this Agreement with respect to such retained Asset
shall survive under this _Section 14.6_ in relation to such delayed Closing
rather than the initial Closing under this Agreement. In addition, the
definitions set forth in the Definitions section at the beginning of this
Agreement or in any other provision of this Agreement which are used in the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements which survive the
Closing pursuant to this Section shall survive the Closing to the extent
necessary to give operative effect to such surviving representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements. It is expressly agreed that:

 

(i) The Fundamental Representations, _Sections 8.3_ , _8.4_ , _8.5_ , _8.7_ ,
_13.3_ , _14.1_  and _Article VII_ shall survive indefinitely.

(ii) The covenants and agreements of Seller in  _Section 8.9(a)-(c)_ shall
terminate at Closing, other than the covenant in _Section 8.9(b)(i)(B)_ which
shall terminate on March 1, 2011.

 

(iii) The covenants and agreements of Buyer in _Section 8.6_ and _Section
8.9(d)_ shall survive the Closing for a period of seven years.

(iv) The agreements in _Section 3.3_ shall survive Closing until the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



53 (v) All covenants and obligations of Buyer not identified in the
preceding clauses (i) - (iii) shall survive until the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date.

(vi) The indemnities in _Article XIV_ shall terminate as of the termination
date of each respective covenant or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on
or before such termination date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the indemnities in _Section 14.2(d)_ and _14.2(e)_ shall
survive until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date.

14.7 _Non-Compensatory Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, none of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or Buyer, or
their respective Affiliates, any indirect, consequential, punitive or
exemplary damages or damages for lost profits of any kind arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except
to the extent any such party suffers such damages (including costs of defense
and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending of such
damages) to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and
reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against such
damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, and Seller, on behalf of each of Seller Indemnified
Parties, waive any right to recover punitive, special, exemplary and
consequential damages, including damages for lost profits, arising in
connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

14.8 _Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute
relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be
applicable to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.

14.9  _Materiality_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, for purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty
has been breached for purposes of this _Article XIV_ and the amount of damages
suffered by any Indemnified Party, each representation and warranty set forth
in this Agreement shall be read without regard to and without giving effect to
any "material," "materiality" or similar qualifications that may be contained
in any such representation or warranty.

14.10 _Title and Environmental Matters Not Applicable_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt,
the provisions of _Section 14.2_ shall not apply (a) in respect of title
matters, such matters being exclusively covered by _Article IV_ and the
special warranty of title provided by Seller in the Assignments, and (b) in
respect of environmental matters, such matters being exclusively covered by
_Article IV_.

 



54 ARTICLE XV

TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

15.1 _Right of Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein may be terminated at any time at or prior to Closing:

(a) by Seller, at Sellers option, if any of the conditions set forth in
_Article X_ have not been satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing Date,
or such other date agreed by Buyer and Seller in accordance with _Section
11.1_;

(b) by Buyer, at Buyers option, if any of the conditions set forth in
_Article IX_ , other than the condition in _Section 9.4_, have not been
satisfied on or before the Scheduled Closing Date, or such other date agreed
by Buyer and Seller in accordance with  _Section 11.1_; or

(c) by Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before March 31, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ ");

_provided, however_ , that no party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (a), (b) or (c) above if such party or its
Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

15.2 _Effect of Termination_. If the obligation to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of
_Section 15.1_ hereof, then, except as provided in _Section 3.2_ and except
for the provisions of _Sections 1.1_ , _12.2_ , _12.3_ , _14.7_ and this
_Section 15.2_ and _Article XVI_ (other than _Sections 16.2(b_ ), _16.7_ ,
_16.8_ , and  _16.9_ ), and any other provision hereof which, by its very
nature, must survive such termination so as to carry out the stated intent of
Buyer and Seller, this Agreement shall forthwith become of no further force or
effort and the parties shall have no liability or obligation hereunder except
and to the extent such termination results from the material breach by a party
of any of its covenants or agreements hereunder. Upon a material breach of
this Agreement by Seller that is not cured by the Closing Date, Buyer, at its
sole option and as its sole remedy, may (i) enforce specific performance, or
(ii) terminate this Agreement. In the event Buyer elects to terminate this
Agreement as set forth above and is permitted to do so pursuant to the
proviso in _Section 15.1_, Buyer shall be entitled to promptly receive the
Break-Up Fee from the Escrow Agent. If Seller terminates this Agreement under
_Section 15.1_, and Buyer has negligently or willfully failed to perform or
observe its covenants and agreements or is in material breach of its
representations and warranties hereunder, or Closing has otherwise not
occurred as a result of an act or omission of Buyer, Seller shall be entitled
to all remedies available at law or in equity and shall be entitled to
recover court costs and attorneys fees in addition to any other relief to
which Seller may be entitled.

ARTICLE XVI

MISCELLANEOUS

 

16.1 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All of the Exhibits and Schedules referred to
in this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference
and constitute a part of this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement and its

55  and Schedules prior to and as of the execution of this Agreement. Seller has
or may have set forth information on a Schedule in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter
set forth in one section of a Schedule need not be set forth in any other
section of such Schedule so long as its relevance to such other section of the
Schedule is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed
therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the Schedules to this Agreement may include
certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the
convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by Seller that
the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that
the matter is material. 

16.2 _Expenses and Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party

(including any applicable interest or penalties) incurred or imposed with
respect to the transactions described in this Agreement. Buyer shall assume
responsibility for, and shall bear and pay, all sales, use, excise, real
property transfer, gross receipts, goods and services, registration, capital,

in this Agreement. Seller shall assume responsibility for, and shall bear and
pay, all _ad valorem_ , property, severance, production, and similar taxes and
assessments based upon or measured by the ownership of the Assets, the
production of Hydrocarbons or the receipt of proceeds therefrom, but exclusive
of income taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) and assessed
against the Assets by any taxing authority for any period prior to the
Effective Time, and Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall bear and pay,
all such taxes and assessments assessed against the Assets by any taxing
authority for any period that begins on or after the Effective Time. For
purposes of this Agreement, the foregoing proration of _ad valorem_ and
property taxes shall be accomplished at the Closing based on the ratio of the
number of days in the year prior to (for Seller) and on and after (for Buyer)
the Effective Time to the total number of days in the year as applied to the
amount of _ad valorem_ and property taxes for the most recent year for which
the amount of such taxes can be finally determined at the Closing.

 

(c) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of all tax
returns relating to the transactions contemplated herein or for tax periods

56  report the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Properties. To the

Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, but makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy of such
values.

16.3 _Assignment_. Other than an assignment to an Affiliate of Buyer, this
Agreement may not be assigned by Buyer without prior written consent of
Seller. No assignment of any rights hereunder by Buyer shall relieve Buyer of
any obligations and responsibilities hereunder.

 

16.4 _Preparation of Agreement_. Both Seller and Buyer and their respective
counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the event of
any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on the
identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.

16.5 _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard
to all press releases or other public announcements issued or made concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, and, except as may be
required by applicable Laws or the applicable rules and regulations of any
governmental agency or stock exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue
any such press release or other publicity without the prior written consent
of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being agreed
that the exclusion of Buyers name from a press release by Seller shall be
reasonable if requested by Buyer).

 

16.6 _Notices_. All notices and communications required or permitted to be
given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, or

Any notice given in accordance herewith shall be deemed to have been given
when delivered to the addressee in person or by courier, or transmitted by
facsimile transmission during normal business hours, or upon actual receipt by
the addressee after such notice has either been delivered to an overnight
courier or deposited in the United States Mail, as the case may be. The
parties hereto may change the address, telephone numbers and facsimile numbers
to which such communications are to be addressed by giving written notice to
the other parties in the manner provided in this _Section 16.6_.

16.7 _Removal of Name_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case within 30
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the names "Anglo-Suisse
Offshore Partners, LLC" and any variants thereof from the Assets acquired
pursuant to this Agreement and, except with respect to such grace period for
eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks
or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

16.8 _Further Cooperation_. Without causing any representation or warranty to
survive the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver, or shall
cause to be executed and delivered from time to time, such further instruments
of conveyance and transfer, and shall take such other actions as any party may
reasonably request, to convey and deliver the Assets to Buyer, to perfect
Buyers title thereto, and to accomplish the orderly transfer of the Assets to
Buyer in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, whether before or after
the Closing. If any party hereto receives monies belonging to the other, such
amount shall immediately be paid over to the proper party. If an invoice or
other evidence of an obligation is received by a party, which is partially an
obligation of both Seller and Buyer, then the parties shall consult with each
other and each shall promptly pay its portion of such obligation to the
obligee.

16.9 _Filings, Notices and Certain Governmental Approvals_. Promptly after
Closing Buyer shall (a) record the Assignments of the Assets and all federal
assignments executed at the Closing in all applicable real property records
and/or, if applicable, all state or federal agencies, (b) send notices to
vendors supplying goods and services for the Assets of the

 



58  assignment of the Properties to Buyer and, if applicable, the designation of
Buyer as the operator thereof, (c) actively pursue the unconditional approval
of all applicable Governmental Authorities of the Assignments of the Assets
to Buyer and the designation of Buyer (if applicable), as the operator thereof
and (d) actively pursue all other consents and approvals that may be required
in connection with the assignment of the Assets to Buyer and the assumption
of the liabilities assumed by Buyer hereunder, that shall not have been
obtained prior to Closing. Buyer obligates itself to take any and all action
required by any Governmental Authority in order to obtain such unconditional
approval, including but not limited to, the posting of any and all bonds or
other security that may be required in excess of any applicable or existing
lease, pipeline or area-wide bond.

 

16.10 _Entire Agreement; Conflicts_. This Agreement, the Exhibits hereto and
the Confidentiality Agreement collectively constitute the entire agreement
among Seller and Buyer pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede
all prior agreements, understanding, negotiations and discussion, whether oral
or written, of the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof. There are
no warranties, representations or other agreements among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement or the Assignments and other documents expressly contemplated
hereby, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall be bound by or liable for any
alleged representation, promise, inducement or statements of intention not so
set forth. In the event of a conflict between the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the terms and provisions of any exhibit hereto, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control; _provided, however_ ,
that the inclusion in any of the exhibits hereto of terms and provisions not
addressed in this Agreement shall not be deemed a conflict, and all such
additional provisions shall be given full force and effect, subject to the
provisions of this _Section 16.10_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, this Agreement may be enforced only against, and any claims
or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may
be made only against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, manager, partner, equityholder, agent, attorney or
representative of any party hereto shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
or any claim related to tort or contract theories of Law.

 

16.11 _Parties in Interest_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller and Buyer and their
respective legal representatives, successors and assigns. No other Person
shall have any right, benefit, priority or interest hereunder or as a result
hereof or have standing to require satisfaction of the provisions hereof in
accordance with their terms.

16.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by an instrument
in writing executed by the parties hereto against whom enforcement is sought.

16.13 _Waiver; Rights Cumulative_. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by or on behalf of the party hereto waiving
compliance. No course of dealing on the part of Seller or 

 



59  Buyer, or their respective officers, employees, agents or representatives,
nor any failure by Seller or Buyer to exercise any of its rights under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of
such party at a later time to enforce the performance of such provision. No
waiver by any party of any condition, or any breach of any term, covenant,
representation, or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or
of any breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty. The
rights of Seller and Buyer under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the
exercise or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude the exercise
of any other right.

16.14 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction, Venue; Jury Waiver_. This Agreement and
the legal relations among the parties shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, excluding any conflicts of
law rule or principle that might refer construction of such provisions to the
laws of another jurisdiction. All of the parties hereto consent to the
exercise of jurisdiction in personam by the courts of the State of Texas for
any action arising out of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.
All actions or proceedings with respect to, arising directly or indirectly in
connection with, out of, related to, or from this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents shall be exclusively litigated in courts having situs
in Houston, Harris County, Texas. Each party hereto waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement.

16.15 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any adverse manner to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

16.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a party by facsimile
transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.

 

16.17 _Certain Other Governmental Approvals_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in _Section 16.9_, Buyer shall promptly (but in any event no later
than two Business Days after Closing) seek, and use its best efforts after
Closing to obtain, the unconditional approval by the BOEMRE of (i) the
Assignments of Record Title to Oil and Gas Lease(s) in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit C_ ; (ii) the Assignments of Oil and Gas Lease Operating
Rights in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ ; and (iii) the Assignments
of Rights of Way in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_. In the event
Buyer or its nominated operator is elected successor operator under the
operating agreements applicable to any of the Leases, Buyer also obligates
itself to ensure that it or the successor operator makes application to the
BOEMRE to qualify as operator with respect to that

 



60  portion of the Assets it will operate. Buyer shall take any actions
reasonably required of it by the BOEMRE or any other regulatory agencies to
obtain all requisite regulatory approvals, including but not limited to, the
purchase and posting of any and all bonds, supplemental bonds or other
securities which may be required of it pursuant to OPA and 30 C.F.R §§ 250.7,
256.58, 256.59, and 256.61 in excess of any existing lease, pipeline or area-
wide bond(s). Until the governmental approval with respect to an assignment
described in this _Section 16.17_ is obtained, however, the following shall
occur:

 

(a) Seller shall continue to hold the operating rights and record title to the
applicable Assets as nominee for Buyer; 

(b) Buyers indemnity under _Section 14.3_ shall include any and all claims,
expenses of any kind or character relating to the Assets accruing after the
Effective Time including but not limited to any bonding or regulatory costs
incurred by Seller;

(c) Seller shall act as Buyers nominee with respect to the Assets but shall
be authorized to act only upon and in accordance with Buyers specific written
instructions, and Seller shall have no authority, responsibility or
discretion to perform any tasks or functions with respect to the Assets other
than those which are purely administrative or ministerial in nature, unless
otherwise specifically requested and authorized by Buyer in writing; and

(d) Buyer shall continue to maintain and provide at its cost the insurance
coverages as reviewed by Seller under _Section 10.6_ of this Agreement.

If the BOEMRE does not, within twelve months from the Closing Date, approve
all (i) the Assignments of Record Title of the Leases into Buyer, (ii) the
Assignments of Oil and Gas Lease Operating Rights into Buyer, and (iii) the
Assignments of Rights of Way into Buyer, then:

 

(w) As to those Assignments that the BOEMRE has approved, the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement will proceed as to those Assets in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, _mutatis mutandis_ ; and

 

(x) As to those Assignments that the BOEMRE has not approved due to a reason
other than the BOEMREs delay in addressing otherwise valid filings by Buyer,
Seller, at its option, may either:

(i) continue to hold the operating rights, title to the Leases and the rights
of way as Buyers nominee, or,

(ii) upon 30 days notice to Buyer, rescind the purchase and sale of the
Assets that are the subject of such non-approvals and terminate this Agreement
as to those Assets, but only as to those Assets.

 

(y) The exercise by Seller of the option to rescind as specified in the
preceding clause (x)(ii), however, shall be predicated upon Sellers
reasonable determination either that (i) Buyer has failed to comply with the
requirements of 30 C.F.R. § 256.64 and not taken any and all actions required
by the BOEMRE to obtain 

 



61  such approval, or (ii) there had been a material adverse effect on the
financial condition of Buyer after Closing.

 

(z) Upon such termination and rescission, this Agreement shall be null and
void as between Buyer and Seller with respect to the non-approved Assets, and
(i) Buyer shall return to Seller the Assignments and any and all other
documents, materials and data previously delivered to Buyer with respect to
such Assets; and (ii) Seller shall return to Buyer the Purchase Price
allocated to such Assets in _Schedule 3.8_ , without interest, less the
proceeds of production net of all expenses, capital expenditures, royalties,
and costs of operations (including plugging and abandonment expenses
but excluding mortgage interest and any burdens or encumbrances created by
Buyer which shall be released prior to this payment) attributable to the
Leases and other rights from and after the Effective Time. In no event,
however, shall Seller ever be required to reimburse Buyer for any
expenditures associated with workovers, recompletions, or the drilling,
completion or plugging and abandonment of wells drilled or work performed by
Buyer on or with respect to such Assets unless same were necessary to
perpetuate the related Leases or operating rights or other rights. Seller
shall not be liable to Buyer if the BOEMRE approvals are not obtained, except
as expressly provided in this _Section 16.17_.

 

16.18 _Adequacy of Supplemental Bonds or Arrangements for the Pledge of
Securities_. Prior to execution hereof, Buyer shall confer with the BOEMRE
regarding the amounts and terms for the posting of supplemental bonds or
pledge of securities pursuant to the provisions of 30 C.F.R §§ 256.61 and
250.7, and within a reasonable time of any BOEMRE determination pursuant to
such regulations, Buyer (directly or through its representative) shall satisfy
the BOEMRE requirements concerning same, including all financial
responsibility requirements under OPA.

 

16.19 _Special Offshore Interests_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
those offshore Assets described on the attached  _Schedule 16.19_ are in the
nature of contract rights that are not recognized by the BOEMRE as "record
title" or "operating rights," and that, accordingly, the BOEMRE will not
approve, and Buyer and Seller do not expect the BOEMRE to approve, the
assignment of these interests from Seller to Buyer. Buyer shall ensure
nevertheless that the assignment documents relating to such interests are
appropriately filed in the "non-required filing" system of the BOEMRE. Such
interests shall be excluded from the scope of _Section 16.17_ for all
purposes.

 



62 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the day and
year first above written.
