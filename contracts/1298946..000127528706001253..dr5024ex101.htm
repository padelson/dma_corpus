18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BULK SALES.&#160;&#160; Seller has requested
(a) a certificate issued by the Illinois Department of Revenue showing that
Seller has no liability for the payment of any assessed but unpaid tax, penalty
or interest under the Illinois Income Tax Act and any tax, penalty or interest
due under the Retailer&#146;s Occupation Tax Act and (b) a certificate issued by
the City of Chicago Department of Revenue&#146;s Tax Division Bulk Sales Unit
showing that Seller has no liability for the payment of any assessed but unpaid
tax, penalty or interest under the Uniform Revenue Procedures Ordinance, Chapter
3-4 and any tax, penalty or interest due under the ordinance (collectively, the
&#147;Tax Certificates&#148;).&#160; If Seller receives any Tax Certificate
prior to Closing, Seller shall deposit the amount of taxes set forth in such Tax
Certificates in a joint order escrow with the Title Company (the &#147;Tax
Escrow&#148;) at the Closing; and, if Seller receives a Tax Certificate after
Closing, Seller shall deposit the amount of taxes set forth in such Tax
Certificate in the Tax Escrow within five (5) business days after receipt of the
Tax Certificate.&#160; The amount in the Tax Escrow shall either be released to
pay such taxes when they come due and payable or released to Seller upon
delivery to Purchaser of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that
Purchaser no longer has any liability for such taxes.&#160; Until the Tax
Certificates are obtained and the amount of taxes set forth therein placed in
the Tax Escrow, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless from
and against any and all liabilities, claims, demands, causes of action, losses,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, court costs and
disbursements) which may arise out of Seller&#146;s failure to obtain the
Tax Certificates.&#160; Such indemnity shall not be subject to the $5,000,000
cap on Seller&#146;s indemnified obligations set forth in Section 12(E)
above.&#160; Seller shall cause Guarantor to deliver to Purchaser at the Closing
a guaranty of Seller&#146;s obligations under this Section 18 (the
&#147;Seller&#146;s Guaranty&#148;) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit U
duly executed by the Guarantor.&#160; The provisions of this Section 18 shall
