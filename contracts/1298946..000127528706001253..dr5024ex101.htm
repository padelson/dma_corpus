Seller on the terms and conditions set forth herein and shall pay to Seller

($295,000,000), subject to prorations as set forth below; provided that, if

a credit against the balance of the Purchase Price payable at Closing in an
amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of the Wachovia Loan as of
Closing.

 

  B. Earnest Money.

this Agreement, Purchaser shall deposit FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,000,000) with
the Title Company (such amount, together with all interest earned thereon, are
herein collectively called the "Earnest Money"). If Purchaser fails to deposit
the Earnest Money when due hereunder with the Title Company, this Agreement
shall be null and void. The Earnest Money shall be held by the Title Company
in accordance with the terms hereof and invested in a money market account in
a commercial bank acceptable to Seller and Purchaser. If this Agreement is
terminated prior to Closing due to Purchasers default hereunder, the Earnest
Money shall be paid to Seller as liquidated damages and as Sellers sole and
exclusive remedy hereunder. If the Closing occurs hereunder, the Earnest
Money shall be paid to Seller and credited against the Purchase Price. If the
Closing does not occur hereunder for any reason other than Purchasers default
hereunder, the Earnest Money shall be refunded to Purchaser.

  

 (ii) In no event shall the Title Company in its capacity as escrow holder hereunder be liable for any act or failure to act under the provisions of this Agreement except where Title Companys acts are the result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Accordingly, the Title Company shall not incur any liability with respect to (a) any action taken or omitted in good faith upon advice of its legal counsel given with respect to any questions relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Title Company in its capacity as escrow holder under this Agreement or (b) any action taken or omitted in reliance on any instrument, including any written notice or instruction provided for in this Agreement, not only as to its due execution and the validity and effectiveness of its provisions but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which the Title Company shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been signed or conform with the provisions of this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser hereby jointly and severally indemnify the Title Company against any loss, liability, or damage (including costs of litigation and reasonable attorneys fees) arising from and in connection with the performance of the Title Company of its duties as escrow holder under this Agreement, whether such dispute arises between the parties hereto and others, or merely between themselves, it being understood and agreed that the Title Company may interplead such dispute, and Seller and Purchaser will hold the Title Company harmless and indemnify it against all consequences and expenses which may be incurred by the Title Company in connection with the performance by Title Company of its duties as escrow holder under this agreement, except those consequences and expenses arising by reason of the Title Companys gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 (i)

  |  

 If Purchaser elects to assume the Wachovia Loan, Purchaser shall notify
Seller in writing within 3 business days after the date hereof and with such
notice, shall simultaneously deliver to Wachovia Bank a check in the amount of
$7,500 payable to "Wachovia Bank, N.A." (representing the non-refundable
application fee payable to Wachovia Bank in connection with the assumption of
the Wachovia Loan). Promptly upon receipt of such notice from Purchaser,
Seller shall request that Wachovia Bank consent to the assumption of the
Wachovia Loan by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.
In connection with the assumption of the Wachovia Loan, Purchaser and Seller
shall comply with requirements set forth in the Loan Documents and with any
commercially reasonable and customary requests for additional information made
by Wachovia Bank in connection with such request for consent. Assuming
(A) Wachovia Bank approves the assumption of the Wachovia Loan by Purchaser ,
(B) all conditions to the assumption of the Loan set forth in the Loan
Document are satisfied (or waived) and (C) Wachovia Bank approves an affiliate
of Purchaser as a replacement guarantor with respect to all obligations under
the Wachovia Loan guaranteed by affiliates of Seller and agrees to release
such affiliates of Seller from all obligations arising under such guarantees
arising from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser may assume the Wachovia
Loan at Closing, in which case the principal balance of the Wachovia Loan
outstanding as of the Closing shall be credited against the Purchase Price;
and Purchaser and Seller shall prorate the interest on the Wachovia Loan as of
the Closing Date with Purchaser responsible for interest accrued on the
Closing Date. In such case, Purchaser shall be responsible for all costs
incurred to assume the Wachovia Loan (other than Sellers legal
fees), including any assumption fees and other assumption costs, such as
application fees, Wachovia Banks legal expenses and title insurance costs in
each case related to the assumption of the Wachovia Loan (as opposed to the
origination or original making of the Wachovia Loan); provided, however,
Seller shall pay any origination fee for the Wachovia Loan. If the Wachovia
Loan is assumed by Purchaser, at the Closing, Seller shall transfer to
Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest to any reserve or escrow
accounts held by Seller or Wachovia Bank or their agents in connection with
the Wachovia Loan, and Seller shall be entitled to receive a credit against
the Purchase Price in the amount equal to the outstanding balance of such
reserve or escrow accounts transferred to Purchaser. If Purchaser timely
delivers the notice required in the first sentence of this clause (i) ,
Purchaser may extend the Closing Date for up to forty-five (45) days in order
to give Purchaser time to complete the documentation for the loan assumption;
but the assumption of the Wachovia Loan shall not in any event be a condition
of Closing; or
    
        

 (ii)

  |  

 If any of the conditions set forth in clause (i) above are not satisfied as
of the Closing Date (as the same may be extended as provided in this
Agreement) or if Purchaser elects not to assume the Wachovia Loan, Purchaser
shall pay Seller the full Purchase Price at Closing as set forth herein; and
Seller shall cause the Wachovia Loan to be paid off and discharged at Closing.
In such case, (i) Purchaser shall reimburse Seller at Closing for the
prepayment fee of 1.5% of the Wachovia Loan and for any other costs and
expenses incurred by Seller under the Loan Documents with respect to the
prepayment of the Wachovia Loan, including without limitation LIBOR Breakage
Costs and, to the extent such prepayment occurs on a date that is not a
"Payment Date" (as defined in the Loan Documents), interest due from the
Closing Date through and including the last day of the then-current "Interest
Accrual Period" (as defined in the Loan Documents); provided, however, that
Purchaser may extend the Closing Date in order that the Closing shall occur on
a "Payment Date" unless Seller agrees to pay the interest on the Wachovia Loan
otherwise payable with respect to the period of such extension, and (ii) the
Loan Documents shall not be Permitted Exceptions. Unless Purchaser provides
written notice to Seller at least 7 days prior to the Closing Date that the
conditions set forth in clause (i) above have not be satisfied or that
Purchaser has elected not to assume the Wachovia Loan, Seller may extend the
Closing Date for up to 15 days in order to provide Wachovia Bank with the
notice of prepayment required by the Wachovia Loan.

to Seller (it being agreed by Seller that the documents attached hereto as
Exhibits are satisfactory in form to Seller), all of which shall have been
deposited by Purchaser in escrow with the Title Company at least one (1)
business day prior to the Closing Date:

 

  (a) payment of the Purchase
Price, plus or minus prorations;

 

  (b) counterparts of the
Assignment of Contracts, the Assignment of Tenant Leases, the Assignment of
Equipment Leases and, if applicable, the Assignment of Loan Documents, each
executed (and to the extent required, acknowledged) by Purchaser;    
  

  (c) a closing statement
setting forth all prorations and credits required hereunder, executed by
Seller;

  

 (d) such evidence as Seller or the Title Company may reasonably require as to the due, authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and the documents required to be executed by Purchaser hereunder; 

 

  (e) a certificate executed by
Purchaser reaffirming that Purchasers representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects as of
the Closing, provided such certificate shall be subject to the qualifications
and limitations on Purchasers liabilities set forth in this Agreement; and

 

  (f) such state, county or
city sales or realty transfer tax forms or certifications as Purchaser may be
required to execute in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

  D. Prorations. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Section 7(D), all items of income and expense of the Project with respect
to the period prior to 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date (the "Apportionment
Time") shall be for the account of Seller, and all items of income and expense
of the Project with respect to the period after the Apportionment Time shall
be for the account of Purchaser. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this section, all prorations shall be on an accrual basis in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles (except as set forth herein), and
based on the actual number of days in the applicable period. The Purchase
Price for the Project shall be subject to prorations and credits as follows to
be determined as of the Apportionment Time, the Closing Date being a day of
income and expense to Purchaser; provided, however, if Sellers bank does not
receive the Purchase Price by 1:00 p.m. its time on the Closing Date, the
prorations shall be determined as of 12:01 a.m. on the first business day
following the Closing Date:

  1. Hotel Receivables and Payables. Since Marriott owns
all working capital for the Project and remits to Seller each month Sellers
share of net operating income (excluding any adjustment for real estate taxes,
rents under the Tenant Leases and parking charges for the Project which are
paid or collected directly by Seller) from the operation of the Project (the
"Net Operating Income"), there will be no proration of receivables and
payables from the Project at Closing; but instead Seller shall be entitled to
all Net Operating Income for the period prior to the Closing Date and
Purchaser shall be entitled to all Net Operating Income for the period from
and after the Closing Date. Net Operating Income for the accounting period in
which the Closing occurs shall be prorated at Closing based on the portion of
the accounting period during which Seller and Purchaser owned the Project and
based on Marriotts forecast of Net Operating Income for such accounting
period. Promptly after the actual Net Operating Income for such accounting
period has been finally determined by Marriott, Seller and Purchaser shall
reprorate the Net Operating Income for such accounting period based on the
actual amount of Net Operating Income for such accounting period. In addition,
Seller and Purchaser shall prorate at Closing the interest charged by Manager
on the working capital supplied by Manager for the Project in the same manner.

  |  

  2. Rents payable under Tenant Leases. Any portion of
any rents under Tenant Leases collected subsequent to the Closing Date and
properly allocable to periods prior to the Closing shall be paid, promptly
after receipt, to Seller; and any portion thereof properly allocable to
periods subsequent to the Closing Date, if any, shall be paid to Purchaser.
Any advance rental payments or deposits paid by tenants under Tenant Leases
prior to the Closing Date and applicable to the period of time subsequent to
the Closing Date and any security deposits or other amounts paid by tenants
under Tenant Lease shall be credited to Purchaser on the Closing Date. No
credit shall be given Seller for accrued and unpaid rent or any other non-
current sums due from tenants under Tenant Leases until said sums are paid.    
        

 

  |  

  3. Taxes. Real estate taxes shall be prorated based on
the real estate taxes due and payable for the first half of the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs regardless of when such taxes accrue, i.e., the
real estate taxes to be prorated shall be the first installment of the 2005
real estate taxes payable in calendar year 2006, and Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for the second installment of the 2005 real estate taxes payable
in 2006 and the 2006 real estate taxes payable in calendar year 2007. As a
result, since the first installment of the 2005 real estate taxes payable in
2006 shall have been paid prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall give Seller a
credit for real estate taxes equal to such first installment paid by Seller
minus Sellers share thereof (Sellers share being equal to such first
installment times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
calendar year 2006 prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
181). Such proration shall be final and not subject to reproration when the
final tax bill for 2005 real estate taxes has been issued, and Purchaser shall
be responsible for any real estate tax increases for 2005 real estate taxes.
Purchaser shall also give Seller a credit for a prorata portion of any costs
incurred by Seller in protesting such taxes or the assessments on the Project,
and Seller shall also give Purchaser a credit for any special assessments
which are levied or charged against the Project and due and payable prior to
Closing.

  4. Tax Refunds or Rebates. Seller shall be entitled to
any real estate tax refunds or rebates attributable to 2004 real estate taxes
and years prior thereto. Seller shall be entitled to its pro rata share of any
real estate tax refunds or rebates attributable to 2005 real estate taxes,
which pro rata share shall be calculated in the same manner as the calculation
of Sellers real estate tax credit under Section 7D(3) above, i.e. without the
benefit of any adjustment based on the final tax bill for 2005 real estate
taxes. By way of example, if the first installment of the 2005 real estate
taxes payable in 2006 is $600.00, the second installment of 2005 real estate
taxes payable in 2006 is $4,200.00, the Closing Date occurs on February 1,
2006 and a tax refund or rebate for 2005 real estate taxes is issued in the
amount of $2,400.00 (i.e 50% of the entire tax bill for 2005 real estate
taxes), then Seller shall be entitled to $50.00 of such tax refund or rebate
(i.e 50% of the amount Seller effectively paid for 2005 real estate taxes due
to the credit Seller received at Closing, as opposed to the entirety of the
credit attributable to January, 2006) and Purchaser shall be entitled to the
balance, less any reasonable third-party costs of collection incurred by
Seller prior to the Closing Date, which shall be credited to Seller. Purchaser
shall also be entitled to any real estate tax refunds or rebates for calendar
year 2006 and thereafter. Seller shall have the sole right to settle or
contest any real estate taxes attributable to 2004 real estate taxes, and
Purchaser shall have the sole right to settle or contest any real estate taxes
attributable to 2005 real estate taxes and thereafter.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  5. Parking Charges. All parking charges for the full
night preceding the Closing Date shall be shared equally by Seller and
Purchaser. All other parking charges incurred for the period prior to the
Apportionment Time shall belong to and be apportioned to Seller and all other
parking charges incurred for the period after the Apportionment Time shall
belong to and be apportioned to Purchaser.

  
     



  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  6. FFandE Loan. Purchaser shall give Seller a credit at
Closing equal to the unpaid amount of all "Advances" under the Funding
Agreement.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  7. FFandE Reserve. Purchaser shall give Seller a credit
at Closing equal to the amount of the FFandE Reserve held by Manager under the
Management Agreement.

  
   

  Each party shall cause its designated representatives to enter the
Project only at reasonable times and without unreasonably interfering with
operations, both before and after the Closing Date, for the purpose of making
such examinations, and audits of the Project, and of the books and records of
the Project, as they deem necessary to make the adjustments and prorations
required under this Section 7(D) or under any other provisions of this
Agreement. Based upon such examinations and audits, at the Closing, the
representatives of the parties shall jointly prepare and deliver to each party
a preliminary closing statement which shall show the net amount due either to
Seller or Purchaser as a result thereof, and such net amount will be added to,
or subtracted from the payment of the Purchase Price to be paid to Seller.
Within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Seller
and Purchaser shall agree on a post closing statement setting forth any
adjustments to the preliminary closing statement prepared. The net amount due
Seller or Purchaser, if any, by reason of adjustments to the preliminary
closing statement as shown in the post closing statement, shall be paid in
cash by the party obligated therefore within ten (10) days following the date
of the post closing statement. In addition, Seller and Purchaser shall agree
on a final closing statement setting forth the final determination of all
items to be included on such final closing statement no later than December 1,
2006. The net amount due Seller or Purchaser, if any, by reason of adjustments
to the post closing statement as shown in the final closing statement, shall
be paid in cash by the party obligated therefore within ten (10) days
following the date of the final closing statement.    
  

 If Seller and Purchaser, each acting reasonably and in good faith, cannot resolve any issue with respect to the adjustments described in this section, they shall submit such issue for binding resolution by a nationally recognized accounting firm either mutually acceptable to both parties or, if the parties cannot agree, selected by the American Arbitration Association ("Accounting Firm") . The parties shall bear equally all fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in connection with the resolution of such issue, and each party shall bear its own legal, accounting and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of the issue by the Accounting Firm. Such resolution shall be final and binding on the parties and judgment may be entered upon such resolution in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Seller and Purchaser agree that the proceeding described in this section shall be conducted in Bethesda, Maryland.

 

  The provisions of this Section 7(D) shall survive the Closing
until payment of the final adjustment due under the final closing statement.

 

  E. Expenses. Seller shall pay (1) any transfer taxes
imposed by the State of Illinois and the County of Cook in connection with the
recording of the Deed; (2) Title Commitment charges , together with the
premium for the Owners Policy (defined above), excluding the cost of any
endorsements (other than the cost to provide extended coverage or the cost of
any endorsement with respect to any Title Objections or other exceptions to
title Seller has elected to cure pursuant to Section 7(F), as to which Seller
shall be responsible), (3) one-half of any escrow or closing fees charged by
the Title Company, (4) the cost of the survey of the Project, together with
any updates thereto, and (5) its own legal expenses. Purchaser shall pay (1)
any transfer taxes imposed by the City of Chicago in connection with the
recording of the Deed, (2) the costs of endorsements to the Owners Policy
for which Seller is not responsible, (3) any taxes on the transfer of the
Personal Property, (4) one-half of any escrow or closing fees charged by the
Title Company, and (6) Purchasers own due diligence and legal expenses. Any
other closing expenses shall be allocated in accordance with the custom in
Chicago, Illinois.

  

 F. Title. Purchaser has heretofore obtained (i) a survey of the Project, dated February 12, 2004, prepared by Gremley and Beidermann, Inc. as Order No. 992008 (the "Survey") and (ii) a current title insurance commitment for the Project (the "Title Commitment"). Purchaser acknowledges that it shall not be entitled to object to, and shall be deemed to have approved the Permitted Exceptions and any matters shown on the Survey. If, after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, new title exceptions that were not previously reported in the Title Commitment or shown on the Survey are disclosed on an update of the Title Commitment or Survey, Purchaser shall have the earlier of five (5) business days or the occurrence of the Closing Date to approve such updates to the Survey and Title Commitment. All matters showing thereon which are approved by Purchaser shall be deemed "Permitted Exceptions." If Purchaser disapproves any such matters as set forth above, Seller shall have five (5) business days in which to elect in its sole discretion to cause to be released and discharged of record or cause to be insured over (at no cost to Purchaser) on or prior to Closing any matters which Purchaser has disapproved; provided, however, Seller shall in any event cause to be discharged and released of record  on or prior to the Closing any (i) delinquent taxes, or mortgages, deeds of trust and security agreements securing indebtedness or obligations which were created or expressly assumed by or on behalf of Seller, (ii) judgment liens or construction, mechanics, materialmens or other similar liens or charges arising by operation of law, which judgments or other such liens or charges do not exceed the sum of $250,000 in the aggregate and are not the obligation of the Manager provided Seller may instead cause such liens or charges to be insured over at no cost to Purchaser, (iii) liens or encumbrances that Seller has intentionally caused to be placed on the Property after the date hereof, and (iv) any other liens or encumbrances placed on the Property after the date hereof provided the    
   

cost of discharging such liens and encumbrances does not exceed $100,000 in
the aggregate and provided further Seller may instead cause such liens and
encumbrances up to a maximum of $100,000 to be insured over at no cost to
Purchaser (in each case other than Permitted Exceptions) (items (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) collectively being the "Title Objections"). Seller may extend
the Closing Date for up to thirty (30) days in order to cure any title
exceptions which Seller has elected or is obligated to cure hereunder. If
Seller does not provide a response to Purchaser within the five (5) business
day period referenced above, Seller shall be deemed to have elected to not
cure the title matter objected to by Purchaser. If Seller does not elect to
correct or have insured over any matters disapproved by Purchaser as set forth
above as to which Seller is not obligated to have discharged and released or
insured over by Closing, Purchaser shall have five (5) business days after
Sellers election or deemed election in which to elect either to (x) waive its
objection to such matters, in which case such matters shall be deemed
Permitted Exceptions and the transfer contemplated hereby shall close as
scheduled with no adjustment to the Purchase Price, other than the cost to
cure such matters which Seller is obligated to cure as set forth above, or (y)
terminate this Agreement and obtain a refund of the Earnest Money, following
which the parties hereto shall be released from all further obligations
hereunder, except those which expressly survive a termination of this
Agreement. Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this
Agreement if Purchaser does not notify Seller of its election within such five
(5) business day period. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall have the
Survey certified to Purchaser, Title Company and Wachovia Bank, and Seller
shall cause the Survey to be updated to the extent required by Title Company
or Wachovia Bank.

 

  SECTION 8. WAIVER; SEVERABILITY. Each party hereto
may, at any time or times, at its election, waive any of the conditions to its
obligations hereunder by a written waiver expressly detailing the extent of
such waiver (and no other waiver or alleged waiver by such party shall be
effective for any purpose). No such waiver shall reduce the rights or remedies
of such party by reason of any breach by the other party or parties of any of
its or their obligations hereunder. If any term, covenant, condition or
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, shall to any extent be held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, covenants,
conditions or provisions of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance, shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby.

  

 SECTION 9. BROKERS. Purchaser and Seller each represents and warrants to the other that it has not hired any brokers or finders in connection with the transaction set forth herein. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against any and all Damages resulting from a breach of the foregoing representation or any claim that may be made by any broker or other person claiming a commission, fee or other compensation by reason of having dealt with Purchaser in connection with this transaction including, without limitation, any Damage incurred in enforcing this indemnity. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser from and against any and all Damages resulting from a breach of the foregoing representation or any claim that may be made by any broker or other person claiming a commission, fee or other compensation by reason of having dealt with Seller in connection with this transaction including, without limitation, any Damage incurred in enforcing this indemnity. This Section 9 shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

 

  SECTION 10. FURTHER INSTRUMENTS. Each party will,
whenever and as often as it shall be requested so to do by the other, cause to
be executed, acknowledged or delivered any and all such further instruments
and documents as may be necessary or proper, in the reasonable opinion of the
requesting party, in order to carry out the intent and purpose of this
Agreement and as is consistent with this Agreement.    
  

  SECTION 11. ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFITS.
Purchaser may not assign its rights under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Seller except to an entity controlled by Purchaser (in
which event the transferee shall assume in writing all of the transferors
obligations hereunder and the transferor shall remain liable hereunder).
Purchaser shall notify Seller at least ten (10) days prior to Closing of any
assignment of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement is made
for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Seller and their respective successors
and assigns, and no other person or persons shall have any right or remedy or
other legal interest of any kind under or by reason of this Agreement. Whether
or not either party hereto elects to employ any or all the rights, powers or
remedies available to it hereunder, such party shall have no obligation or
liability of any kind to any third party by reason of this Agreement or by
reason of any of such partys actions or omissions pursuant hereto or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby except as set forth above.

  

 SECTION 12. REMEDIES.

 

  A. If Purchaser defaults hereunder in any
material respect prior to Closing, Sellers sole remedy shall be to either
terminate this Agreement and recover the Earnest Money and Extension Deposit
(if any) as liquidated damages or waive its right to terminate and instead
proceed to Closing; provided, however, Seller shall also be entitled to its
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses as provided in Section 14 below. The
parties agree that Sellers damages in the event of a default by Purchaser
prior to Closing will be difficult to determine and that the Earnest Money and
Extension Deposit (if any) are a fair estimate of those damages. If Seller
shall default hereunder in any material respect prior to Closing, Purchaser
shall be entitled as its sole remedies to terminate this Agreement and obtain
a refund of the Earnest Money and Extension Deposit (if any), waive its right
to terminate and instead proceed to Closing or sue for specific performance of
this Agreement without any abatement of the Purchase Price (other than the
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses,
actually incurred by Purchaser or its affiliates in connection with the
foregoing); and Purchaser waives any other rights or remedies at law or
equity; provided, however, Purchaser shall also be entitled to its reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses as provided in Section 14 below. Upon the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12(A), neither party
shall have any further obligations or liabilities to the other party, except
for obligations that expressly survive termination of this Agreement.

 

  B. Subject to Section 12(E) hereof, Seller
hereby agrees to indemnify Purchaser, and its directors, officers, employees,
partners, agents, representatives, members and affiliates (collectively,
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties"), and to hold the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties harmless from and against, any and all any and all damages,
liabilities, losses, claims, penalties, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) actually incurred by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party ("Damages") that are due to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in Sections 3 and 9 of this
Agreement, (ii) any breach of the covenants set forth in Section 5(A)(4) and
Section 5(A)(11) provided, however, Seller shall not be responsible for
any actions of the Manager which are contrary to such Sections, and (iii)
liabilities under the Service and Supply Contracts, Property Agreements,
Tenant Leases, Equipment Leases and Loan Agreement to the extent arising prior
to the Closing Date or otherwise relating to the period prior to the Closing
Date (except to the extent that Purchaser receives a credit therefor at
Closing); provided, however, that Damages pursuant to this subsection (ii)
shall be limited to the amount of expense that would be incurred by Seller
under the Management Agreement, giving effect to the Incentive Management Fee
provided for thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
indemnity, Purchaser shall not assume, and nothing in this Agreement shall
make Purchaser or any of its affiliates become obligated with respect to, any
(a) liabilities arising prior to the Closing Date unless Purchaser expressly
assumed such liabilities or received a credit for such liability at Closing or
(b) liabilities for any federal, state or local income or franchise tax of
Seller or any of its affiliates.    
  

 C. Subject to Section 12(E) hereof, Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify Seller, and its directors, officers and employees, partners, agents, representatives, members and affiliates (collectively, "Seller Indemnified Parties"), and to hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, any and all Damages paid or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties due to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in Sections 4 and 9 of this Agreement, (ii) any obligations with respect to which Purchaser receives a credit at Closing, to the extent of such credit, and (iii) liabilities under the Service and Supply Contracts, Property Agreements, Tenant Leases, Equipment Leases and Loan Agreement to the extent arising from and after the Closing Date or otherwise relating to the period from and after the Closing Date (except to the extent that Seller receives a credit therefor at Closing); provided, however, that Damages pursuant to this subsection (iii) shall be limited to the amount of expense that would be incurred by Purchaser under the Management Agreement, giving effect to the Incentive Management Fee provided for thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing indemnity, nothing in this Agreement shall make Seller become obligated with respect to, any liabilities for any federal, state or local income or franchise tax of Purchaser or any of its affiliates.

 

  D. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 12, the obligations of Seller under Section 12(B)(iii) and
Purchaser under Section 12(C)(iii) shall not extend to (i) any Damages arising
out of the alleged presence at, or release or disposal from the Project of any
Hazardous Substance in violation of any Environmental Laws, (ii) any Damages
arising out of a violation of any applicable legal requirement with respect to
the physical condition, maintenance or improvement of the Project (including
zoning and building codes and the Americans with Disabilities Act), or (iii)
any Damages arising out of the state of the physical condition, maintenance or
improvement of the Project, except (in the case of this clause (iii) only)
Damages for the death of or injury to third parties, or damage to property
other than the Project arising out of accidents, either intentional or
negligent, occurring prior to Closing.

  

 E. Sellers liability under Section 12(B)(i) and Section 12(B)(ii) shall not exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate. Further, Seller shall not be required to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 12(B) to the extent the aggregate amount of claims thereunder does not exceed $100,000. The limitations on liability set forth in this Section 12(E) shall not apply to Sellers obligations with respect to the prorations or other post-Closing adjustments required under Section 7(D)

 

  F. Whenever either party shall learn through
the filing of a claim or the commencement of a proceeding or otherwise of the
existence of any liability for which the other party is or may be responsible
under Section 12(B) or 12(C), the party learning of such liability shall
notify the other party promptly and furnish such copies of documents (and make
originals thereof available) and such other information as such party may have
that may be used or useful in the defense of such claims.

 

  G. From and after Closing, the indemnification
provisions in this Section 12 shall be the exclusive remedies of Seller and
Purchaser in connection with any of the matters described in this Section 12,
the transaction described in this Agreement and/or the Project, and each party
hereby waives and releases any other rights or remedies it may have under
applicable law or at equity in connection therewith. The provisions of this
Section 12 shall survive the Closing indefinitely (but shall be subject to
applicable statutes of limitations); provided, however, that the provisions of
Section 12(B)(i) and Section 12(B)(ii) shall be subject to the time
limitations set forth in Section 3(B).

 

  H. If a claim by a third party is made against
any Seller Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party, and if either of
such parties intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under Section
12(B) or Section 12(C), such party shall promptly notify the other party of
such claim. The indemnifying party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt
of the above-referenced notice to notify the indemnified party that it intends
to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing
(subject to the consent of the indemnified party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and at its expense, the settlement or
defense thereof, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate with it
in connection therewith; provided that: (i) the indemnifying party shall
permit the indemnified party    
  

to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by the
indemnified party, provided that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
be borne by the indemnified party, and provided that the indemnifying party
shall control such settlement or defense, except that no such matter shall be
settled without the prior written consent of the indemnified party if the
indemnified party will not be released from all liability in connection with
such matter as part of such settlement; and (ii) the indemnifying party shall
agree promptly to reimburse the indemnified party for the full amount of any
loss resulting from such claim and all related expenses incurred by the
indemnified party within the limits of Section 12(B) or Section 12(C), as the
case may be. As long as the indemnifying party is reasonably contesting any
such claim in good faith, the indemnified party shall not pay or settle any
such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall have
the right to pay or settle any such claim solely with respect to itself,
provided that in such event they shall waive any right to indemnity therefor
by the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party does not notify the
indemnified party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the indemnified
partys notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake
the defense thereof, the indemnified party shall have the right to contest,
settle or compromise the claim in the exercise of its sole discretion at the
expense of the indemnifying party, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Section 12.

 

  SECTION 13. NOTICES. All notices and other
communications which either party is required or desires to send to the other
shall be in writing and shall be sent by messenger, facsimile, reputable
overnight courier or registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested. Notices and other communications shall be deemed to have
been given on the date of actual receipt or refusal thereof. If a notice is
sent by facsimile, a copy of the notice shall be sent by one of the other
methods specified above. Notices shall be addressed as follows:

  or to such other person and/or address as shall be specified by
either party in a notice given to the other pursuant to the provisions of this
Paragraph.

  

 SECTION 14. ATTORNEYS FEES. In the event either party institutes legal proceedings to enforce its rights hereunder, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be paid all reasonable expenses of the litigation by the losing party, including its reasonable attorneys fees. The provisions of this Section 16 shall survive the Closing.

 

  SECTION 15. CONFIDENTIALITY. Except for any
disclosures required by law or the Securities and Exchange Commission,
including, without limitation, Regulation FD, Seller and Purchaser agree to
keep this Agreement confidential and not disclose or make any public
announcements with respect to the subject matter hereof or the existence of
this Agreement without the consent of the other party. If either party desires
to issue a press release or other public announcement regarding the
transaction set forth herein, subject to the immediately preceding sentence,
such party shall obtain the approval of the other party, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the above, prior
consent is not required with respect to disclosure to any individuals or
entities who "need to know" and who are instructed to keep such information
confidential, such as each partys respective officers, directors, employees,
attorneys, accountants, engineers, surveyors, consultants, financiers,
lenders, partners, investors, analysts, potential lessees and bankers, and
such other third parties whose assistance is required in connection with the
consummation of this transaction; provided, such individuals or entities agree
to be bound by the terms of this Section and provided that the party making
such disclosures to such individuals or entities shall be responsible for any
breach of this Section by such individuals or entities. The provisions of this
Section 15 shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement.

 

  SECTION 16. LIKE KIND EXCHANGE. Purchaser agrees to
reasonably cooperate with Seller in effecting an exchange transaction by
Seller which includes the Project pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code,
provided that any exchange initiated by Seller shall be at Sellers sole cost
and expense and shall not delay the Closing.

  

 SECTION 17. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement (including all Exhibits hereto) contains the entire agreement between the parties respecting the matters herein set forth and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties hereto respecting such matters. The section headings shall not be used in construing this Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state where the Project is located. Time is of the essence of this Agreement and each provision hereof. Except as expressly set forth herein, none of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing. The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, changed or modified orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom any amendment,    
  

 change or modification is sought. Any obligation or liability of either of
the parties hereunder shall be enforceable only against, and payable only out
of, the property of such party, and in no event shall any officer, director,
shareholder, partner, member, beneficiary, agent, advisor or employee of
either party be held to any personal liability whatsoever or be liable for any
of the obligations of the parties hereunder. Purchaser shall not record this
Agreement, any memorandum of this Agreement, any assignment of this Agreement
or any other document which would cause a cloud on the title to the Project.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed
to be an original and all of which shall be deemed to be one and the same
instrument. The parties acknowledge that the parties and their counsel have
reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal rule of construction
to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting
party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any
Exhibits or amendments hereto. If any action is required to be performed, or
if any notice, consent or other communication is given, on a day that is a
Saturday or Sunday or a legal holiday in the State of Illinois, such
performance shall be deemed to be required, and such notice, consent or other
communication shall be deemed to be given, on the first business day following
such Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Unless otherwise specified herein, all
references herein to a "day" or "days" shall refer to calendar days and not
business days. ** **PURCHASER AND SELLER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH THEREOF.

  

    SECTION 18. BULK SALES. Seller has
requested (a) a certificate issued by the Illinois Department of Revenue
showing that Seller has no liability for the payment of any assessed but
unpaid tax, penalty or interest under the Illinois Income Tax Act and any
tax, penalty or interest due under the Retailers Occupation Tax Act and (b)
a certificate issued by the City of Chicago Department of Revenues Tax
Division Bulk Sales Unit showing that Seller has no liability for the payment
of any assessed but unpaid tax, penalty or interest under the Uniform Revenue
Procedures Ordinance, Chapter 3-4 and any tax, penalty or interest due under
the ordinance (collectively, the "Tax Certificates"). If Seller receives any
Tax Certificate prior to Closing, Seller shall deposit the amount of taxes
set forth in such Tax Certificates in a joint order escrow with the Title
Company (the "Tax Escrow") at the Closing; and, if Seller receives a Tax
Certificate after Closing, Seller shall deposit the amount of taxes set forth
in such Tax Certificate in the Tax Escrow within five (5) business days after
receipt of the Tax Certificate. The amount in the Tax Escrow shall either be
released to pay such taxes when they come due and payable or released to
Seller upon delivery to Purchaser of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser that Purchaser no longer has any liability for such taxes. Until
the Tax Certificates are obtained and the amount of taxes set forth therein
placed in the Tax Escrow, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, claims, demands, causes of
action, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
court costs and disbursements) which may arise out of Sellers failure to
obtain the Tax Certificates. Such indemnity shall not be subject to the
$5,000,000 cap on Sellers indemnified obligations set forth in Section
12(E) above. Seller shall cause Guarantor to deliver to Purchaser at the
Closing a guaranty of Sellers obligations under this Section 18
(the "Sellers Guaranty") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit U duly
executed by the Guarantor. The provisions of this Section 18 shall survive
the Closing.    
  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
