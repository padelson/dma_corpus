From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing Date, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

    
 1.6 _ Effects of the Merger. _ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the GBCC and the SCBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

    
 1.7 _ Parent Common Stock. _ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities, each share of the common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

  

    
 1.8 _ Conversion of Company Common Stock. _ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities: 

  

  

 (a) Each share of the common stock, par value $3.00 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for any Cancelled Shares (as defined below) and shares of Company Common Stock that are held by shareholders properly exercising their dissenters\' rights pursuant to Sections 14-2-1301 through 14-2-1332 of the GBCC (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.7307 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.8(c), of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), it being understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.7, the Parent Common Stock, including the shares issued to former holders of Company Common Stock as Merger Consideration, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) All shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are owned directly by Parent or the Company (in each case, other than shares of Company Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties and (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Company in respect of a debt previously contracted), shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such cancelled shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ "). 

  

      

  

 (c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution paid, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration to give holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to permit Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event dissenters\' rights are available under Sections 14-2-1301 through 14-2-1332 of the GBCC in connection with the Merger, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 1.8(a), but shall be cancelled and the holders thereof shall thereafter have only such rights as are granted to dissenting shareholders under Sections 14-2-1301 through 14-2-1332 of the GBCC; _provided, however_ , that if any such shareholder fails to perfect his or her rights as a dissenting shareholder with respect to his or her Dissenting Shares in accordance with and as contemplated by Sections 14-2-1301 through 14-2-1332 of the GBCC or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such holder\'s dissenters\' rights, such shares of Company Common Stock held by such shareholder shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of Company Common Stock had been converted into, and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(a), without any interest thereon. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of each shareholder who asserts rights as a dissenting shareholder following receipt of such shareholder\'s written notice of intent to demand payment delivered as provided in Sections 14-2-1321 of the GBCC. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or commit or agree to make any payment, or settle or commit or offer to settle, any rights of a dissenting shareholder asserted under Sections 14-2-1301 through 14-2-1332 of the GBCC. 

  

  

    
 1.9 _ Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.  

  

  

 (a) _ Company Options._ At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than fifteen (15) calendar days) following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration (as defined below) over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any Company Option with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the Cash Consideration shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on the part of the holder thereof and without any payment to the holder thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Cash Consideration_ " shall mean the product determined by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the Parent Share Value. 

   

 (b) _ Company Restricted Stock Awards._ At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to receive, as promptly as 

  

      

  

practicable (but no later than fifteen (15) calendar days) following the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration (without interest and less applicable
withholding Taxes) in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Restricted Stock Award.

  

 (c) _ Corporate Actions._ Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for the treatment of the Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards (either such award, a " _Company Equity Award_ ") contemplated by this Section 1.9.

 1.10 _ Bank Merger. _ Immediately following the Effective Time, Georgia Bank and Trust Company of Augusta, a Georgia-chartered commercial bank and a direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (" _Georgia Bank and Trust_"), will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and into South State Bank, a South Carolina banking corporation and a direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Bank_ "). Parent Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Georgia Bank and Trust shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately after the Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, in a form to be specified by Parent in consultation with the Company (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). In order to obtain the necessary Regulatory Approvals for the Bank Merger, the parties hereto shall cause the following to be accomplished prior to the filing of applications for such Regulatory Approvals: (x) the Company shall cause the board of directors of Georgia Bank and Trust to approve the Bank Merger Agreement; the Company, as the sole shareholder of Georgia Bank and Trust, shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement; and the Company shall cause Georgia Bank and Trust to duly execute and deliver to Parent the Bank Merger Agreement; and (y) Parent shall cause the board of directors of Parent Bank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement; Parent, as the sole shareholder of Parent Bank, shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement; and Parent shall cause Parent Bank to duly execute and deliver to the Company the Bank Merger Agreement.

ARTICLE II 
DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION 

  

    2.1 _ Deposit of Merger Consideration. _ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a
bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement entered into
prior to the Closing (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), for the benefit of
the holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, for exchange in accordance with
this Article II, (a) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to
deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (b) to the extent then
determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(f) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash described in the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto (after giving effect to Section 6.14), the " _Exchange
Fund_ "), and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the
Merger Consideration.

  

    
 2.2 _ Delivery of Merger Consideration_.  

  

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Holder_ " and, collectively, the " _Holders_ ") of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and uncertificated shares of Common Company Stock represented by book-entry 

  

      

  

form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) shall pass only upon
delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s)) or transfer of such Book-Entry Share(s) to the Exchange Agent
and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as
shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent and Parent) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s)
or Book-Entry Share(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of a fractional share and any dividends or distributions to which such
Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

  

 (b) Upon proper surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or transfer of its Book-Entry Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s), as applicable. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of a fractional share upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II. 

   

 (c) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or untransferred Book-Entry Share until the Holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate or transfer such Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or transfer of such Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II, the Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share have been converted into the right to receive and not paid. 

  

 (d) If the Merger Consideration is to be delivered in exchange for a Certificate representing Company Common Stock to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition to such exchange that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered Holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any portion of the Merger Consideration such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be. 

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of a fractional share and any dividends or distributions to which 

  

      

  

such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article II.

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each Holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Share Value by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.8. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. 

  

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the Holders of Company Common Stock as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation. Any former Holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such Holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

  

 (h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of a fractional share, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). 

  

 (i) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of any Letter of Transmittal and compliance by any Holder of Company Common Stock with the procedures and instructions set forth herein and therein, (ii) the issuance and delivery of the whole number of shares of the Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iii) the method of payment of the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 Except as (a) disclosed in writing in the correspondingly enumerated section or subsection of the disclosure schedule of the Company delivered herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedules_ ") ( _provided_ that each exception set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to qualify any other representation and warranty to the extent that the relevance of such exception to such other representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference)) or (b) disclosed in any Company SEC Documents publicly filed prior to the date hereof (but excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factors," "forward-looking statements" or "market risk" sections or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 

   

    
 3.1 _ Corporate Organization_.  

  

  

 (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Georgia and is a bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (" _BHC Act_ ") that has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. The deposit accounts of Georgia Bank and Trust are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Georgia Bank and Trust is a member in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and owns the requisite amount of stock therein. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. True and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the " _Company Articles of Incorporation_ "), and the Bylaws of the Company, as amended (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and the articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each Company Subsidiary, in each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been furnished or made available to Parent. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Articles of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws or such articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of such Company Subsidiary, as applicable.

respect thereto. Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries and as
set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Company
does not as of the date of this Agreement own, directly or indirectly, any

 6.5 _ Employee Benefit Matters_.  

  

  

 (a) From the Closing Date through the first anniversary thereof (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause to be provided employee benefits for the employees (as a group) who are actively employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and continue to be actively employed after the Effective Time (" _Covered Employees_ ") that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ that, until such time as Parent shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the employee benefit plans that are made available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), a Covered Employee\'s continued participation in the employee benefit plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in any different Parent plans may commence at different times). For the avoidance of doubt, during the Continuation Period, each Covered Employee shall, subject to meeting the applicable eligibility requirements, be eligible to receive benefits upon qualifying terminations of employment that are consistent with the terms of Parent\'s standard severance policy for its employees (the " _Severance Policy_ ") (and not pursuant to the terms of any severance plan or policy maintained by the Company); _provided,_ _however_ , that any Covered Employees who are eligible to receive severance benefits, change in control benefits or any enhanced payments pursuant to any individual employment arrangement, change in control arrangement or deferred compensation plan shall not be eligible to receive severance benefits under the Severance Policy. 

  

 (b) Parent shall assume and honor the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under all employment, severance, consulting, retirement and other compensation Contracts in accordance with their terms, except to the extent such Contract is superseded or modified by an agreement with Parent or supplemented by a plan or policy maintained by Parent (including the Severance Policy), _provided_ that nothing herein shall prohibit Parent from amending, suspending or terminating any such Contract to the extent permitted by its terms and applicable Law. Parent hereby acknowledges that the Merger will constitute a "Change in Control" (or concept of similar import) in accordance with the provisions of such Company Benefit Plans. 

  

 (c) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such employee benefit plan to recognize the service of such Covered Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, participation and vesting under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same 

  

      

  

extent that such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective
Time under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that such recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate
any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of
service, (ii) apply for any purpose under any incentive plan, retiree medical
plan or defined benefit pension plan or (iii) apply for purposes of any
plan, program or arrangement (A) under which similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (B)
that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any health care plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) in which any
Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause any preexisting condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary
plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent that
such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) recognize any health care expenses incurred by such
Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the
year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  

 (d) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the board of directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Company\'s 401(k) plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Parent\'s 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the Covered Employees who are actively employed as of the date immediately following the receipt of a favorable determination letter to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, but not inclusive of loans), in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account balance (excluding loans) distributed to such Covered Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan. 

  

 (e) From and after the date hereof, any written or oral communications to the employees, officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters after the Closing or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be, in providing mutually agreeable communications, prepared in prior consultation with Parent, it being agreed that Parent and the Company shall cooperate, including by providing Parent a reasonable period of time to review any such communication, in providing mutually agreeable communications. 

  

 (f) Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.5 or Section 9.11, the provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries 

  

      

  

(including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) to
amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, employment agreement or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee,
officer, director or independent contractor any right to employment or
continued employment or continued service with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with
any employee.

If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Parent\'s sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent. 

   

 (b) Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger and the Bank Merger (including by providing for the merger of the Company with a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent), and the Company agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; _provided,_ _however_ , that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount, kind or timing of receipt of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to the Company\'s shareholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be prevented or materially delayed or the receipt of the Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed.

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative or investigation (each, a " _Claim_ "), in which a Company Indemnified Party is, was or is threatened to be made a party or witness, or arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The Surviving Corporation shall pay reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) in advance of the final disposition of any such proceeding to each Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable state or federal Law upon receipt of an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such advance payments if he or she shall be adjudicated to be not entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.7(a). 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (b) Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.7(a), upon learning of any Claim, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation thereof. In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Company Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Company Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Company Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Company Indemnified Parties, the Company Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Company Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.7(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Company Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction; (ii) the Company Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Claim; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Company Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Company Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. 

  

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts (and the Company shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time the currently existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous or (ii) with the prior written consent of the Company given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium payment on the Company\'s current policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement and, if the Surviving Corporation is unable to maintain such policy (or substitute policy) as a result of this proviso, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time by payment of such amount; _provided, further_ , that (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor a six (6)-year "tail" prepaid policy the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than the Company\'s existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_  that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the " _Maximum Amount_ ", as set forth on Section 6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, for such "tail" policy and _provided, further_ , that if the aggregate amount necessary to procure or maintain such "tail" policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this Section 6.7(c) so long as it uses its reasonable best efforts to obtain the most advantageous (in terms of both duration and coverage) "tail" prepaid policy obtainable for an aggregate amount equal to the Maximum Amount or (ii) the Company, with Parent\'s prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), may obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the Company\'s existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time). 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and representatives. 

  

       

    
 6.8 _ Exchange Listing. _ Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance, and Parent shall give all notices and make all filings with the NASDAQ required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. 

  

    
 6.9 _ No Solicitation. _ 

  

  

 (a) The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and cause its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other retained representatives (each, a " _Representative_ "), not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of tender offer), business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (as defined below) (any of the foregoing inquiries, proposals or offers being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any Person (or Representative of such Person) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, (iii) approve or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other Contract related to any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 (b) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means (i) any transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than Parent or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or outstanding voting power of the Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company and any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of the Company (except, in each case, the Merger and the Bank Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than Parent or its Affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose, the outstanding equity securities of any Company Subsidiaries and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination involving any Company Subsidiary) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than twenty percent (20%) of the fair market value of all the assets, deposits, net revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held the shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the consummation thereof. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors of the Company shall be permitted, prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.9 and to first entering into a confidentiality 

  

      

  

agreement having provisions that are no less favorable to such party than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to engage in discussions and
negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or data to, any
Person in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
by such Person first made after the date of this Agreement (that did not
result from a breach of this Section 6.9) and which the board of directors of
the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal (as defined below), if and only to the extent that the
directors of the Company conclude in good faith (after consultation with
their outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to violate their fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of any nonpublic information or data provided to
any Person pursuant to the prior sentence prior to or simultaneously with
furnishing such information to such Person.

   

 (d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that informs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). The Company shall also promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction or provides nonpublic information or data to any Person in accordance with Section 6.9(c) and keep Parent informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating thereto. 

  

 (e) Except as provided in Section 6.9(f), neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the board of directors of the Company or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve or recommend to its shareholders, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to approve or recommend to its shareholders, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) fail to publicly, finally and without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal, and (B) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case within ten (10) Business Days after such Acquisition Proposal is made public (any of the foregoing clauses (i)(iii), a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ "). 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the board of directors of the Company may make a Change in Company Recommendation if and only if (i) an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.9) is made to the Company by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (ii) the board of directors of the Company has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (iii) the directors of the Company have concluded in good faith (after consultation with their outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iv) prior to effecting the Change in Company Recommendation, five (5) Business Days shall have elapsed since the Company has 

  

      

  

given written notice to Parent advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor,
including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making,
any such Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a "
_Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment
to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the five (5) Business Day
period referred to in this clause (iv) and in clauses (v) and (vi) shall be
reduced to three (3) Business Days following the giving of such new Notice of
Recommendation Change), (v) during such five (5) Business Day period, the
Company has considered and engaged in good-faith discussions with Parent
regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent, and (vi) the board of directors of the Company, following
such five (5) Business Day period, again reasonably determine in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent) that such Acquisition
Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that
failure to take such action would violate their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made by a third Person (or group of Persons acting in concert within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination or acquisition transaction, (i) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (ii) all of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, and which the board of directors of the Company has in good faith determined (taking into account, among other things, (A) its consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors and (B) the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent)), to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company\'s shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account all other legal, financial, timing, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the Person making the proposal. 

   

 (h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall prohibit the Company or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided, however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement, including Section 8.1(f). 

   

 (i) The Company agrees that it (i) will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their Representatives, to cease immediately and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction and (ii) will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction. The Company agrees that it will promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries\' respective Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.9. 

   

 (j) Nothing in this Section 6.9 shall (x) permit the Company to terminate this Agreement or (y) affect any other obligation of the parties under this Agreement. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction other than this Agreement and the Merger prior to the termination of this Agreement. 

  

       

    
 6.10 _ Notification of Certain Matters. _ Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it that (a) has had or is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, changes, events and circumstances known to it, to have or to result in any Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, with respect to it or (b) would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or that could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.10 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied. 

   

    
 6.11 _ Governance Matters. _ 

  

  

 (a) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to be 14. The initial board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time shall include one (1) current member of the board of directors of either the Company or Georgia Bank and Trust as designated by Parent prior to the Effective Time (such director, the " _Company Director_ "). No other directors or employees of the Company shall be designated to serve on the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time. The appointment of the Company Director to the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be subject to the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the Company Director must (i) be reasonably acceptable to the Governance Committee of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) satisfy and comply with the requirements regarding service as a member of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation provided under applicable Law and the practices and policies of such board that are generally applicable to its members.

Horger shall continue to serve as the Chairman of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the officers of Parent in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with such additional persons as may thereafter be elected, shall serve as the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

    
 6.12 _ Advisory Board. _ At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall invite each member of the board of directors of Georgia Bank and Trust as of the date of this Agreement (other than those individuals specified in Section 6.12 of the Parent Disclosure Schedules) to serve as paid members of the Surviving Corporation\'s regional advisory board for the Augusta, Georgia and Aiken, South Carolina regions (the " _Regional Advisory Board_ ") for two (2) years following the Closing. In furtherance of such service, each such director shall enter into an Advisory Board member agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (an " _Advisory Board Member Agreement_ "). 

  

    
 6.13 _ Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). _ The Company and Parent agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.13. The board of directors of Parent and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall promptly, and in any event prior to the 

        

Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to
cause (i) any dispositions of Company Common Stock and (ii) any acquisitions
of Parent Common Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be either an officer or director of the Surviving Corporation
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
in each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  

    
 6.14 _ Dividends. _ After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 

  

    
 6.15 _ Takeover Laws and Provisions. _ No party shall take any action that would cause this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Statute, and each party shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Statute, as now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute. 

  

    
 6.16 _ Shareholder Litigation. _ The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in at its own expense the defense or settlement of any such litigation. No settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company shall be agreed to without Parent\'s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

    
 6.17 _ Company Debt. _ If requested by Parent in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, (i) effect the redemption of the Company\'s and/or its Subsidiaries\' obligations in respect of any outstanding debt securities, Trust Preferred Securities or related guarantees, and (ii) provide any other cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the redemption of such obligations; _provided_ that to the extent that any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, it shall be so conditioned. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, or shall cause their counsel to, furnish legal opinions in customary form and scope relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or as may be required in connection with the matters contemplated by this Section 6.17. In the event that, as of the Effective Time, Parent, together with the Company, has not effectuated the redemption of the Company\'s and/or its Subsidiaries\' obligations in respect of such outstanding debt securities, Trust Preferred Securities or related guarantees, Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption of the Company\'s obligations to the extent required by the terms of such debt security, Trust Preferred Securities or related guarantee. 

       

                                    

    

    
 6.18 _ Restructuring Efforts. _ If either the Company or Parent shall have failed to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, as applicable, at the duly convened Company Shareholders Meeting or Parent Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall (i) in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein and/or (ii) resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.18) to its shareholders for adoption; _provided, however_ , that in the case of clause (i) only, no party shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or change any material term of this Agreement, including the amount, kind or timing of receipt of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement or (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to shareholders of the Company or Parent.

waiver or failure to exercise any right or to insist on strict compliance with
an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other matter.

Exhibit A 

Form of Voting and Support Agreement 

  

 This Voting and Support Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 16, 2016, is entered into by and among South State Corporation, a South Carolina corporation ("Parent"), Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation, a Georgia corporation (the "Company") and [NAME], a shareholder of the Company (the "Shareholder"). 

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended or supplemented, the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and the Company, the Company will be merged with and into Parent, with Parent as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Shareholder beneficially owns the number of shares of common stock, par value $3.00 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") as set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto (the "Existing Shares"); 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement believe that the future success and profitability of Parent and its subsidiaries following the Merger, including without limitation, South State Bank (the "Combined Bank"), requires that the Shareholder be subject to the restrictions set forth herein with respect to his or her specified involvement with a Competing Business (as defined herein) for a period of five years after the closing of the Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Merger, Parent has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Shareholder with certain liquidity opportunities, including by providing certain registration rights as set forth in this Agreement; and 

   

 WHEREAS, as an inducement and a condition to Parent entering into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that the Shareholder, in his or her capacity as a shareholder of the Company, enter into this Agreement. 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agrees as follows: 

  

 

 1.

 _Definitions_. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the meaning assigned to those terms in the Merger Agreement. The following definitions also apply to this Agreement:  

 

 a.

d.

 _Specified Shareholders_. "Specified Shareholders" means, collectively, the individuals executing the Voting and Support Agreements executed on the date hereof in connection with the Merger Agreement.  


 

2.

 _Effectiveness_. This Agreement shall be effective upon signing. If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with its terms, this Agreement (other than _Section 5_ and _Sections 14_ through  _18_ ) shall automatically terminate and be null and void and of no effect. 
 

      

 

 3.

 _Participation in Competing Business_. Except as provided in _Section 6_ and _Section 7_, during the Term, the Shareholder shall not become involved with a Competing Business within the Covered Area or serve, directly or indirectly, a Competing Business within the Covered Area in any manner, including without limitation as a shareholder, member, partner, director, officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, employee, advisor, consultant, agent, or representative, or otherwise becoming involved in any manner in the organization, pre-opening phases, or the formation of such Competing Business; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth herein shall not prevent the Shareholder from using services of any Competing Business within the Covered Area that are generally available to the public.

6.

 _Outside Covered Area; Requests for Waivers or Permission_. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the Shareholder from becoming involved with, as a shareholder, member, partner, director, officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, employee, consultant, agent, representative, or otherwise, with a Competing Business that has no operations in the Covered Area. Prior to engaging in any manner in a Competing Business that has operations in the Covered Area, the Shareholder may request in writing that Parent waive the restrictions set forth in this Agreement with respect to a particular proposed activity. If Parent determines, in its sole discretion, that such activity is acceptable, Parent shall provide Shareholder with a written consent to engage in such activity, and such activity shall thereafter not be deemed a Competing Business.  


7.

 _Passive Interest_. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the Shareholder from passively owning, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate (including without limitation by being a member of a group within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act (as defined below)) (a) 1% or less of any class of security of a Competing Business _or_ (b) securities of any Competing Business that has a class of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
 

      

 

 8.

 _Reasonableness of Restrictions_. The Shareholder acknowledges and represents that the covenants set forth above represent only a limited restraint and allow the Shareholder to pursue his or her occupation without unreasonable or unfair restrictions. The Shareholder acknowledges that the limitations of length of time, geography and scope of activity agreed to in this Agreement are reasonable because, among other things: (a) the Company and Parent are engaged in a highly competitive industry, (b) the Shareholder has had unique access to the trade secrets and know-how of the Company and Parent, including the plans and strategy (and, in particular, the competitive strategy) of the Combined Bank, (c) the Shareholder will receive the benefit of a substantial premium for the Shareholder\'s Shares in the Merger, and will have a shared interest with Parent, as a continuing shareholder of Parent, in preserving the benefits to Parent of the Merger for which Parent will have paid good and valuable consideration as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (d) this Agreement provides no more protection than is necessary to protect Parent\'s interests in the Company\'s goodwill, trade secrets and confidential information.  


9.

 _Voting Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (a) the Closing Date and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (the "Support Period"), the Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally hereby agrees, that at any meeting (whether annual or special and each adjourned or postponed meeting) of the Company\'s shareholders, however called, or in connection with any written consent of the Company\'s shareholders, the Shareholder shall (i) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all of his or her Existing Shares and other shares of Common Stock over which he or she has acquired beneficial ownership after the date hereof (including any shares of Common Stock acquired by means of purchase, dividend or distribution, or issued upon the exercise of any stock options to acquire Common Stock or warrants or the conversion of any convertible securities or otherwise) (collectively, the "New Shares" and, together with the Existing Shares, the "Shares"), which he or she owns or controls as of the applicable record date, to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum and (ii) vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) all such Shares (A) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (B) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting of the Company\'s shareholders to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement, (C) against any action or proposal in favor of an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, without regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, and (D) against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be likely to (1) result in a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, or of the Shareholder contained in this Agreement, or (2) prevent, materially impede or materially delay the Company\'s or Parent\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ , that the foregoing applies solely to Shareholder in his or her capacity as a shareholder or as a trustee or a limited general partner in any entity holding Shares, and, to the extent the Shareholder serves as a member of the board of directors or officer of the Company, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the Shareholder in Shareholder\'s capacity as such a director or officer, including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or shall be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict Shareholder from exercising Shareholder\'s fiduciary duties as a director or officer to the Company or its shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments apply to any Shares held by any trust, limited partnership or other entity holding Shares for which the Shareholder serves in any partner, shareholder or trustee capacity. To the extent the Shareholder does not control, by himself or 
 

      

   

herself, the determinations of such shareholder entity, the Shareholder
agrees to exercise all voting or other determination rights he or she has in
such shareholder entity to carry out the intents and purposes of his or her
support and voting obligations in this paragraph and otherwise set forth in
this Agreement. The Shareholder covenants and agrees that, except for this
Agreement, he or she (x) has not entered into, and shall not enter during the
Support Period, any voting agreement or voting trust with respect to the
Shares and (y) has not granted, and shall not grant during the Support
Period, a proxy, consent or power of attorney with respect to the Shares
except any proxy to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

   

 10.

 _Transfer Restrictions prior to Merger_. The Shareholder hereby agrees that he or she will not, during the Support Period, sell, transfer, assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or similarly dispose of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise), either voluntarily or involuntarily, enter into any swap or other arrangements that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of, enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, lien, hypothecation or other disposition of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise convey or dispose of, any of the Shares, or any interest therein, including the right to vote any Shares, as applicable (a "Transfer"); provided that the Shareholder may Transfer Shares for estate planning or philanthropic purposes so long as the transferee, prior to the date of Transfer, agrees in a signed writing to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement or upon the death of the Shareholder.  


11.

 _Registration Rights_. During the Term, Parent agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the liquidity of the shares of common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of Parent held (directly or through a trust or partnership) by the Shareholder (until sold as contemplated hereunder or otherwise sold by the relevant Shareholder, the "Registrable Securities"), including by using commercially reasonable efforts to comply with its filing obligations under the Exchange Act and to ensure that Parent remains eligible for the use of a "shelf" registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form), which would permit the registration and sale of the Registrable Securities on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder (the "Securities Act"). During the Term, the Specified Shareholders (acting through Ronald L. Thigpen) may make one or more written requests (each, a "Demand Registration Request") to Parent for registration under and in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act, of all or part of their Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the value of the Registrable Securities being requested to be registered with respect to any such Demand Registration Request shall be no less than twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), (b) the Specified Shareholders may make no more than two (2) Demand Registration Requests and (c) only one (1) Demand Registration Request may be made by the Specified Shareholders in any rolling twelve (12)-month period. All Demand Registration Requests made pursuant to this Section 11 will specify the aggregate number of Registrable Securities to be registered and will also specify the intended methods of disposition thereof. Subject to the following sentence, promptly upon receipt of any such Demand Registration Request, Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such registration under the Securities Act of the Registrable Securities which Parent has been so requested to register within ninety (90) days of such request (or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Parent shall have the right to delay acting on any Demand Registration Request to take into account any customary quarterly blackout periods, and (ii) if, following the receipt of a Demand Registration Request, Parent determines in good faith that it would be inadvisable or adverse to Parent or its shareholders for a registration statement to be filed on or before the date such filing would 
 

      

   

otherwise be required pursuant to this Section 11, or if Parent determines in
good faith that such filing would be reasonably likely to require the
disclosure of non-public material information, the disclosure of which would
be reasonably likely to be inadvisable or adverse to Parent, then Parent shall
have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than one
hundred twenty (120) days after the date such filing would otherwise be
required hereunder. The Shareholder agrees that, in the event any of the
conditions set forth in the preceding sentence apply following the filing of
a registration statement and during an ongoing offering, Parent may suspend
the registration statement as reasonably necessary and may require the
Specified Shareholders to suspend offers and sales under the registered
offering, in each case for a period of not more than one hundred twenty (120)
days. If and to the extent Parent is required to use commercially reasonable
efforts to effect the registration of the Registrable Shares pursuant to this
Section 11, Parent also agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Specified
Shareholders to facilitate the execution and completion of such registered
offering, including by taking customary actions required for a registrant to
complete a secondary sale by selling shareholders. In connection with
any underwritten offering as contemplated hereunder, the selection of the
underwriter shall be at Parent\'s discretion. The customary costs to Parent
of effecting of any underwritten offering resulting from any Demand
Registration Request shall be borne by Parent, except, for the avoidance
of doubt, that the Specified Shareholders participating in the offering shall
bear all underwriting discounts, sales commissions, brokerage fees or similar
charges of the underwriter or sales agent and shall bear the fees and
expenses, if any, of their counsel or other advisors they may engage.

   

 12.

 _Representations of the Shareholder_. The Shareholder represents and warrants to Parent as follows: (a) the Shareholder has full legal right, capacity and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform the Shareholder\'s obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms, and no other action is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Shareholder or the performance of his or her obligations hereunder; (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with or violate any Laws or agreement binding upon the Shareholder or the Existing Shares, nor require any authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity, (d) as of the date hereof, the Shareholder beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) the Existing Shares, (e) as of the date hereof, the Shareholder beneficially owns the Existing Shares free and clear of any proxy, voting restriction, adverse claim or other Lien (other than any restrictions created by this Agreement, under applicable federal or state securities laws or pursuant to any written policies of the Company with respect to the trading of securities in connection with insider trading restrictions, applicable securities laws and similar considerations or as disclosed in the Company\'s proxy statement for its 2016 annual meeting of shareholders).  


13.

 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement is irrevocable. The recitals are incorporated as a part of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise and shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights under this Agreement are assignable by Parent to a majority-owned affiliate or any 
 

      

   

successor-in-interest of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent
of its obligations hereunder.

   

 14.

 _Remedies/Specific Enforcement_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its terms and that Parent would be irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with its specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled (including monetary damages), Parent shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof. The Shareholder further agrees that neither Parent nor any other person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this paragraph, and the Shareholder irrevocably waives any right he or she may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.  


15.

 _Governing Law and Enforceability_. This Agreement is governed by, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to any applicable conflict of law principles. If any court determines that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are unenforceable, then the parties request such court to reform these provisions to the maximum restrictions, term, scope or geographical area that such court finds enforceable. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) submits to the personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, or in the event (but only in the event) that such United States District Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such dispute, any Georgia state court sitting in Fulton County, Georgia, in the event any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that he or she or it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (c) agrees that he or she or it will not bring any claim, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, or in the event (but only in the event) that such United States District Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such claim, action or proceeding, any Georgia state court sitting in Fulton County, Georgia.  


16.

 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to any Person or circumstance is unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the court construing this Agreement shall add as a part of this Agreement, a provision as similar in terms and effect to such unenforceable provision as may be enforceable, in lieu of the unenforceable provision.  


17.

 _Amendments; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed (a) in the case of an amendment, by Parent and the Shareholder, and (b) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

WITNESSETH: 

  

 WHEREAS, the Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation (together, as applicable, with its subsidiaries and affiliates referred to herein as " _SBFC_ "), dated as of June 16, 2016 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which SBFC shall merge with and into the Company effective as of the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement); 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company and SBFC have determined that it is in the best interests of the Company, SBFC and the Company\'s and SBFC\'s shareholders to establish an advisory board consisting of certain legacy directors of SBFC, together with additional individuals, if any, appointed by the Company in its sole discretion (the " _Advisory Board_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Member has invaluable knowledge and expertise regarding the business of SBFC, and the Company wishes to appoint the Member to serve on the Advisory Board on the terms and subject to the conditions specified hereinafter. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Member hereby agree as follows:

 2. _ Advisory Services. _ During the Advisory Period, the Member shall (a) attend Advisory Board meetings, (b) make himself or herself reasonably available to the Company to discuss matters relating to the business of its banking interests in certain markets served by SBFC as of the Closing Date (the " _SBFC Markets_ "), and (c) advise on specific projects for the Company relating to business opportunities in the SBFC Markets, in each case, as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Company. 

   

    
 3. _ Consideration. _ In consideration for agreeing to provide the advisory services set forth in Section 2 and in consideration of the Member\'s compliance with the Restrictive Covenants set forth in Section 7, the Member shall be paid an advisory fee of $10,000 annually, to be paid on a quarterly basis, in arrears (the " _Advisory Fee_ ").

 6. _ Status as an Independent Contractor. _ The Company and the Member acknowledge and agree that the Member shall be acting and shall act at all times as an independent contractor only and not as an employee, agent, partner or joint venturer of or with the Company or any entity for which the Company provides services. The Member acknowledges that he is solely responsible for the payment of all Federal, state, local and foreign taxes that are required by applicable laws or regulations to be paid hereunder (including, without limitation, the Advisory Fees). 

  

    
 7. _ Restrictive Covenants. _ 

  

 (a) Restrictive Covenants. The Member shall not take any of the following actions during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Effective Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "). 

  

  

 (i) Become involved with a Competing Business within the Covered Area or serve, directly or indirectly, a Competing Business within the Covered Area in any manner, including without limitation as a shareholder, member, partner, director, officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, employee, advisor, consultant, agent, or representative, or otherwise becoming involved in any manner in the organization, pre-opening phases, or the formation of such Competing Business; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth herein shall not prevent the Member from using services of any Competing Business within the Covered Area that are generally available to the public; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Member from becoming involved with, as a shareholder, member, partner, director, officer, manager, investor, organizer, founder, employee, consultant, agent, representative, or otherwise, with a Competing Business that has no operations in the Covered Area and nothing shall prevent the Member from passively owning, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate (including without limitation by being a member of a group within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act (as defined below)) 1% or less of any class of security of a Competing Business _or_ securities of any Competing Business that has a class of securities registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "); 

   

 (ii) Solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to solicit, divert or take away, or in association with any other person, solicit, divert or take away or attempt to solicit, divert or takeaway, for competitive purposes, the business of any of the clients or customers of the Company, South State Bank, or an affiliate thereof (including, without limitation, SBFC and its affiliates) (collectively " _Company Affiliates_ "), or otherwise induce such customers or clients or prospective customers or clients to reduce, terminate, restrict or alter their business relationship with the Company or any Company Affiliate in any fashion, including, without limitation, customers or prospective customers to refrain from maintaining or acquiring from or through the Company or any Company Affiliate any product or service which was provided or offered by the Company during the period of the Member\'s service with the Company; or 

  

 (iii) Solicit, induce or attempt to solicit or induce, or in association with any other person, solicit or induce or attempt to solicit or induce, any employee of the Company or any Company Affiliate (or individual who was an employee of the Company or any Company Affiliate within the year preceding such solicitation) to leave the Company or any Company Affiliate for the purpose of engaging in a business operation that is competitive with the Company or Company Affiliate or is or would be a Competing Party. 

  

  

 (b) Competing Business and Covered Area. For purposes of Section 7(a)(i) of this Agreement, the term "Competing Business" shall mean any depository, wealth management, commercial and/or consumer lending or trust business company or holding company thereof (including without limitation, any start-up bank or bank in formation) and the term "Covered Area" shall mean the States of Georgia and South Carolina. 

        

 (c) Member\'s Representation. The Member acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions of this Section 7 are necessary and vital to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company and its Affiliates, are fair and reasonable in all respects, and are not overbroad or unduly burdensome to him or her. If a court determines that this Agreement or any covenant contained herein is unreasonable, void or unenforceable, for any reason whatsoever, then in such event the parties hereto agree that the duration, geographical or other limitation imposed herein should be such as the court determines to be fair and reasonable; it being the intent of each of the parties hereto be subject to an agreement that is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interest of the Company and/or Company Affiliate and its successors or assigns and that is not unduly harsh in curtailing the legitimate rights of the Member. 

  

 (d) Remedies. The Member acknowledges that a breach of any covenants or agreements contained herein will cause the Company and the Company Affiliates to sustain irreparable damages for which they would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore the Member agrees that in the event of any such breach, in addition to the cessation of the Company\'s obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief, in addition to any other remedy to which the Company may be entitled, at law or in equity. It is accordingly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages, in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction. The Member hereby waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 

   

 (e) Obligations Survive. The Member\'s obligations under this Section 7 shall survive any early termination of the Advisory Period with the Company. 

  

    
 8. _ Termination of Arrangement. _ The parties hereto expect that this advisory arrangement will continue for the full term of the Advisory Period, but either the Member or the Company may choose to terminate the Advisory Period for any reason prior to the end of the scheduled Advisory Period upon written notice provided to the other party hereto. The parties hereto acknowledge that, regardless of the reason for any such termination, the Member shall continue to receive Advisory Fees through the second anniversary of the Effective Date, and the parties further agree and acknowledge that the Restricted Period shall continue to apply to the Member for the Restricted Period (as defined in Section 7) irrespective of any earlier termination of the Advisory Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that in addition to any other remedy that the Company may seek, the Company shall cease to pay Advisory Fees to the Member upon any breach of Section 7(a) hereof. 

  

    
 9. _ Miscellaneous. _ 

   

 (a) Successors and Assigns.

In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) submits to the personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, or in the event (but only in the event) that such United States District

proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any court other than the United States District Court for the District of
South Carolina sitting in Richland County, South Carolina, or in the event
(but only in the event) that such United States District Court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction over such claim, action or proceeding, in any
South Carolina state court sitting in Richland County, South Carolina. Each
party agrees that service of process upon such party in any such claim,
action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement.

 (f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 (g) Severability. If any provision contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. 

  

    
 10. _ Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. _ 

  

 (a) General. This Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in a manner so that any amount or benefit payable hereunder shall be paid or provided in a manner that is either exempt from or compliant with the requirements Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance and Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (and any applicable transition relief under Section 409A of the Code). Nevertheless, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Company nor its directors, officers, employees or advisers (other than the Member) shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by the Member as a result of the application of Section 409A of the Code. 

        

 (b) Definitional Restrictions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any amount or benefit that would constitute non-exempt "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code (" _Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation_ ") would otherwise be payable or distributable hereunder by reason of the Member\'s termination of service, such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation will not be payable or distributable to the Member unless the circumstances giving rise to such termination of service meet any description or definition of "separation from service" in Section 409A of the Code and applicable regulations (without giving effect to any elective provisions that may be available under such definition). This provision does not prohibit the _vesting_ of any Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation upon a termination of service, however defined. If this provision prevents the payment or distribution of any Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation, such payment shall be made on the date on which an event occurs that constitutes a Section 409A-compliant "separation from service." In no event may the Member, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment under this Agreement, and to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code.
