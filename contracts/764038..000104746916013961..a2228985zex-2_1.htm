the U.S. Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit Plan within the past three (3)&nbsp;years, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any Knowledge of any material plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such program. </FONT></P>

required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of the Company. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Company Benefit Plan that is in any part&nbsp;a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code (i)&nbsp;complies and, at
all times after December&nbsp;31, 2008 has complied, both in form and operation, with the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and the final regulations and other applicable guidance
thereunder and (ii)&nbsp;between January&nbsp;1, 2005 and December&nbsp;31, 2008 was operated in good faith compliance with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, as determined under applicable
guidance of the Treasury and the IRS. No compensation payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary has been reportable as nonqualified deferred compensation in the gross income of any individual
or entity, and subject to an additional tax, as a result of the operation of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. No assets set aside for the payment of benefits under any "nonqualified deferred

each Qualified Plan, and the related trust has not been revoked, and there are no existing circumstances, and no events have occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any Qualified Plan or the related trust. Except as set forth on Section&nbsp;3.11(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, no trust funding any Company Benefit Plan is intended to

dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and the Company, the Company will be merged with and into Parent, with Parent as the surviving corporation (the

the parties to this Agreement believe that the future success and profitability of Parent and its subsidiaries following the Merger, including without limitation, South State
