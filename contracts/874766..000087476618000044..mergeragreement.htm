This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of August 22,
2018, by and among THE NAVIGATORS GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation (the

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), Parent
(the "Parent Board") and Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Board") (a) have each
unanimously approved the business combination transaction provided for herein
in which Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such
merger (the "Merger"), so that immediately following the Merger, the Company
will be a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, (b) have each determined
that the terms of this Agreement are in the best interests of and fair to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub and their respective stockholders, as
applicable, and (c) have declared the advisability of this Agreement and the

WHEREAS the Company Board has unanimously recommended the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of Company Shares;

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain holders of Company Shares (such
stockholders, together with their Affiliates, the "Existing Stockholder
Group") are entering into an agreement (the "Voting Agreement"), pursuant to
which such stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Voting Agreement, to vote or cause to be voted any Company Shares
beneficially owned by them in favor of adopting this Agreement and any other
actions contemplated hereby in respect of which approval of holders of Company
Shares is requested; and

WHEREAS the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.01 Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Company"). The Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are referred to herein as the "Transactions".

Section 1.02 Merger Effective Time. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, before the Closing, the Company shall prepare,
and on the Closing Date the 

Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the
"Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

Section 1.03 Effects of Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 259 of the
DGCL.

Section 1.04 Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Company. At the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form
of Exhibit A, and, as so amended, such certificate of incorporation shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company and (b) the by-laws
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the by-laws of the Surviving Company (in each case until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or pursuant to applicable Law and subject to
Section 5.08).

Section 1.05 Board of Directors and Officers of Surviving Company. The
directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case
may be.

Section 1.06 Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY
10019 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the Company and
Parent, which date shall be as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any
event no later than the fifth (5th) business day) following the satisfaction
or (to the extent permitted herein and by applicable Law) waiver by the party
or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted herein and by applicable Law) waiver of those conditions at such
time), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed to in writing
by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

ARTICLE II 

EFFECT ON THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; PAYMENT OF
CONSIDERATION

Section 2.01 Effect of Merger on the Share Capital of Merger Sub and the
Company. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Merger, and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
holder of any common stock, par value $0.10 

per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") or any shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Conversion of Share Capital of Merger Sub. Each share of capital stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Company.

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and be
outstanding and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Conversion of Company Shares. Subject to Section 2.01(b) and Section 2.05,
each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Shares") shall automatically as a
result of the Merger be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to $70.00, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). Subject to
Section 2.05, as of the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced any Company Shares (each, a
"Certificate") or uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Book-Entry Share") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pertaining to the Company Shares represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, to be paid in consideration
therefor, in accordance with Section 2.02(b) and the right to receive
dividends and other distributions in accordance with this ARTICLE II, in each
case without interest.

Section 2.02 Exchange Fund.

(a) Paying Agent. Not less than three (3) business days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for
the payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Company Shares in accordance with this ARTICLE II and, in
connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent
prior to the Closing Date in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited an
amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount payable to holders of
Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.01(c) with the Paying Agent (such cash,
and the cash referred to in the immediately following sentence, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). From time to time as
necessary, Parent shall promptly deposit with the Paying Agent additional cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions payable to holders of
Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f). Pending its disbursement in
accordance with this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the
highest quality by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase 

agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5 billion. Any and all interest earned on the Exchange Fund shall be paid by
the Paying Agent to Parent. Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash
in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments to
former holders of Company Shares of the Merger Consideration and any dividends
and other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(f). No investment
losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent
shall diminish the rights of any former holder of Company Shares to receive
the Merger Consideration or any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(f) pertaining thereto as provided herein. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment to
holders of Company Shares of the Merger Consideration and of any dividends and
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(f).

(b) Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Company Shares. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) business days
after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such other
customary provisions as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to the
Company's reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to the Effective Time)),
together with instructions thereto, setting forth, inter alia, the procedures
by which holders of Certificates may receive the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to this
ARTICLE II. Holders of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate but shall, if required by the Paying Agent, be required to deliver
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the
Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to pursuant to this ARTICLE II.
Upon the completion of such applicable procedures by a holder and the
surrender of such holder's Certificates, and, except as contemplated by the
previous sentence, without any action by any holder of record of Book-Entry
Shares, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such holder (other than any holder
of Company Shares representing Appraisal Shares), (i) in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger and (ii) cash in an
amount (subject to Section 2.02(g)) equal to the number of Company Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that
(A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Company that any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder either
has been paid or is not applicable. Until satisfaction of the applicable
procedures contemplated by this Section 2.02 and subject to Section 2.05, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to Company Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as contemplated by Section
2.02(f). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable with
respect to Company Shares pursuant to this ARTICLE II. 

(c) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Appraisal Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Company shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions to be paid in respect of Company Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate as contemplated by this ARTICLE II.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the one hundred and
eightieth (180th) day after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had
been delivered to the Paying Agent and which has not been disbursed to former
holders of Company Shares, and thereafter such former holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for, and Parent and
the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claims of the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to
their former Company Shares that such former holders have the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for the Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of each Company Share in accordance with the
terms of this ARTICLE II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to
(i) Section 2.05 and (ii) the Surviving Company's obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that have been declared by the Company on Company Shares not in
violation of the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, the share transfer books of the Surviving Company shall be updated to
reflect the transfer of Company Shares to Parent in accordance with the terms
herein. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares
formerly represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
underlying Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(d), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this ARTICLE II. 

(g) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or under any provision of other applicable Tax Law. To the extent amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 2.03 Company Equity Awards.

(a) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units and Performance Units. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any duly authorized
committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to provide that,
effective immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time:



(i) Each performance unit award granted prior to January 1, 2017, and each
tranche of a restricted stock unit award that vests prior to January 1, 2020,
that was granted under the Company Stock Plan prior to January 1, 2019, and
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is payable in
Company Shares (together, the "2019 Vesting Company Awards") shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of
restricted stock units in the applicable tranche or, in the case of
performance units, the target number of Company Shares, in each case subject
to the 2019 Vesting Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(ii) Each performance unit award granted on or after January 1, 2017, and
prior to January 1, 2019, and each tranche of a restricted stock unit award
that vests on or after January 1, 2020, but that was granted prior to January
1, 2019, that was granted under the Company Stock Plan and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is payable in Company Shares
(together, the "2020 Vesting Company Awards") shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the
Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of restricted stock units in
the applicable tranche or, in the case of performance units, the target number
of Company Shares, in each case subject to the 2020 Vesting Company Awards
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that such right to a cash
payment shall be subject to the same vesting and payment schedules as the 2020
Vesting Company Award it replaces (other than performance-based vesting
conditions).



(iii) Each performance unit award granted on or after January 1, 2019, and
each restricted stock unit award granted on or after January 1, 2019, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is payable in Company
Shares (together, the "2019 New Company Awards"), shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive a number of restricted stock units issued
pursuant to The Hartford 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (each, a "Parent RSU") in
respect of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of 

Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to (A) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of restricted stock units in the applicable tranche
or, in the case of performance units, the target number of Company Shares, in
each case subject to the 2019 New Company Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, divided by (B) the closing price of a share of Parent Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day immediately prior to
the Closing Date; provided, that each Parent RSU shall be subject to the same
vesting and payment schedules as the 2019 New Company Award it replaces (other
than performance-based vesting conditions).



(iv) Each performance unit award and restricted stock unit award that was
granted under the Company Stock Plan and that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and is payable in cash (together, the "Cash Awards")
shall be settled in accordance with its terms.



(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto shall collaborate to
determine a method to convert and/or settle, as applicable Company Awards held
by a Company Employee based outside the United States in a manner that is
consistent with the Company Stock Plan and designed to preserve the intended
economic treatment and ameliorate issues (if any) posed by applicable Law.



(b) Treatment of Restricted Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any duly authorized committee thereof administering
the Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as may be required to provide that, effective immediately prior to or
upon the Effective Time, any restrictions on any restricted Company Share
granted under the Company Stock Plan (the "Company Restricted Shares") shall
lapse.

(c) Termination of the Company Stock Plan. As of the Effective Time, the
Company Stock Plan shall terminate, and no further rights with respect to
Company Shares shall be granted thereunder.

(d) Treatment of Company Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any duly authorized committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Purchase Plan) shall adopt such resolutions
and take such other actions as may be required to provide the following,
effective upon the Effective Time: (i) participation in the Company Stock
Purchase Plan shall be limited to those employees who are participants on the
date of this Agreement, (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the
status of the Company Stock Purchase Plan as an "employee stock purchase plan"
within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, participants may not increase their payroll deduction elections or
rate of contributions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement,
(iii) no Company Shares may be purchased under the Company Stock Purchase Plan
with respect to offering periods beginning on or after the date of this
Agreement, (iv) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate, and (v) if the Effective Time occurs
prior to the last day of the offering period in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, each purchase right under the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be
terminated in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) 90% of the lesser of (x) the closing price of a
share 

of Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last trading
day before the commencement of the last offering period and (y) the closing
price of a share of Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on
the last trading day before the Effective Time; provided, that the number of
purchase rights with respect to which clause (v) shall be applicable shall be
subject to the limitations under the Company Stock Purchase Plan regarding the
maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be purchased by a
participant.

Section 2.04 Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards. As soon as
administratively practicable after the Effective Time (but, in any event, not
later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, through its or its Affiliate's payroll
agent, the payments required under Section 2.03(a)(i) and Section 2.03(d).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Company Award that is

respect to any such Company Award in violation of Section 409A of the Code.

Section 2.05 Appraisal Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Appraisal
Shares that are outstanding immediately before the Effective Time and that are
held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and, at the Effective Time,
such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any
right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares); provided, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 (each, an "Appraisal Withdrawal"), then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), less any applicable Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.02(g) with respect to
such payment.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Company Shares, Appraisal
Withdrawals and any other written instruments, notices, petitions or other
communication received by the Company prior to the Effective Time in
connection with the foregoing, in each case, pursuant to the provisions of the
DGCL concerning the rights of holders of Company Shares to require appraisal
of such Company Shares in accordance with this Section 2.05 and (B) to the
extent that the Company has Knowledge thereof, any applications to the
Delaware Court of Chancery for appraisal of the fair value of the Appraisal
Shares and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to
participate with the Company in any settlement negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any demands for 

appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, offer to
settle or settle any such demands or applications, or waive any failure to
timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or to timely take any other
action to exercise appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. Payment of
any amount payable to holders of Appraisal Shares shall be the obligation of
the Surviving Company.

Section 2.06 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this ARTICLE II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
issued and outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record
date of any share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such share dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as
(x) set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and
Merger Sub on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter") (it
being understood that any information set forth on one section or subsection
of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the
section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and
each other section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such information is
relevant to such other section or subsection) or (y) disclosed in any report,
schedule, form, statement or other document filed with the SEC since January
1, 2017, by the Company and publicly available at least two (2) business days
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed SEC Documents"), other than
disclosures contained in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements"
sections of such Filed SEC Documents or that otherwise constitute risk factors
or forward-looking statements, or of any risks generally faced by participants
in the industries in which the Company operates, in each case, to the extent
such sections, statements or risks do not disclose specific facts and
circumstances:

Section 3.01 Organization; Standing.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all
requisite power and authority necessary to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted and to own, lease and operate its assets and properties in all
material respects. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable
Law) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it
or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by
it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. A true and complete
copy of each of the Company Organizational Documents is included in the Filed
SEC Documents. The Company is not in violation of the Company Organizational
Documents and no Subsidiary of the Company is 

in violation of any of its organizational documents, except, in each case, as
would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
list of the Company's Subsidiaries, the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization of each such Subsidiary, and any other jurisdiction where each
such Subsidiary is licensed or specifically authorized to do business,
including under applicable Insurance Laws. Each of the Company's Subsidiaries
is duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing
(where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, except where the failure to
be so incorporated or organized, existing and in good standing has not had or
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
Insurance Regulator has notified the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
orally or in writing, that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
commercially domiciled in any jurisdiction.

Section 3.02 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value
$0.10 per share, ("Company Preferred Stock"). At the close of business on
August 14, 2018 (the "Capitalization Date"), (i) 29,766,719 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding, (iii) 7,022,760 shares of Company Common
Stock were held by the Company as treasury shares, (iv) 107,163 shares of
Company Common Stock were issuable with respect to outstanding restricted
stock unit awards and (v) 847,533 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable
with respect to outstanding performance unit awards. Since the Capitalization
Date through the date of this Agreement, other than in connection with the
vesting or settlement of Company Awards in accordance with their terms,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has issued any Company
Securities.

(b) Except as described in Section 3.02(a), as of the Capitalization Date,
there were (i) no outstanding Company Shares, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company, (ii) no outstanding securities of the Company
convertible into or exchangeable for Company Shares, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company, (iii) no outstanding options, warrants, rights or
other commitments or agreements to acquire from the Company, or that obligate
the Company to issue, any Company Shares, or other equity or voting interests
in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Company Shares, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company, (iv) no obligations of the
Company to grant, extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right,
convertible or exchangeable security or other similar agreement or commitment
relating to any Company Shares, or other equity or voting interests in, the
Company (collectively, "Company Rights", and the items in clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) being referred to collectively as "Company Securities") and (v)
no other obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
payments based on the price or value of any Company Securities or dividends
paid thereon. Other than in connection with the Company Awards, there are no
outstanding agreements or instruments of any kind that obligate the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Securities (or obligate the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreements relating to any Company Securities) or that grant from the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries any preemptive 

rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or
similar rights with respect to any Company Securities. Except as described in
Section 3.02(a), no direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company owns any
Company Shares. None of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a
party to any stockholders' agreement, voting trust agreement, registration
rights agreement or other similar agreement or understanding relating to any
Company Securities or any other agreement relating to the disposition, voting
or dividends with respect to any Company Securities. All issued and
outstanding Company Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. The Company
Common Stock and the Senior Notes constitute the only outstanding classes of
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries registered pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"). The Company Common
Stock is the only outstanding class of securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act.

(c) All of the issued and outstanding share capital or shares of capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company
(except for directors' qualifying shares or the like) are owned, directly or
indirectly, beneficially and of record, by the Company free and clear of all
Liens, except for such Liens as may be provided under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively, the "Securities Act") or other applicable securities Laws
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such share capital, shares of capital stock or other equity or voting
interests). Each issued and outstanding share capital or share of capital
stock of each Subsidiary of the Company that is held, directly or indirectly,
by the Company, is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable
(where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) and free of preemptive
rights, and there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
contracts or other commitments that obligate the Company or Subsidiary of the
Company to issue (other than to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company)
any share capital or shares of capital stock or other equity or voting
interests of any Subsidiary of the Company, including any right of conversion
or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or agreement, any
agreements granting any preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive
rights (other than as generally provided by applicable Law), rights of first
refusal or similar rights (to Persons other than the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company) with respect to any securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company has any outstanding equity
compensation plans relating to the share capital or capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends
or distributions except as required by applicable Law and, in the case of a
Subsidiary of the Company that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on
dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated
entities.

to the disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

of compensation due to any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (whether by virtue of any termination, severance, change
of control or similar benefit or otherwise), (ii) cause the Company to
transfer or set aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Company Plan
or (iii) limit or restrict the right to amend, terminate or transfer the
assets of any Company Plan before, on or following the Effective Time.

not cause any amounts payable under the Company Plans to fail to be deductible
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code. No
Company Plan provides for a Tax gross up, make whole or similar payment with
respect to the Taxes imposed under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

compliance with the HealthCare Reform Laws and (ii) has been in compliance
with all applicable HealthCare Reform Laws since January 1, 2015, except where
such noncompliance has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a

circumstance exists, that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company,
or any Health Plan, to penalties or excise taxes under Sections 4980D, 4980H,
or 4980I of the Code or any other provision 

of the HealthCare Reform Laws that has had or would reasonably be expected to

participating in a pension arrangement to which Sections 32, 38, 43, 47 or 58
of the UK Pensions Act 2004 applies. For these purposes "connected" and
"associate" have the meanings given to them in Sections 435 and 249 of the UK
Insolvency Act 1986 respectively. No employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries has the right to enhanced pension benefits on redundancy or early
retirement as a result of a transfer of an undertaking or part of an
undertaking to which either the UK Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations 1981 or the UK Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations 2006 applied that, in any case, has had or would

Section 5.02 Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation.

(a) Go-Shop Period. During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement
and continuing until 12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on the thirtieth (30th)
day after the date of this Agreement (the "No-Shop Period Start Date" and the
period starting from the date of this 

Agreement until the No-Shop Period Start Date, the "Go-Shop Period"), the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have
the right to:

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would be reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, including by providing
information, whether orally or in writing (including non-public information
and data) regarding the business, properties, assets, books, records and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person if the Company
receives from such Person (or has received from such Person) an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to
Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access
that was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub; and

(ii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, or otherwise cooperate with, assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage efforts by, any Persons or groups of
Persons (or Representatives of Persons) that have made, are seeking to make,
have informed the Company of an intention to make, or have publicly announced
an intention to make, any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;

provided, that during the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall not disclose any
material non-public information regarding the Company pursuant to the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the intended recipient thereof (but for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to enter into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with any Representatives of such intended
recipient) and shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
provide written notice to Parent and Merger Sub of the execution of an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with any Person during the Go-Shop Period
(which notice shall not be required to identify the Person entering into such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). No later than twenty-four (24) hours
after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall provide a written
notice to Parent and Merger Sub stating whether the Company Board has
determined that any Person submitting an Acquisition Proposal prior to the No-
Shop Period Start Date is an Excluded Party and identifying each such Excluded
Party.

(b) Prohibited Solicitation Activities. Except as expressly permitted by this
Section 5.02, from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
ARTICLE VII, the Company and its Subsidiaries:

(i) (A) shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and the Company
shall instruct its Representatives to terminate, any solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Person or its
Representatives (other than Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives)
conducted prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and (B) shall prohibit any Person other than Parent 

and Merger Sub and their Representatives from having access to any physical or
electronic data rooms relating to any possible Acquisition Proposal; and

(ii) shall not, and the Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries'
respective officers, directors and employees, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or
encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes
or would be reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B)
engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or otherwise cooperate with, assist, participate in,
facilitate or encourage efforts by, any Person or groups of Persons (or
Representatives of Persons) that have made, are seeking to make, have informed
the Company of an intention to make, or have publicly announced an intention
to make, any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (C) enter into any acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar definitive agreement, or any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, (D) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
similar anti-takeover Law, or any restrictive provision of any applicable
anti-takeover provision in the Company Charter or Company By-Laws,
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (and,
to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall promptly take all steps
necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted to any
Person other than Parent and Merger Sub under any such provisions) or (E)
resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(iii) The parties agree that for all purposes of this Agreement any violation
of the provisions of this Section 5.02(b) by any Representative of the Company
or any Representative of any of the Company's Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 5.02(b) by the Company. No later than twenty-four
(24) hours after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall, to the
extent it had not previously done so, deliver a request to each Person who
executed a confidentiality or similar agreement with the Company prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date in connection with considering or making an
Acquisition Proposal (other than any such Person that the Company is permitted
to continue discussions or negotiations with pursuant to Section 5.02(c)) to
promptly return or destroy any non-public information previously furnished or
made available to such Person or any of its Representatives on behalf of the
Company or any of its Representatives.

(c) Permitted Discussions. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section
5.02(b), in response to an Acquisition Proposal received prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, which Acquisition Proposal did not result
from any breach of this Section 5.02 and, with respect to clause (ii) of this
sentence, shall be a written Acquisition Proposal, (i) the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons making the
Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or to
request that any Acquisition Proposal made orally be made in writing and (ii)
if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the
Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, then the Company and 

its Representatives may (A) negotiate and enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making the
Acquisition Proposal and furnish pursuant thereto information (including non-
public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal; provided,
that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent copies of such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; provided, further that the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access
that was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and (B)
after entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group
of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal. The parties agree that,
notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the Company under
Section 5.02(b) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their Representatives may continue to engage in the
activities described in Section 5.02(a) with respect to any Excluded Party on
or after the No-Shop Period Start Date so long as such Excluded Party remains
an Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended or modified
Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party on or after the No-Shop
Period Start Date, and Section 5.02(b) and this Section 5.02(c) shall not
apply with respect thereto.

(d) Required Notices. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) notify Parent in the event that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives an
Acquisition Proposal and shall disclose to Parent the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person or
group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and unredacted copies of all
material correspondence or other material written documentation with respect
thereto (and written summaries of any material oral communications); provided,
that if the Company is specifically prohibited from disclosing the identity of
any Person making an Acquisition Proposal, the Company may redact that
identity and any other identifying information but shall otherwise provide all
such information relating to the Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material developments with
respect to any such Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes
thereto and provide copies of material correspondence and summaries of
material oral communications as contemplated above). The Company agrees that
it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with
any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company
from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section
5.02(d). For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent
pursuant to this Section 5.02 will be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) Company Board Recommendation. Except as provided in Section 5.02(f),
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withhold or
withdraw the Company Board Recommendation, (B) modify, qualify or amend the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, (C) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (D) approve
or publicly endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or refrain from
recommending against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or
exchange offer, within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such
tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act,
or (E) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten
(10) business days after receipt of a 

written request by Parent to make such public reaffirmation following the
receipt by the Company of a public Acquisition Proposal (other than in the
case of an Acquisition Proposal in the form of a tender offer or exchange
offer covered by clause (D)) that has not been withdrawn; provided, that
Parent may make any such request only once in any ten (10) business day period
and only once for each such public Acquisition Proposal and once for each
public material amendment to such Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change", it
being understood that a customary "stop, look or listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not be
prohibited and shall not, in and of itself, constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change) or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, amalgamation agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Acquisition Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
pursuant to Section 5.02(a) (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement").

(f) Permitted Change in Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything in Section
5.02(e), prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may, so long as the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Representatives have not breached this Section 5.02:

(i) in response to an Intervening Event, if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel,
that failure to do so would violate the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

(ii) in response to a Superior Proposal, if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would violate the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (A) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(d)(ii), pay the Company Termination Fee and enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;

provided, that the Company and the Company Board shall not take any such
action unless the Company has given Parent at least four (4) business days'
(subject to clause (y) of this sentence) prior written notice (a "Company
Notice") of its intention to take any such action, which notice (A) in the
case of an Intervening Event, specifies material changes, developments,
effects, circumstances, states of facts or events comprising such Intervening
Event and (B) in the case of a Superior Proposal, discloses (1) the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and its or their financing
sources (if applicable), and (2) a copy of the most current version of the
Company Acquisition Agreement (if any) with respect to such Superior Proposal
and any agreement in the Company's possession relating to the financing of
such Superior Proposal; provided, further, that during such four (4) business
day period (it being understood and agreed that (x) any change to the
financial or other material terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal shall
require an additional Company Notice to Parent of two (2) business days
running from the date of such notice (provided, that in 

no event shall the giving of such additional Company Notice shorten the four
(4) business day period under the initial Company Notice) and (y) with respect
to any Person or group, the notice period for the first Company Notice given
to Parent shall be four (4) business days and the notice period for any
Company Notice given following the expiration of such four (4) business day
period with respect to any Superior Proposal (or change thereto) made by such
Person or group shall be two (2) business days), (I) the Company shall have,
and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such commercially
reasonable adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company Board to no longer make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
determination that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(II) the Company Board shall have determined following the end of such period,
after considering the results of such negotiations and the revised proposals
made by Parent, if any, after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, (a) that the Superior Proposal giving rise
to such Company Notice continues to be a Superior Proposal or (b) that failure
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of the applicable
Intervening Event would violate the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

(g) Disclosures Under Law. Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to stockholders of the
Company a position or communication contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure or communication to stockholders of the Company that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is required by the directors'
fiduciary duties or applicable Law; provided that if any such public
disclosure by the Company or the Company Board contemplated by clause (i) or
(ii) above relating to an Acquisition Proposal has the substantive effect of
withdrawing, withholding or adversely modifying, qualifying or amending the
Company Board Recommendation or approving or endorsing an Acquisition Proposal
and meets the requirements set forth in Section 5.02(e)(i), such disclosure
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company
Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure (it being
understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change).

(h) Certain Definitions.

(i) As used in this Agreement, "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" shall
mean any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company that contains
provisions that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

(ii) As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
proposal (whether or not in writing) or offer from any Person or group (other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, any direct or indirect (A) acquisition,
including by means of bulk (or similar non-ordinary course) reinsurance of in-
force business consisting of a single transaction or a series of 

related transactions, that if consummated would result in any Person or group
owning 15% or more of the consolidated assets (based on the fair market value
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Company Board), revenues or net
income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or, solely with respect to any
such bulk (or similar non-ordinary course) reinsurance transaction, net
exposure to insured liabilities, (B) acquisition of Company Shares
representing 15% or more of the outstanding Company Shares, (C) tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group
having beneficial ownership of Company Shares representing 15% or more of the
outstanding Company Shares, (D) merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which
such Person or group (or the stockholders of any Person) would acquire,
directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the
Company (without taking into account the voting cutback provisions in the
Company By-Laws) or of the surviving entity in a merger or amalgamation
involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity or (E) combination of the foregoing, in each
case, other than the Transactions; provided that the ownership of the Company
Shares by the Existing Stockholder Group shall not constitute an Acquisition
Proposal under any of the foregoing clauses (A) to (E); provided further, that
neither (I) the renewal or amendment of any currently in-force reinsurance
arrangement or any replacement thereof, nor (II) any reinsurance arrangement
entered into in the ordinary course of business shall constitute an
Acquisition Proposal.

(iii) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal received after the date of this Agreement which
did not result from any breach of this Section 5.02 that the Company Board has
determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (A) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the identity of the
Person making the proposal (including any conditions relating to financing,
regulatory approvals or other events or circumstances beyond the control of
the party invoking the condition), and (B) if consummated, would be more
favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company
than the Merger; provided that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal", the references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

(iv) As used in this Section 5.02 and in Section 8.13, "group" has the meaning
ascribed to it in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(v) As used in this Agreement, "Intervening Event" shall mean a material
event, change, development, effect, occurrence or state of facts relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) that was not known to the Company Board
on the date of this Agreement, or (B) arising or occurring after the date of
this Agreement, in the case of (A) and (B), that is not related to the
receipt, existence of or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
relating thereto. 

Section 5.03 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company (with the assistance and cooperation of Parent as
reasonably requested by the Company) shall prepare the Proxy Statement and
file it with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make such filing no later than fifteen (15) business days following the date
of this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.02, the Company Board shall make the
Company Board Recommendation to the holders of Company Shares and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall use reasonable
best efforts to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall
cause the Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. Parent shall provide to the Company
all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may be reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall
otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments thereto received from the
SEC. The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders and at the time of the meeting of stockholders of the Company
to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval, any event occurs with
respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
change occurs with respect to other information to be included in the Proxy
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
shall promptly notify the other party of such event and the Company shall
promptly file, with Parent's cooperation, any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify Parent promptly in
writing upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all written correspondence
between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
(and Parent shall assist and cooperate with the Company to) promptly respond
to any comments received from the SEC concerning the Proxy Statement and to
resolve such comments with the SEC, and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to its
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
ten (10) business days) after the resolution of any such comments. To the
extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly file and
disseminate to the Company stockholders any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or any dissemination thereof to the holders of Company
Shares, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response, which the Company shall
consider in good faith.

(b) The Company shall take all necessary actions to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Company 

Stockholder Approval (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days following
the date the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement. Subject to Section 5.02, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit and secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been
terminated, the Company shall submit the Merger and this Agreement for the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting whether or
not an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise made known to the
Company Board, the Company, its Representatives or its stockholders. The
Company Stockholders Meeting and the record date therefor shall be set in
consultation with Parent and shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The
Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting except
to the extent any such postponement or adjournment is (i) required by Law or a
court or other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in connection
with any Actions in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or has
been requested by the SEC or its staff or (ii) requested by Parent (in
Parent's sole discretion) to permit additional time to solicit the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to
proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub.

(c) The Company agrees not to recognize, register or give effect to any
transfer of Company Shares made in violation of Section 4.02 of the Voting
Agreement.

Section 5.04 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is
expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including (A) taking all such
actions contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, (B) otherwise preparing
and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents and (C) executing and delivering
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions, (ii)
obtain all Consents from any Governmental Authority or third party (assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in Section 3.04(g))
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, including any
such Consents required with respect to the Company Insurance Approvals, the
Parent Insurance Approvals and under applicable Antitrust Laws, (iii) take all
steps that are necessary, proper or advisable to avoid any Actions by any
Governmental Authorities with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions
and (iv) defend or contest in good faith any Action by any third party,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or that could
otherwise prevent or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material
respect the consummation of the Transactions; provided that in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be required to commence any litigation against any
Governmental Authority. 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

(c) Without limiting the general applicability of Section 5.04(a), each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to in
consultation and cooperation with the other and as promptly as practicable and
in no event later than fifteen (15) business days following the date of this
Agreement, file (i) with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice the notification
and report form, if any, required under the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) all appropriate documents, forms, filings or submissions
required under any non-U.S. Antitrust Laws and (iii) with applicable Insurance
Regulators, all documents, forms, filings or other submissions required under
applicable Insurance Laws with respect to the Transactions. Any such filings
shall be in material compliance with the requirements of applicable Law. If
any of the approvals with respect to which any of the preceding clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) relate would require similar filings to be made by control
persons of the Parent or the Company under applicable Law, each of the Parent
and the Company shall cause each of their respective such control persons to
make such filings and use reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals.
Each of the parties shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
Section 5.04(a), (w) furnish to the other party such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with its
preparation of any documents, forms, filings or submissions contemplated by
the first sentence of this Section 5.04(c), (x) give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, of any communication with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, any Governmental Authority regarding
the Transactions, and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review, comment on and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of, and secure the participation of, the other party in connection with,
any such filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or requests, (y)
unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, (A) not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Transactions without the other party (other than telephone calls regarding
routine administrative matters), (B) give the other party reasonable prior
notice of any such meeting or substantive conversation, (C) in the event one
party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority from participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in
any such substantive conversation, to the extent permitted by applicable Law
or such Governmental Authority, keep such party apprised with respect thereto,
(D) cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white papers,
filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending this Agreement or any of the Transactions, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections
made by any Governmental Authority and (E) furnish the other party with copies
of all filings, submissions, substantive correspondence and substantive
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its Affiliates and their respective 

Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
any Governmental Authority's staff, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Transactions (excluding any personally sensitive
information) and (z) comply with any inquiry or request from any Governmental
Authority as promptly as reasonably practicable with respect to this Agreement
and the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Company and
Parent shall give to the other prompt written notice if it, or any of its
Affiliates, receives any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby and, in the
case of any such notice or communication that is in writing, shall promptly
furnish the other party with a copy thereof. The parties agree not to extend,
directly or indirectly, any waiting period under any applicable Antitrust Law
or enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to materially delay
or not to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions, except with
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in the context of seeking such a
delay.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be
obligated to take or refrain from taking, or to agree to it or its Affiliates
taking or refraining from taking, any action, or to permit or suffer to exist
any condition, limitation, restriction or requirement imposed by a
Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate with any other
actions, conditions, limitations, restrictions or requirements, would or would
reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the business,
condition (financial or otherwise), operations or results of operations of (i)
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any such action, condition, limitation,
restriction or requirement, a "Parent Burdensome Condition"), including,
without limiting the foregoing, a Governmental Authority imposing Solvency II
capital requirements on any United States Subsidiary of Parent that is not
otherwise already subject to Solvency II capital requirements. Without the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not, and shall cause the
Company Insurance Subsidiaries and its other Affiliates not to, take or
refrain from or to agree to the taking or refraining from any action or to
permit or suffer to exist any restriction, condition, limitation or
requirement that would or would reasonably be expected to result, individually
or in the aggregate, in a Parent Burdensome Condition being imposed by a
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Parent being
entitled to invoke a Parent Burdensome Condition, the parties and their
respective Representatives shall meet and confer in good faith in order to (A)
exchange and review their respective views and positions as to such Parent
Burdensome Condition and (B) discuss and present to, and engage with, the
applicable Governmental Authority regarding any potential approaches or
workarounds that would avoid such Parent Burdensome Condition or mitigate its
impact so it is no longer a Parent Burdensome Condition.

Section 5.05 Transfer Taxes. All share transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving
Company, and, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in preparing, executing and filing any applicable Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

Section 5.06 Public Announcements; Other Communications. Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
reasonable opportunity to 

review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the Transactions, and shall not (and shall not cause or permit
their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives to) issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court process or the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system and in connection with any Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with Section 5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial press
releases to be issued with respect to the Transactions following execution of
this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties
hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties shall have no consultation
or other obligation pursuant to this Section 5.06 with respect to any press
release or other public statements related to any actual or contemplated
litigation between or among the parties to this Agreement. The Company will
consult with Parent prior to making any substantive internal announcements or
other substantive communications to its employees or other constituents with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and will give good faith
consideration to reasonable comments proposed by Parent; provided that the
Company shall not be required to consult with Parent prior to making any such
announcements or communications if the substance thereof was publicly
disclosed by Parent or previously subject to the foregoing requirements.

Section 5.07 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable
Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parent's
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parent's
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request; provided that
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company; provided further, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract
or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, waive the protection
of an attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege or expose the Company
to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or Personal Information.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide
access or information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it
shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or
information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the
extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate
the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.
All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 5.07 shall be
directed to the Person designated by the Company. Until the Effective Time,
the information provided will be subject to the terms of the confidentiality
agreement dated as of May 30, 2018, by and between the Company and Parent (as
may in the future be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

Section 5.08 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director or officer of the Company 

or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, together with such Person's heirs,
executors and administrators, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the
"Indemnitees") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in
part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the Company
or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the
Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company
or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under
clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including
any Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the
enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or advancement
right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law
and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the
Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in
the Company Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement in
existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification
between the Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Company Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, advance any
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee
under this Section 5.08 (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations referred to in this Section 5.08) as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that the individual to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.08(a).

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
Section 5.08 (each, a "Claim") for which indemnification has been sought by an
Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and
the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide
access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or
cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith. 

(c) For the six (6)-year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall substitute the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance of the Company and its Subsidiaries covering
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
those individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior
to the Effective Time become) covered by the directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries with a "tail"
policy, issued by reputable insurers, on terms and scope with respect to such
coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of
such policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that, if the
annual premium for such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current annual
premium (such 300% threshold, the "Maximum Premium"), then Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with
the best coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium not in
excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company may with the consent of Parent (not
to be unreasonably withheld), and at the request of Parent shall (in which
case, at Parent's expense), prior to the Effective Time purchase, for an
aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate Maximum Premium for six (6)
years, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing at
least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid
"tail" policy has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy
all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.08(c) and the
Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all
of its obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Organizational Documents, by Contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.08 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.08 applies unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.08
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.08).

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 5.08.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification 

provided for in this Section 5.08 is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies.

Section 5.09 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.10 Employee Matters.

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time (or, for individuals who are
not actively employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time due to
disability or other approved leave, the date such individual presents for
active employment) and ending on the one (1) year anniversary thereof (the
"Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to provide, each individual who continues to be employed by the
Company or any of its Affiliates (including Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries) following the Effective Time (each, a "Company Employee") with
(i) base salary, wages and target annual or quarterly cash incentive
opportunities that are each no less favorable than the base salary, wages and
target annual or quarterly cash incentive opportunities provided to such
Company Employee by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) long-term incentive opportunities for Company
Employees who were eligible for a long-term incentive opportunity under a
Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) employee benefits
(other than long-term incentive opportunities) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries) from time to time, and (iv) severance benefits determined using
a formula that is no less favorable than the greater of (A) the severance
formula applicable to such Company Employee by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the severance
formula applicable to similarly situated employee of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2019, Parent shall, or its applicable Subsidiaries shall, ensure
that the premium cost for Company Employees in the aggregate of Company
sponsored medical, dental and vision coverage is not materially greater than
the premium cost for Company Employees in the aggregate of employer-sponsored
medical, dental and vision immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause all of its Affiliates
to, adopt such resolutions and amendments, and use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all such other actions as may be required or desirable, to
provide that each Company Plan and any other employee benefit plan, program,
policy or arrangement (other than any Foreign Plans and except as provided in
Section 5.10(b)) shall terminate effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and in each case, conditioned upon the Closing; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall, irrevocably
take all actions required to terminate and liquidate The Navigators Group,
Inc. Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with the terms of
the Plan and the provisions of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) immediately
prior to the Effective Time and to terminate each Qualified Plan effective as
of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, in each case conditioned
upon the Closing. 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume and
honor in accordance with their terms (including any amendment and termination
provisions thereof), any Company Plan that is an employment agreement or a
retention plan or program maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement and
listed on Section 5.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) With respect to any accrued but unused paid time off to which any Company
Employee is entitled pursuant to the paid time off policy or individual
agreement or other arrangement applicable to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "PTO Policy"), and as made available to
Parent pursuant to Section 5.10(h), Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) allow such Company Employee to use such accrued paid time
off consistent with the PTO Policy for use of paid time off, (ii) if any
Company Employee's employment involuntarily terminates or the Company Employee
retires during the Continuation Period, pay the Company Employee, in cash, an
amount equal to the value of the accrued unused paid time off, to the same
extent that the Company Employee would have received a cash payment therefor
under the PTO Policy immediately prior to the Effective Time had his or her
employment terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) if
any Company Employee voluntarily terminates employment or is terminated for
Cause (as that term is defined in the Hartford Severance Pay Plan) during the
Continuation Period, pay the Company Employee in cash, an amount equal to no
greater than the value of up to forty (40) hours of accrued but unused paid
time off (except to the extent required by applicable law).

(d) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries
providing any benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective Time,
including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
(including any paid time off and severance plans), for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, and vesting (and excluding
benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies under any defined benefit
pension plan and eligibility for post-retirement welfare benefits), each
Company Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized
by the Company or such Subsidiary for a similar purpose) as made available to
Parent pursuant to Section 3.11(e) shall be treated as service with the Parent
and its Subsidiaries; provided, that such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits
or compensation for the same period of service.

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, "actively at work" requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, "actively at work"
requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under
the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to,
recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee 

(and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time and to
credit each Company Employee under a cafeteria plan (within the meaning of
section 125 of the Code) maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries with an
amount equal to such Company Employee's balance (positive or negative) under
the health care flexible spending account and/or dependent care spending
account under the cafeteria plan maintained by the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time; provided that, in each case, the Company provides
Parent with all information reasonably requested by Parent, in the electronic
format reasonably requested by Parent, in order for Parent to comply with the
foregoing.

(f) Each Company Employee who participates in the Company Annual Incentive
Plan in respect of the Company's fiscal year 2018 shall be eligible for a
payment no less than that due with respect to such Company Employee's annual
bonus under such plan in accordance with the terms thereof calculated based on
actual performance for such period (or, if the Effective Time occurs prior to
the end of such period, based on actual performance from January 1, 2018
through the Effective Time, without proration for the portion of the period
after the Effective Time), provided and to the extent that the Company shall
have fully accrued therefor as of the Effective Time. If the Effective Time
occurs on or after January 1, 2019, each Company Employee who, immediately

warranties set forth in this Agreement or the failure in any material respect
of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement,
including to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions as
required by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, has
been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be
consummated on or before such date (it being understood that Parent and Merger
Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso);

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.01(c) shall be

(i) if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement (other than as addressed in Section 7.01(c)(ii)), which

cured prior to the Walk-Away Date, or if capable of being cured, has not been
cured by the Company within thirty (30) days after the Company's receipt of

Parent's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(c)(i) and the basis for such termination (or in any event has not been
cured by the Walk-Away Date); provided that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(c)(i) if Parent or
Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

Board makes or publicly proposes to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
(B) there shall have occurred any material Willful Breach of Section 5.02 or
Section 5.03; or

(d) by the Company: 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b) and
(B) is incapable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date, or if capable of
being cured, has not been cured by Parent or Merger Sub within thirty (30)
days after Parent's receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to

Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d)(i) and the basis for such
termination (or in any event has not been cured by the Walk-Away Date);
provided that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.01(d)(i) if the Company is then in material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder;

termination the Company pays the amounts due under Section 7.03 in accordance
with the terms thereof.

shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective directors,
officers and Affiliates, except (a) as liability may exist pursuant to the
provisions specified in the immediately preceding parenthetical that survive
such termination and (b) that no such termination shall relieve any party from
liability for any Willful Breach by such party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or fraud; provided
that if either party receives any payments for damages pursuant to this
Section 7.02 from another party in respect of any such Willful Breach and also
receives any payment pursuant to Section 7.03, the amount of such payments for
damages made by the applicable party in respect of any such Willful Breach

and (C) within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated,
the Company consummates any Acquisition Proposal or enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal that is thereafter

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(ii); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(ii);

provided, that in the event this Agreement is terminated by either Parent

pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent
Parent's Expenses by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) business

ARTICLE VIII 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.01 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. This ARTICLE VIII
and the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in ARTICLE
II and in Section 5.08 and Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time. No
other representations, warranties, obligations or agreements in this Agreement
shall survive the Effective Time.

Section 8.02 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, only by written
agreement of the parties hereto, approved by the Parent Board and the Company
Board; provided, that following receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by
applicable Law would require further approval by the holders of Company Shares
without such approval.

Section 8.03 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc.. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of the other party or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such party's
conditions (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a
single party for purposes of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof 

preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.04 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this Section 8.04 shall be null and void.

Section 8.05 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the other parties hereto.

Section 8.06 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
together with any Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Voting Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties hereto and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and (b) are not intended to and shall not
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, except for: (i) if the Effective Time occurs, (A) the right of the
holders of Company Shares to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
accordance with Section 2.01 and Section 2.02 and (B) the right of the holders
of Company Awards as set forth in Section 2.03 and Section 2.04, and (ii) the
provisions set forth in Section 5.08 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall have the right to seek on behalf of the holders
of Company Shares and Company Awards, through an Action brought by the
Company, damages from Parent in the event of a breach of this Agreement by
Parent in respect of amounts that would have been recoverable by such holders
under the circumstances of the applicable breach if all such holders brought
an action against Parent and were recognized as third party beneficiaries
hereunder. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties in
accordance with Section 8.03 without notice or liability to any other Person.
Persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.07 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to Contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that state, regardless of the Laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of Laws principles. 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in respect of the
Transactions shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, if both
the Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal courts within the State of
Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other
state court within the State of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate
court therefrom. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such Actions and irrevocably
waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the
maintenance of any such Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set
forth in this Section 8.07(b) shall not constitute general consents to service
of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that
service of process upon such party in any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight courier at
the address set forth in Section 8.11 of this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law; provided, that nothing contained in the foregoing
shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding,
or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

Section 8.08 Specific Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached,
including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the right of the Company to cause the Merger to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the courts
described in Section 8.07(b) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.08 shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. If, prior to the Walk-Away Date, any party hereto brings any
Action, in each case, in accordance with this Section 8.08, to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended (x) for the period
during which such Action is pending, plus ten (10) business days or (y) by
such other time period established by the court presiding over such Action, as
the case may be. 

Section 8.09 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.09.

Section 8.10 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and
all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

Section 8.15 Interpretation. 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein", "hereto" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The terms "or", "any" and "either" are not exclusive. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall". All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements
or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments
thereto and instruments incorporated therein. Unless otherwise specifically
indicated, all references to "dollars" or "$" shall refer to the lawful money
of the United States. References to a Person are also to its permitted assigns
and successors.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.
