Section 2.8 Preparation of Final Closing Statement.

  



   | (1)| Within 45 days following the Closing Date (or such other date as
is mutually agreed to by the Vendors and the Purchaser in writing), the
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Vendors a draft consolidated
statement of the Vendors' Share of Working Capital prepared as of the close
of business on the Effective Date and the Vendors' Share of Closing
Obligations (the "Draft Closing Statement"). The Draft Closing Statement will
be prepared in accordance with GAAP and shall include reasonable detail on

Draft Closing Statement in accordance with this Section 2.8(1) within 45 days
following the Closing Date, the Purchaser is deemed to have accepted and
approved the Estimated Closing Statement and such Estimated Closing Statement
will be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties, absent manifest error
and will become the "Final Closing Statement" on the next Business Day
following the end of such 60-day period following the Closing Date.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| The Vendors shall have 20 Business Days to review the Draft
Closing Statement following receipt of it and the Vendors must notify the
Purchaser in writing if they have any objections to the Draft Closing
Statement within such 20 Business Day period. The notice of objection must
contain a statement of the basis of each of the objections and each amount in
dispute. The Purchaser shall provide access, upon every reasonable request, to
the Vendors and their auditors, to all work papers of the Purchaser,
accounting books and records and the appropriate personnel to verify the
accuracy, presentation and other matters relating to the preparation of
the Draft Closing Statement, subject to execution and delivery by the Vendors
and their auditors of any agreement or other document, including any release,
waiver or indemnity that the Purchaser's auditors reasonably require prior to
providing such access.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| If the Vendors send a notice of objection of the Draft Closing
Statement in accordance with Section 2.8(2), the Vendors and the
Purchaser shall promptly meet to try to resolve such objections within 20
Business Days following receipt of the notice. Failing resolution of any
objection to the Draft Closing Statement raised by the Vendors, only the
amount(s) in dispute will be submitted for determination to an independent
firm of chartered accountants mutually agreed to by the Vendors and the
Purchaser (and, failing such agreement between the Vendors and the
Purchaser within a further period of 5 Business Days, such independent firm
of chartered accountants will be KPMG United Kingdom, or if such firm is
unable to act Ernst and Young United Kingdom). The independent firm of chartered
accountants shall identify a member at its London, England, office to act in
such mandate and shall determine the procedures applicable to the resolution
of the amounts in dispute with the primary purposes of minimizing expenses of
the Vendors and the Purchaser and expediting the accurate resolution of the
dispute. The determination of such firm of chartered accountants of the
amount(s) in dispute and any corresponding changes flowing from the
resolution of such amounts in dispute will be final and binding upon the
Parties and will not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error. Such firm
of chartered accountants are deemed to be acting as experts and not as
arbitrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the determination of such firm of
chartered accountants of the amount(s) in dispute shall in no event be more
favorable to the Purchaser than reflected in the Draft Closing Statement
delivered by the Purchaser or more favorable to the Vendors than shown in the
proposed changes to the Draft Closing Statement delivered by the Vendors under
its notice of objection pursuant to Section 2.8(2). During the review by the
firm of chartered accountants, the Purchaser and the Vendors shall each make
available to such firm of chartered accountants, such individuals and such
information, facilities, books, records and work papers as may be reasonably
required by the firm of chartered accountants to fulfill their
obligations hereunder during normal business hours (such access not to
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Purchaser or the Vendors).  
---|---|--- 
  



    

 18

 



    



   | (4)| If the Vendors do not notify the Purchaser of any objection
within the 20 Business Day period, the Vendors are deemed to have accepted
and approved the Draft Closing Statement and such Draft Closing Statement
will be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties, absent manifest error
and will become the "Final Closing Statement" on the next Business Day
following the end of such 20 Business Day period.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| If the Vendors send a notice of objection in accordance with
Section 2.7, the Vendors and the Purchaser shall revise the Draft Closing
Statement to reflect the final resolution or final determination of such
objections under Section 2.8(3) within five (5) Business Days following such
final resolution or determination. Such revised Draft Closing Statement will
be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties, absent manifest error. The
Draft Closing Statement will become the "Final Closing Statement" on the next
Business Day following revision of the Draft Closing Statement under this
Section 2.8(5).  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (6)| The Vendors and the Purchaser shall each bear their own fees and
expenses, including the fees and expenses of their respective auditors, in
preparing or reviewing, as the case may be, the Draft Closing Statement. In
the case of a dispute and the retention of a firm of chartered accountants to
determine such amount(s) in dispute, the costs and expenses of such firm of
chartered accountants will be borne by the Vendors and the Purchasers in such
proportions as the positions taken by each of the Vendors and the Purchaser
are successful when compared to the Final Closing Statement. However, the
Vendors and the Purchaser shall each bear their own costs in presenting their
respective cases to such firm of chartered accountants.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (7)| The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this Section
2.8 for resolving disputes with respect to the Draft Closing Statement is the
sole and exclusive method of resolving such disputes, absent manifest error.
This Section 2.8(7) will not prohibit any Party from instigating litigation to
compel specific performance of this Section 2.8 or to enforce the
determination of the independent firm of chartered accountants.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 2.9 Price Adjustment.

  



   | (1)| The Purchase Price will be increased or decreased, as the case
may be, dollar-for-dollar, to the extent that the sum of (a) Working Capital
and (b) Closing Obligations (expressed as a negative amount), as determined
from the Final Closing Statement (the "Final Closing Amount"), is more or
less than the sum of (c) Estimated Effective Date Working Capital and (d)
Estimated Closing Obligations (expressed as a negative amount) (the
"Estimated Closing Amount").  
---|---|--- 
  



    

 19

 



    



   | (2)| If the Final Closing Amount is more than the Estimated Closing
Amount, the Purchaser shall pay to each Vendor its Pro Rata Share of the
amount of such difference as an increase to the Purchase Price, in cash. The
Vendors and the Purchaser shall, within five Business Days after the Draft
Closing Statement becomes the Final Closing Statement in accordance with
Section 2.7 or Section 2.8, as the case may be, deliver to the Escrow Agent a
fully executed certificate (the "Escrow Certificate"), to release the
Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Vendors. The Purchaser shall pay directly to
each Vendor its Pro Rata Share of the amount by which the Final Closing
Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Amount in cash.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| If the Final Closing Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Amount, each Vendor shall pay its Pro Rata Share of the amount of such
difference as a decrease to the Purchase Price to the Purchaser, in cash. The
Vendors and the Purchaser shall, within five Business Days after the Draft
Closing Statement becomes the Final Closing Statement in accordance with
Section 2.7 or Section 2.8, as the case may be, deliver to the Escrow Agent
an Escrow Certificate, certifying (a) the amount of the payment to be made, if
any, to the Vendors and (b) the amount to be released back to the Purchaser.
If the Estimated Closing Amount exceeds the Final Closing Amount by more than
the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the Vendors shall pay directly to
the Purchaser the amount of such difference in cash (for the avoidance of
doubt, the Purchaser shall not be required to set off an amount from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund for that purpose).  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| Any increase or decrease to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 2.9 will be applied on an equivalent, per-Purchased Security basis to
the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Warrants.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 2.10 No Effect on Other Rights.

  



  

The determination and adjustment of the Purchase Price in accordance with the
provisions of this Article will not limit or affect any other rights
or causes of action either the Purchaser or the Vendors may have with respect
to the representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities in its favor
contained in this Agreement.

except as disclosed in Section 3.1(o) of the Disclosure Letter. With respect
to each Lease (i) all rents and additional rents have been paid, (ii) no
waiver, indulgence or postponement of the lessee's obligations has been

Lease have been fully performed. Each of the Non-Oil and Gas Leased Properties
is adequate and suitable for the purposes for which it is presently being
used and one or more of the Purchased Corporations have adequate rights of

Section 8.6 Notification of and Procedure for Third Party Claims.

  



   | (1)| If a Third Party Claim is instituted or asserted against an
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the Third Party Claim.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| The omission to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Person, unless the notification occurs after the expiration of the specified
period set out in Section 8.4 or (and only to that extent that) the omission
to notify materially prejudices the ability of the Indemnifying Party to
exercise its right to defend provided in this Section 8.6.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| Subject to the terms of this Section 8.6 upon receiving notice
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may participate in the
investigation and defense of the Third Party Claim and may also elect to
assume the investigation and defense of the Third Party Claim.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| The Indemnifying Party may not assume the investigation and
defense of a Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party
if:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| the Indemnifying Party is also a party to the Third Party Claim
and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation
would be inappropriate;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to
the Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to defend the Third Party
Claim and provide indemnification with respect to the Third Party Claim;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| in the reasonable judgement of the Indemnified Person, the
estimated amount of likely Damages in connection with such claim is greater
than the unused portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund (provided that the
Indemnifying Party may add sufficient funds to the Indemnity Escrow Fund for
this purpose to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
until such Third Party Claim is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction and non-appealable);  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| subject to Section 8.6(6), the Third Party Claim is in respect
of Taxes unless the assessment or reassessment relates solely to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period;  
---|---|--- 
  



    

 67

 



    



   | (e)| in the reasonable judgement of the Indemnified Person, such
claim involves material reputational risks to the Indemnified Person;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| the Indemnifying Party does not unconditionally acknowledge in
writing its obligation to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Person harmless
with respect to the Third Party Claim; or  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| the Third Party Claim seeks relief against the
Indemnified Person other than monetary damages or the Indemnified Person
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that the
Third Party Claim may materially adversely affect it or its Affiliates and the
Indemnified Person has notified the Indemnifying Party that it will exercise
its exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle the Third Party Claim.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| In order to assume the investigation and defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party must give the Indemnified Person
written notice of its election within 15 days of Indemnifying Party's receipt
of written notice of the Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person shall comply with the
procedures set out in Schedule 8.7(5).  
---|---|--- 
  

   



   | (6)| In addition to the foregoing, if the Third Party Claim is in
respect of Taxes, the following additional rules shall also apply:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| if the Indemnifying Person is entitled to and elects to assume
the investigation and defense of a Third Party Claim in respect of Taxes
then:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| the Indemnifying Person shall provide to the Indemnified Person
in a timely manner (x) any proposed written communications and other documents
to be submitted to the relevant Governmental Authority or filed with a court
in respect of any assessment or reassessment for review by the Indemnified
Person and (y) copies of any correspondence received from the Governmental
Authority relating to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Person
shall consult with the Indemnified Person with respect to the materials
provided pursuant to (x) above prior to the submission or filing thereof;
and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| notwithstanding anything in this Article 8 or the procedures
set out in Schedule 8.7(5), if the Indemnified Person has assumed control of
the investigating and defence of a Third Party Claim in respect of Taxes, the
concurrence of the Indemnifying Person to any compromise or settlement of such
Third Party Claim shall not be required for any Third Party Claim under
$1,000,000 and, notwithstanding Section (3) of Schedule 8.7(5), the
Indemnifying Person shall be bound by any such compromise and settlement;  
---|---|--- 
  

   



    

 68

 



    



   | (b)| to the extent payment has not already been made by
the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person, and if the Third Party
Claim is a claim for which the Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification under this Article 8, should the Indemnified Person be
required by the relevant assessing authority to pay any amount in respect of
such Third Party Claim, forthwith upon request therefor, the Indemnifying
Person will pay to the Indemnified Person the amount that the Indemnified
Person is required to pay to such Governmental Authority. Should the
Indemnifying Person fail to pay such amount within 30 days after receipt of
written request from the Indemnified Person to do so, the right of the
Indemnifying Person to control the contesting of such Third Party Claim will
cease; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Within 10 days of a final determination of such Third
Party Claim in respect of Taxes, and if the Third Party Claim is a claim for
which the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification under this
Article 8, the Indemnifying Person will pay to the Indemnified Person the full
amount owing to Indemnified Person, to the extent that such amounts have not
been previously paid to Indemnified Person.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 8.7 Adjustment to Purchase Price.

  



  

Any payment made by the Vendors as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article 8 will constitute a dollar-for-dollar decrease of the Purchase Price
and any payment made by the Purchaser as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article 8 will constitute a dollar-for-dollar increase of the Purchase
Price.

Article 10 
 POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

  



  

Section 10.1 Access to Books and Records.

  



  

For a period of two years from the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to retain all original Books and Records
relating to any Purchased Corporation that are part of the Books and Records
existing on the Closing Date. So long as any such Books and Records are
retained by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the Vendors shall have
the reasonable right to inspect and to make copies (at its own expense) of
them at any time upon reasonable request during normal business hours and upon
reasonable written notice for any proper purpose and without undue
interference to the business operations of the Purchased Corporations. The
Purchaser shall have the right to have its representatives present during any
such inspection.

  



  

Section 10.2 Confidentiality.

  



  

Each Vendor hereby acknowledges that each is in possession of proprietary
information in connection with the business of each Purchased Corporation,
the Assets and the Purchased Corporations ("Confidential Information"). From
and after Closing, each Vendor shall and shall cause its affiliates and
representatives to keep confidential and shall not use for any improper
purpose or disclose to any other Person any Confidential Information, unless
such information is or becomes generally available to the public other than
as a result of a disclosure in violation of this Agreement. In the event any
Vendor is required by Applicable Law to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Vendor shall, to the extent not prohibited by
Applicable Law, provide the Purchaser with prompt notice of such requirements
so that the Purchaser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 10.2. Each Vendor
agrees that such obligation of confidentiality continues after the Closing
Date and, after the Closing, it shall return to the Purchaser or cause to be
destroyed all Confidential Information in its possession or control.

provide comments on such Tax Returns prior to filing by the Purchaser, and
any changes requested by the Vendors will not be unreasonably denied by the
Purchaser. Such returns shall be prepared and filed on a basis consistent with
Applicable Laws and the past practices and procedures of the relevant entity
provided that no reserve may be claimed if any amount could be included in the
income of the Purchased Corporations for any period ending after the
Effective Date. To the extent such Taxes are not reflected as a liability on
the Final Closing Statement, the Vendors shall pay to the Purchaser all Taxes
(a) in respect of a Pre-Effective Tax Period, or (b) in respect of the
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Effective Date (as determined under
Section 8.2(4)), both as reflected on the Tax Returns prepared under Section
10.3(1).  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| The Vendor and the Purchaser will co-operate fully and assist
each other and make available to each other in a timely fashion all data and
other information as may reasonably be required for the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns of the Purchased Corporations and will preserve that

Section 11.4 Third Party Beneficiaries.

  



  

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including Section 8.2 and
Section 8.3 (i) the Vendors and the Purchaser intend that this Agreement will
not benefit or create any right or cause of action in favor of any Person,
other than the Parties and (ii) no Person, other than the Parties, is
entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing or other forum; provided, that the Financing Parties and
each of their respective Affiliates and their respective current, former and
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees
or representatives (collectively, the "Financing Source Parties") shall be
express third-party beneficiaries with respect to Section 7.2(2), Section
11.6, this Section 11.4 and Section 11.11 (each an "FS Provision"). The
Vendors acknowledge to each Indemnified Person in respect of the Purchaser
his/her direct rights against it under Article 8 of this Agreement and the
Purchaser acknowledges to each Indemnified Person in respect of the Vendors
his/her direct rights against it under Article 8 of this Agreement. To the
extent required by law to give full effect to these direct rights, the
Vendors and the Purchaser agree and acknowledge that they are acting as agent
of their respective Indemnified Persons. The Parties reserve their right to

effective without the written consent of the Financing Parties.

  



  

Section 11.7 Waiver.

  



  

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not
similar). No waiver will be binding unless executed in writing by the Party
to be bound by the waiver. A Party's acceptance of any certificate delivered
on Closing or failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement
will not operate as a waiver of that. A single or partial exercise of any
right will not preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that
right or the exercise of any other right.

  



  

Section 11.8 Entire Agreement.

  



  

This Agreement, the Disclosure Letter, together with the Ancillary
Agreements, (i) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties; (ii)

Parties ("Claim") under or in connection with, or in any way relating to this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of any Financing or the terms or
the performance thereof shall be raised to and exclusively determined by the

parties hereto unconditionally consent and submit. Each party hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue
of Claim arising out of this Agreement in such court and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agree not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such Claim brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.
