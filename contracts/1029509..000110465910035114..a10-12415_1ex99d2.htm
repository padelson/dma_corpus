 **2.5** ** ****Employees and Employment Agreements**

  



  

(a) Unless otherwise agreed upon among the Parties, ARC shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to, not less than 15 days after the date of this
Agreement, determine the employees of Storm who will either be offered
employment with ARC or a subsidiary of ARC or be provided with confirmations
of continued employment, as the case may be at the Effective Time (such
employees being the " **Continuing Employees** "). Unless otherwise agreed to
between the parties, the Continuing Employees shall not include the employees
of Storm and its subsidiaries who are identified in the Disclosure Letter.
The Continuing Employees, unless their employment is terminated,
shall continue to be employed on the terms and conditions (including
compensation or severance) comparable, in the aggregate, to the terms and
conditions on which they are currently employed. ARC shall honour the terms
of all consulting agreements existing as of the date hereof between Storm and
its consultants, copies of which consulting agreements have been provided to
ARC prior to the date hereof.

  



  

(b) In the event that any employee of Storm is not continued as a Continuing
Employee by ARC, a subsidiary of ARC or Storm, as applicable, and such
employee is thereby entitled to a severance payment as provided for in the
employees employment or other agreement (all of which agreements have been
provided to ARC) or otherwise under Applicable Law or, with the consent of
ARC, acting reasonably, as determined by Storm, the Parties agree that the
amount of such severance payment shall not be less than the amount provided
for in the employees employment or other agreement or as required by
Applicable Law. All severance or similar payments to employees, directors and
officers of Storm shall be made by Storm on the Effective Date or as soon as
practicable thereafter.

  



  

(c) In the event that any employee of Storm is continued as a Continuing
Employee by ARC, a subsidiary of ARC or Storm, as applicable, such employee
shall be entitled to a retention bonus in an amount not less than the
severance payment provided for in the employees employment or other
agreement or otherwise under Applicable Law (a " **Retention Bonus** "),
which Retention Bonus will be paid on the date that is 6 months after the
Effective Date provided that the employee remains as an employee of ARC, a
subsidiary of ARC or Storm on the date of payment.

  



  

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the Arrangement will result in a "change of
control" for purposes of existing Storm executive and employee (if
applicable) employment and other agreements including, without limitation,
retention bonus agreements, if any. The Disclosure Letter includes Storms
_bona fide_ good faith estimate, having regard to the assumptions set
forth therein, on an employee by employee basis of the Storm Change of

on the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter.

otherwise agreed to in writing by ARC Resources or Storm)) effective before
the Effective Date and conditional upon the subsequent consummation of the
Arrangement and the agreement of the holders of the Storm Options to the
exercise (or termination) of such Storm Options (or, if required, amend any
outstanding Storm Options to accelerate the vesting of such Storm Options
effective before the Effective Date and conditional upon the subsequent
consummation of the Arrangement and the agreement of the holders of the Storm
Options to the exercise (or termination) of such Storm Options) in order that
all such outstanding Storm Options shall be fully vested and will be either
exercised before the Effective Time in accordance with their terms or
terminated. The Disclosure Letter includes a list of all Storm Options
outstanding on the date hereof.

  



  

(b) In addition to the manner of treatment of Storm Options set forth above,
Storm shall purchase and cancel all of the "out-of-the-money" Storm Options
for an amount of not more than $0.01 per Storm Option.

Effective Time shall be deemed terminated.

matters relating to ExploreCo including, without limitation, any compensation
arrangements shall be determined by Storm. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that Storm and ExploreCo may submit such compensation arrangements to the
Storm Shareholders at the Storm Meeting for approval in accordance with the
requirements of the TSX or any other stock exchange on which ExploreCo
intends to seek the listing of the ExploreCo Shares.

  



  

(d) Storm, as the sole shareholder of ExploreCo, covenants and agrees to
cause ExploreCo to take all steps, to do and perform all such acts and things
and to execute and deliver all such agreements, documents and other
instruments as are reasonably necessary or desirable to effect and complete
the transactions contemplated herein and in the Plan of Arrangement in
accordance with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof and any and all
covenants and agreements of Storm contained herein and in the Plan of
Arrangement shall, to the extent that they are required to be performed by
ExploreCo, be and be deemed to be covenants and agreements of both Storm and
ExploreCo.

a dividend or return of capital and the remaining net proceeds from such sale
will be retained by Storm; and

  



  

(b) ARC Resources shall be issued such number of ExploreCo Shares which have
a value of $2.9 million where the value of each such ExploreCo Share is equal
to the ExploreCo Share Value. Such ExploreCo Shares shall be "freely
tradeable" (other than as a result of any "control block" restrictions that
may arise by virtue of the ownership thereof), subject to the TSX providing
listing approval for such shares.

  



  

 **2.9** ** ****Effective Date**

  



  

The Arrangement shall become effective at the Effective Time on the Effective
Date.

 **2.10** ** ****Recommendation of Storm Board of Directors**

  



  

The Storm Board of Directors has unanimously determined that the Arrangement
is in the best interests of Storm and the Storm Shareholders, and has, based
upon, among other things, the opinion of Storms financial advisor,
unanimously determined that the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point
of view, to Storm Shareholders, unanimously approved the Arrangement and the
entering into of the Arrangement Agreement and has resolved unanimously to
recommend Storm Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement. Notice of
such approvals, determinations and resolution shall, subject to the terms
hereof, be included, along with the written fairness opinion of
Storms financial advisor, confirming the aforementioned opinion of such
financial advisor, in the Information Circular.

  



  

 **2.11** ** ****Dissenting Shareholders**

  



  

Registered Storm Shareholders entitled to vote at the Storm Meeting may
exercise Dissent Rights with respect to their Storm Common Shares in
connection with the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner set forth in
the Plan of Arrangement. Storm shall give ARC prompt notice of any written
notice of a dissent, withdrawal of such notice, and any other instruments
served pursuant to such Dissent Rights and received by Storm and promptly
provide ARC with copies of such notices and written objections and all other
correspondence related thereto.

  



  

 **2.12** ** ****Tax Withholdings**

  



  

ARC and ARC Resources shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amount otherwise payable to any Storm Shareholder and, for greater certainty,
from any amount payable to a Storm Shareholder who has validly exercised, and
not withdrawn, Dissent Rights, as the case may be, under the Plan of
Arrangement such amounts as ARC or ARC Resources are required or reasonably
believed to be required to deduct and withhold from such consideration in
accordance with applicable tax laws. Any such amounts will be deducted and
withheld from the consideration payable pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement
and shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Storm
Shareholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate Taxing Authority.

  



  

 **2.13** ** ****Disclosure Letter**

ARC hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and punctual

 **2.17** ** ****Adjustments to ExploreCo Cash Amount and Surmont/McMurray
Distribution Amount**

  



  

(a) To the extent that at the Effective Date capital expenditures on the
ExploreCo Assets for the period from March 30, 2010 to the Effective Date
exceed $6.5 million (the amount by which actual capital expenditures exceed
$6.5 million referred to in this Section as the " **ExploreCo Asset Budget
Deficiency** ") then, without prejudice any other rights of ARC or ARC
Resources contained in this Agreement, ARC Resources in its sole discretion
may require that ExploreCo reimburse Storm for up to $5 million of the
ExploreCo Asset Budget Deficiency by reducing the ExploreCo Cash Amount
by such amount and ARC Resources in its sole discretion may require Storm
to reduce the Surmont/McMurray Distribution Amount by any remaining portion
of the ExploreCo Asset Budget Deficiency.

  



  

(b) To the extent that at the Effective Date capital expenditures on the
ExploreCo Assets for the period from March 30, 2010 to the Effective Date are
less than $6.5 million (the amount by which actual capital expenditures are
less than $6.5 million referred to in this Section as the " **ExploreCo Asset
Budget Surplus** ") then, without prejudice any other rights of Storm or
ExploreCo contained in this Agreement, Storm in its sole discretion may
require that Storm increase the ExploreCo Cash Amount by such amount.

  



  

(c) To the extent that at the Effective Date the Additional Cash Adjustment
Amount (as defined in Section 2.17(d) below) is a positive number then,

of: (i) $49.9 million; and (ii) the Additional Cash Adjustment Amount; and in
respect of any remaining portion of the Additional Cash Adjustment Amount,
ARC Resources in its sole discretion may require that the ExploreCo Cash

remaining portion of the Additional Cash Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(d) For the purpose of Section 2.17(c) above, the " **Additional Cash
Adjustment Amount** " means the sum, positive or negative, of the following

Arrangement (including the transfer of the ExploreCo Assets to ExploreCo)
excluding the proceeds from the exercise of Storm Options, excluding the
ExploreCo Cash Amount and excluding the Storm Transaction Costs less
$105 million; (ii) Storm Transaction Costs less $6.0 million; and (iii) 25%
of $191.5 million less 25% of Storms Tax Pools at June 30, 2010 after giving

Transaction has not been completed prior to the Effective Date)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the computation of the amounts in (i) to (iii)
shall be made based on the assumption that the Storm Production Partnership
and 1318640 Alberta Ltd. are not dissolved as part of the Arrangement.

representative retained by it) seeks to initiate such discussions or
negotiations with Storm that does not result from a breach of this Section
3.5 and, subject to execution of a confidentiality and standstill agreement
substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such
confidentiality agreement shall provide for disclosure thereof (along with
all information provided

case if, and only to the extent that:

  



  

(A) the third party has first made a written _bona fide_  Acquisition
Proposal which is a Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(B) prior to furnishing such information to or entering into or participating
in any such discussions or negotiations with such third party, Storm provides
prompt notice to ARC to the effect that it is furnishing information to or
entering into or participating in discussions or negotiations with such
Person together with a copy of the confidentiality agreement referenced above
and, if not previously provided to ARC, copies of all information provided to

information provided to such party and all other information reasonably

informed of the status and details of any such inquiry, offer or proposal and
answer ARCs questions with respect thereto; and

  



  

(vi) accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to implement a

recommendation, approval or implementation, the Storm Board of Directors
shall have concluded in good faith, after considering all proposals to adjust
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 3.5(d)
and after receiving the advice of outside counsel as reflected in minutes of
the Storm Board of Directors, that the taking of such action is necessary for
the Storm Board of Directors in discharge of its fiduciary duties under
applicable laws and Storm complies with its obligations set forth in Section
3.5(d) and terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(a)(iv)
and concurrently therewith pays the ARC Termination Fee to ARC.

  



  

(c) Storm shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify ARC (at

amendment thereto) or any request for non-public information relating to
Storm, its subsidiaries or assets, or any amendments to the foregoing. Such
notice shall include a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal (and any
amendment thereto) which has been received or, if no written Acquisition
Proposal has been received, a description of the material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the Person making any inquiry, proposal,
offer or request. Storm shall also provide such further and other details of
the Acquisition Proposal or any amendment thereto as ARC may reasonably
request. Storm shall keep ARC promptly and fully informed of the status,
including any change to material terms, of any Acquisition Proposal or any

(d) Storm shall give ARC, orally and in writing, at least two (2) Business
Days advance notice of any decision by the Storm Board of Directors to
accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to implement a Superior
Proposal, shall set out the Storms Board reasonable determination of the
financial value of the consideration offered by such third party to Storm
Shareholders under such Superior Proposal, which notice shall confirm that
the Storm Board of Directors has determined that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall identify the third party making the
Superior Proposal and provide a copy thereof and any amendments thereto.
During the two (2) Business Day period commencing on the delivery of such
notice, Storm agrees not to accept, recommend, approve or enter into any
agreement to implement such Superior Proposal and not to release the party
making the Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and shall not
withdraw, redefine, modify or change its recommendation in respect of the
Arrangement. In addition, during such two (2) Business Day period Storm
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good
faith with ARC and its financial and legal advisors to make such adjustments

  



        
   

  



  

in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would
enable ARC to proceed with the Arrangement as amended rather than the
Superior Proposal. In the event ARC proposes to amend this Agreement and the
Arrangement such that the Superior Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal
and so advises the Storm Board prior to the expiry of such two (2) Business
Day period, the Storm Board of Directors shall not accept, recommend, approve
or enter into any agreement to implement such Superior Proposal, shall not
release the party making the Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions
and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its recommendation in
respect of the Arrangement.

  



  

(e) Storm shall reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement by press
release promptly and in any event within five Business Days of any written
request to do so by ARC (or, in the event that the Storm Meeting to approve
the Arrangement is scheduled to occur within such five Business Day period,
prior to the scheduled date of such meeting) in the event that (i) any
Acquisition Proposal which is publicly announced is determined not to be a
Superior Proposal; or (ii) the Parties have entered into an amended agreement
pursuant to Section 3.5(d) which results in any Acquisition Proposal not
being a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(f) ARC agrees that all information that may be provided to it by Storm with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be
treated as if it were "Confidential Information" as that term is defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement and shall not be disclosed or used except
in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or in
order to enforce its rights under this Agreement in legal proceedings.

  



  

(g) Storm and ARC shall each ensure that their respective officers, directors
and employees and any investment bankers or other advisers or representatives
retained by it are aware of the provisions of this Section 3.5 and shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 3.5 by any of them.

  



  

(h) Nothing in this agreement shall prevent the Storm Board of Directors from
complying with Section 2.17 of Multilateral Instrument 62-104 and similar
provisions under Applicable Canadian Securities Laws relating to the
provision of directors circulars in respect of an Acquisition Proposal that
is not a Superior Proposal but only following Storms compliance
with Section 3.5(d).

owned and to carry on its business as now conducted. Each member of the ARC
Group is duly registered or authorized to conduct its affairs or do business,
as applicable, and each is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
character of its assets and properties, owned, leased, licensed or otherwise
held, or the nature of its activities makes such registration or

Adverse Effect on ARC.

has the requisite trust or corporate power and authority to execute this
Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by ARC and ARC Resources

by the ARC Board of Directors and, subject to obtaining the Final Order, no
other proceedings on the part of ARC or ARC Resources are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or the Arrangement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by ARC and ARC Resources and constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of ARC and ARC Resources enforceable

applicable to the ARC Parties or any of their properties or assets (except,
in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B) above, for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations of
encumbrances which, or any consents, approvals or notices which if not given

respective properties or assets at law or in equity or before or by any court
or Governmental Authority which claim, action, suit, proceeding,
investigation, arbitration, audit, grievance, assessment or reassessment
involves a possibility of any judgment against or liability of the ARC Group
which would reasonably be expected to cause, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Change to ARC or would significantly impede the
ability of the ARC Parties to consummate the Arrangement.

under any tax sharing, tax indemnity or tax allocation agreement or
arrangement or as a result of this transaction.

assessment or collection of a material amount of Taxes, nor, to the knowledge
of ARC, has such an event been asserted in writing by any Governmental
Authority or threatened against ARC or its subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect

  



        
   

  



  

on ARC. No waiver or extension of any statute of limitations is in effect
with respect to material Taxes or material Tax Returns of ARC or its

250,912,887 ARC Trust Units issued and outstanding and other than 865,901
Series A exchangeable shares of ARC Resources which are outstanding as of the
date hereof and other than pursuant to ARCs distribution reinvestment plan,
there are no options, warrants or other rights, plans agreements or

by ARC of any securities of ARC (including ARC Trust Units) or any securities
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, or otherwise evidencing
a right to acquire, any securities of ARC (including ARC Trust Units). All

pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Series A exchangeable shares of

(l) _Reports._ As of their respective dates: (i) the ARC Financial
Statements; (ii) ARCs statement of oil and gas reserves data and other oil
and gas information dated February 22, 2010 (the " **GLJ Report** ")
filed pursuant to National Instrument 51-101; (iii) ARCs information
circular dated March 23, 2010; and (iv) all ARC press releases,
material change reports and business acquisition reports filed with the
Securities Authorities since December 31, 2009; did not contain any
Misrepresentation and complied in all material respects with all Applicable
Laws. The ARC Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except (x) as otherwise indicated in such financial statements and the notes
thereto or, in the case of audited statements, in the related report of ARCs
independent auditors or (y) in the case of unaudited interim

  



        
   

  



  

statements, to the extent they may not include footnotes, are subject to
normal year end adjustments or may be condensed or summary statements), and

results of operations and changes in financial position of ARC on a

ARC accounting policies, except as described in the notes to the ARC
Financial Statements, since December 31, 2009.

  



  

(m) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Except as disclosed in the ARC
Public Record and expect for the Arrangement or any action taken
in accordance with this Agreement, since December 31, 2009:

  



  

(i) ARC has conducted its business only in the ordinary course of business
substantially consistent with past practice;

  



  

(ii) no liability or obligation of any nature (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) material to ARC has been incurred other than in the
ordinary course of business;

  



  

(iii) there has been no Material Adverse Change in respect of ARC; and

  



  

(iv) neither ARC nor any member of the ARC Group, and to the knowledge of
ARC, any director, officer, employee or auditor of ARC or any member of the
ARC Group, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any fraud
or material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding fraud or the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of ARC or any member of the ARC Group or their
respective internal accounting controls.

  



  

(n) _Registration, Exemption Orders, Licenses, etc._ To the knowledge of
ARC, ARC and each member of the ARC Group has obtained and is in compliance
with Governmental Authorizations, except where the failure to obtain or be
in compliance could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ARC. Such Governmental
Authorizations are in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice
or lapse of time) may constitute or result in a violation of any such
Governmental Authorization, except where the violation would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on ARC. No proceedings are pending or, to the knowledge of
ARC, threatened, which could result in the revocation or limitation of any
Governmental Authorization, and all steps have been taken and filings made on
a timely basis with respect to each Governmental Authorization and its
renewal, except where the failure to take such steps and make such filings
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on ARC.

  



  

(o) _Compliance with Laws._ The operations and business of each member of the
ARC Group is and has been carried out in compliance with and not in violation
of any Applicable Laws, other than non-compliance or violation which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on ARC or would significantly impact the ability of
the ARC Parties to consummate the Arrangement, and ARC has not received any
notice of any alleged violation of any such Applicable Laws other than where
such notice would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on ARC or would significantly impact the ability of the ARC Parties to
consummate the Arrangement.

  



  

(p) _Restrictions on Business Activities._ There is no judgment, injunction
or order binding upon any member of the ARC Group that has or could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting, restricting or
impairing its business or, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on ARC.

  



  

(q) _Non-Arm s Length Transactions._ There are no material Contracts or
other transactions currently in place between any member of the ARC Group, on
the one hand, and (i) any officer or director of a member of ARC, (ii)
any holder of record or beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting
securities of ARC or (iii) any affiliate of any such officer, director or
beneficial owner, on the other hand.

  



        
   

  



  

(r) _GLJ Report._ ARC has made available to Gilbert Laustsen Jung Associates
Ltd. (" **GLJ** "), prior to the issuance of GLJ Report, for the purpose
of preparing the GLJ Report, all information requested by GLJ, which
information did not contain any misrepresentation at the time such
information was provided. Except with respect to changes in the prices of oil
and gas, ARC has no knowledge of a material adverse change in any production,
reserves or other relevant information provided to GLJ since the date that
such information was provided. ARC believes that the GLJ Report reasonably
presents the quantity and pre-tax present worth values of the oil and natural
gas reserves attributable to the crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural
gas properties evaluated in such report as of its effective date based upon
information available at the time such reserves information was prepared, and
ARC believes that, at the date of such report, such report did not (and as of
the date hereof, except as may be attributable to production since the date
of such report does not) overstate the aggregate quantity or pre-tax present
worth values of such reserves or the estimated monthly production volumes
therefrom.

  



  

(s) _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities._ None of ARC or any of its
subsidiaries has any material liabilities of any nature (matured or
unmatured, fixed or contingent), other than:

  



  

(i) those set forth or adequately provided for in the most recent balance
sheet and associated notes thereto included in the ARC Financial Statements
(for the purposes of this Section, the " **ARC Balance Sheet** ");

  



  

(ii) those incurred in the ordinary course of business and not required to be
set forth in the ARC Balance Sheet under GAAP;

  



  

(iii) those incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the
ARC Balance Sheet and consistent with past practice; and

  



  

(iv) those incurred in connection with the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

(t) _Absence of undisclosed changes._ There has not been any material change
in the capital, assets, liabilities or obligations (absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) of ARC on a consolidated basis from the position set
forth in the Financial Statements (other than as have been disclosed in the
ARC Public Record) and ARC has not incurred or suffered a Material Adverse
Change since December 31, 2009 and since that date there have been no
material facts, transactions, events or occurrences which would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the capital, assets, liabilities or obligations
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of the operations of ARC (taken as a whole) which have
not been disclosed in the ARC Public Record.

  



  

(u) _No Defaults._ Neither ARC nor any member of the ARC Group is in default
under, and there exists no event, condition or occurrence which, after notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default under any contract,
agreement or licence to which it is a party or by which it is bound which
would, if terminated or upon exercise of a right made available to a third
party solely by a reason of such a default due to such default, individually
or in the aggregate, be material to ARC. Neither ARC nor any member of the
ARC Group is in violation of any Applicable Laws which violation could be
material to ARC.

  



  

(v) _Pre-emptive Rights._ ARC does not have any knowledge of any outstanding
rights of first refusal or other pre emptive rights of purchase which entitle
any person to acquire any of the rights, title, interests, property, licenses
or assets of ARC or any member of the ARC Group that will be triggered or
accelerated by the Arrangement, which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
ARC.

  



  

(w) _Environmental_.

  



  

Except to the extent that violations or other matters referred to in this
subparagraph do not have a Material Adverse Effect on ARC:

  



  

(i) ARC and the ARC Group are not in violation of any applicable
Environmental Laws;

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) ARC and each member of the ARC Group have operated its business at all
times and have received, handled, used, stored, treated, shipped and disposed
of all Hazardous Substances in compliance with Environmental Laws;

Hazardous Substances, or wastes into the earth, subsoil, underground waters,
air or into any body of water or any municipal or other sewer or drain water
systems by ARC or any member of the ARC Group, or on or underneath any
location which is or was currently or formerly owned, leased or otherwise
operated by ARC or any member of the ARC Group, that have not been fully
remediated;

  



  

(iv) no orders, directions or notices have been issued and remain outstanding
pursuant to any Environmental Laws relating to the business or assets of ARC
or any member of the ARC Group which ARC or any member of the ARC Group has

(v) neither ARC nor any member of the ARC Group has failed to report to the
proper Governmental Authority the occurrence of any event which is required
to be so reported by any Environmental Law;

expenditures are required to be made by it as a condition of continued
compliance with any Environmental Laws or Environmental Approvals, or that
any Environmental Approval referred to above is about to be reviewed, made
subject to limitation or conditions, revoked, withdrawn or terminated;

  



  

(vii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of ARC, threatened claims,
liens or encumbrances resulting from Environmental Laws with respect to any
of the properties of ARC or any member of the ARC Group currently or formerly

(viii) neither ARC nor any member of the ARC Group has assumed or retained by
contract or operation of law any losses, expenses, claims, damages or
liabilities of any third-party pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws.

  



  

(x) _Insurance._ Policies of insurance that are in force as of the date
hereof naming any member of the ARC Group as an insured adequately and
reasonably cover all risks as are customarily covered by oil and gas
producers in the industry in which the ARC Group operates and having regard
to the nature of the risk insured and the relative cost of obtaining
insurance protect such member of the ARC Groups interests. All such policies
shall remain in force and effect and shall not be cancelled or otherwise
terminated as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(y) _Board Approval._ The ARC Board of Directors has unanimously endorsed the
Arrangement and approved this Agreement.

  



  

(z) _Distributions._ With the exception of the distribution payable on June
15, 2010 to unitholders of ARC of record on May 31, 2010, all distributions
previously declared by ARC to be payable to ARCs unitholders have been paid
in full in accordance with such declarations.

(ii) no liability or obligation of any nature (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) material to Storm has been incurred other than in

(iii) there has been no Material Adverse Change in respect of Storm; and

or oral, regarding fraud or the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Storm or any member of the Storm Group or their
respective internal accounting controls.

  



  

(o) _Registration, Exemption Orders, Licenses, etc._ To the knowledge of
Storm, Storm and each member of the Storm Group has obtained and is in
compliance with all Governmental Authorizations, except where the failure to
obtain or be in compliance could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Storm. Such
Governmental Authorizations are in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or
without notice or lapse of time) may constitute or result in a violation of
any such Governmental Authorization, except where the violation would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Storm. No proceedings are pending or, to the knowledge of
Storm, threatened, which could result in the revocation or limitation of any
Governmental Authorization, and all steps have been taken and filings made on
a timely basis with respect to each Governmental Authorization and its
renewal, except where the failure to take such steps and make such filings
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Storm.

  



  

(p) _Compliance with Laws._ The operations and business of each member of the
Storm Group is and has been carried out in compliance with and not in
violation of any Applicable Laws, other than non-compliance or violation
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Storm or would significantly impact the
ability of the Storm Parties to consummate the Arrangement, and Storm has not
received any notice of any alleged violation of any such Applicable Laws
other than where such notice would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Storm or would significantly impact the ability of
the Storm Parties to consummate the Arrangement.

  



  

(q) _Restrictions on Business Activities._ There is no judgment, injunction
or order binding upon any member of the Storm Group that has or could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting, restricting or
impairing its business or, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Storm.

  



  

(r) _Non-Arm s Length Transactions._ There are no material Contracts or
other transactions currently in place between any member of the Storm Group,
on the one hand, and (i) any officer or director of a member of Storm, (ii)
any holder of record or beneficial owner of 10% or more of the
voting securities of Storm or (iii) any affiliate of any such officer,
director or beneficial owner, on the other hand.

  



  

(s) _Title._ Although it does not warrant title, Storm has no reason to
believe that Storm or its subsidiaries, other than ExploreCo for which no
representation and warranty is given, does not have title to or the right to
produce and sell their petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons (for
the purpose of this Section, the foregoing are referred to as the "
**Interests** ") and does represent and warrant that the Interests are free
and clear of adverse claims created by, through or under the Storm Group
(other than ExploreCo) except as disclosed in the Storm Public Record, any
governmental registry or those arising in the ordinary course of business
(including encumbrances ordinarily considered to be "permitted encumbrances"
in connection with oil and gas transactions in Western Canada, but not
including any gross overriding royalties which are not disclosed in the
Disclosure Letter and including those related to bank financings) and that,
to the best of its knowledge, information and belief, Storm holds the
Interests under valid and subsisting leases, licences, permits, concessions,
concession agreements, contracts, subleases, reservations or other
agreements, except where the failure to hold such rights in the event of such
adverse claims or the failure to so hold its Interest would, individually or
in the aggregate, not have a Material Adverse Effect on Storm.

  



  

(t) _Paddock Lindstrom Report._ Storm has made available to Paddock Lindstrom
and Associates Ltd. (" **Paddock Lindstrom** "), prior to the issuance of the
Paddock Lindstrom Report, for the purpose of preparing the Paddock Lindstrom
Report, all information requested by Paddock Lindstrom, which information did
not contain any misrepresentation at the time such information was provided.
Except with respect to changes in the prices of oil and gas, Storm has no
knowledge of a material adverse change in any production,

  



        
   

  



  

reserves or other relevant information provided to Paddock Lindstrom since
the date that such information was provided. Storm believes that the Paddock
Lindstrom Report reasonably presents the quantity and pretax present worth
values of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to the crude oil,
natural gas liquids and natural gas properties evaluated in such report as of
its effective date based upon information available at the time such reserves
information was prepared, and Storm believes that, at the date of such
report, such report did not (and as of the date hereof, except as may
be attributable to production since the date of such report does not)
overstate the aggregate quantity or pre-tax present worth values of such
reserves or the estimated monthly production volumes therefrom.

  



  

(u) _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities._ None of Storm or any of its
subsidiaries has any material liabilities of any nature (matured or
unmatured, fixed or contingent), other than:

  



  

(i) those set forth or adequately provided for in the most recent balance
sheet and associated notes thereto included in the Storm Financial Statements
(for the purposes of this Section, the " **Storm Balance Sheet** ");

  



  

(ii) those incurred in the ordinary course of business and not required to be
set forth in the Storm Balance Sheet under GAAP;

  



  

(iii) those incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the
Storm Balance Sheet and consistent with past practice; and

  



  

(iv) those incurred in connection with the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

(v) _Absence of undisclosed changes._ There has not been any material change
in the capital, assets, liabilities or obligations (absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) of Storm on a consolidated basis from the position
set forth in the Financial Statements (other than as have been disclosed in
the Storm Public Record) and Storm has not incurred or suffered a Material
Adverse Change since December 31, 2009 and since that date there have been no
material facts, transactions, events or occurrences which would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the capital, assets, liabilities or obligations
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of the operations of Storm (taken as a whole) which
have not been disclosed in the Storm Public Record.

  



  

(w) _No Defaults._ Neither Storm nor any member of the Storm Group is in
default under, and there exists no event, condition or occurrence which,
after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default under
any contract, agreement or licence to which it is a party or by which it is
bound which would, if terminated or upon exercise of a right made available
to a third party solely by a reason of such a default due to such default,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to Storm. Neither Storm nor any
member of the Storm Group is in violation of any Applicable Laws which
violation could be material to Storm.

  



  

(x) _Pre-emptive Rights._ Storm does not have any knowledge of any
outstanding rights of first refusal or other pre emptive rights of purchase
which entitle any person to acquire any of the rights, title, interests,
property, licenses or assets of Storm or any member of the Storm Group that
will be triggered or accelerated by the Arrangement, which would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Storm.

is bound and each of such contract and agreement constitutes a legally valid
and binding agreement of Storm or a member of the Storm Group, as applicable,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and, to the knowledge
of Storm, no party thereto is in default in the observance or performance of
any term or obligation to be performed by it under any such contract or
agreement which is material to the business of Storm (taken as a whole) and
no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time or both would
directly or indirectly constitute such a default, in any such case which
default or event would reasonably be expected to be material to the business
of Storm.

disclosed in the Disclosure Letter) true, complete and correct copies of each

issuance, sale or transfer by ExploreCo of any securities of ExploreCo or any
securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, or otherwise
evidencing a right to acquire, any securities of ExploreCo. All outstanding

conduct its affairs or do business, as applicable, and each is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of its assets and
properties, owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held or the nature of its

corporate power and authority to execute this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation by ExploreCo of the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement

executed and delivered by ExploreCo and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of ExploreCo enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and other Applicable Laws of general application relating to or affecting
rights of creditors and that equitable remedies, including specific
performance, are discretionary and may not be ordered.

The obligation of ARC and ARC Resources to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and in particular the Arrangement, is subject to the

extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date or,
with respect to all representations and warranties, except as affected by
transactions contemplated or permitted by this Agreement) except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct,

materially impede the ability of the Parties to complete the Arrangement and
each of Storm and ExploreCo shall have **** provided to ARC a certificate of

breach of ARCs covenants under this Agreement;

shall have been threatened or taken before or by any Governmental Authority
or by any elected or appointed public official or private Person in

  



        
   

  



  

Canada or elsewhere, whether or not having the force of law and no law,
regulation, policy, judgment, decision, order, ruling or directive (whether
or not having the force of law) shall have been proposed, enacted,
promulgated, amended or applied, which in the sole judgment of ARC, acting
reasonably, in either case has had or, if the Arrangement was consummated,
would result in a Material Adverse Effect on Storm or would materially impede
the ability of the Parties to complete the Arrangement.

  



  

(e) _No Material Adverse Change._ Between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, there shall not have occurred any Material Adverse Change with respect
to Storm.

  



  

(f) _Board and Shareholder Authorization._ Storm and ExploreCo shall have

the holders thereof in exchange for Storm Common Shares or terminated for
consideration of $0.01 per Storm Option as evidenced by a certificate from a
senior officer of Storm or ARC shall be otherwise satisfied, acting
reasonably, that the Storm Options will no longer represent any right to
acquire Storm Shares after giving affect to the Arrangement and that there
are no other outstanding claims or rights or securities which could become
claims or rights to Storm Common Shares.

  



  

(j) _Releases._ Executed releases in a form acceptable to ARC, acting
reasonably, shall have been received by ARC on or prior to the Effective Date
from each Person who is a director, officer or employee of Storm or a

 **5.3** ** ****Additional Conditions to Obligations of Storm**

  



  

The obligation of Storm to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
and in particular the Arrangement, is subject to the following conditions:

  



  

(a) _Representations and Warranties._ The representations and warranties of
ARC set forth herein shall be true and correct in all respects as of the
Effective Date as if made on and as of such date without giving effect to any
materiality qualifiers contained therein (except to the extent such
representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date or except as
affected by transactions contemplated or permitted by this Agreement), except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not, or would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change or have a Material Adverse
Effect on ARC or would not, or would not reasonably be expected to,
materially impede the ability of the Parties to complete the Arrangement, and
ARC shall have provided to Storm a certificate of a senior officer of ARC
Resources certifying such accuracy on the Effective Date.

  



  

(b) _Covenants._ The ARC Parties shall have complied in all material respects
with their respective covenants herein, except where the failure to comply in
all material respects with such covenants, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change or
have a Material Adverse Effect on ARC or would not, or would not reasonably
be expected to, materially impede the ability of the Parties to complete the
Arrangement and ARC shall have provided to Storm a certificate of a senior
officer of ARC Resources certifying compliance with such covenants; provided

(c) _No Actions._ No act, action, suit, proceeding, objection or opposition
shall have been threatened or taken before or by any Governmental Authority
or by any elected or appointed public official or private person in Canada or
elsewhere, whether or not having the force of law, and no law, regulation,
policy, judgment, decision, order, ruling or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) shall have been proposed, enacted, promulgated, amended or
applied, which in the sole judgment of Storm, acting reasonably, in either
case has had or, if the Arrangement was consummated, would result in, a
material adverse change in the affairs, operations or business of ARC or
would significantly impede the ability of the Parties to complete the
Arrangement.

  



  

(d) _Mailing Date._ The Mailing Date shall occur not later than August 31,
2010, provided the failure to mail by such date is not caused by a material
breach of Storms or ExploreCos covenants under this Agreement;

Time, there shall not have occurred any Material Adverse Change with respect
to ARC.

  



  

(f) _Board Authorization._ ARC and ARC Resources shall have each
furnished Storm with certified copies of the resolutions duly passed by the
ARC Board of Directors approving this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

The conditions in this Section 5.3 are for the exclusive benefit of Storm and
may be asserted by Storm regardless of the circumstances or may be waived by
Storm in its sole discretion, in whole or in part, at any time and from time
to time without prejudice to any other rights which Storm may have. If any of
the foregoing conditions are not satisfied or waived, Storm may, in addition
to any other remedies it may have at law or equity, terminate this Agreement
as provided in Section 9.1(a)(ii) (save and except for Article 6, Section 4.4
and Section 2.15 hereof which shall survive such termination and remain in
full force and effect).

  



  

 **5.4** ** ****Notice and Effect of Failure to Comply with Conditions**

  



  

Each of ARC and Storm shall give prompt notice to the other of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof to the
Effective Date of any event or state of facts which occurrence or

  



        
   

  



  

failure would, or would be likely to: (i) cause any of the representations or
warranties of such Party contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect; or (ii) result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any
Party hereunder; provided, however, that no such notification will affect the
representations or warranties of the Parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties hereunder.

  



  

 **5.5** ** ****Satisfaction of Conditions**

  



  

The conditions set out in this Article 5 are conclusively deemed to have been
satisfied, waived or released when, with the agreement of the Parties,
Articles of Arrangement are filed under the CBCA to give effect to the
Arrangement.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 6**

  

 **AGREEMENT AS TO DAMAGES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS**

  



  

 **6.1** ** ****ARC Damages**

  



  

If at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to its
termination:

  



  

(a) the Storm Board of Directors withdraws, amends, changes or qualifies, or
proposes publicly to withdraw, amend, change or qualify, in any manner
adverse to ARC, any of its recommendations or determinations referred to in
Section 2.10;

  



  

(b) the Storm Board of Directors shall have failed to publicly reaffirm any
of its recommendations or determinations referred to in Section 2.10 in
accordance with Section 3.5(e) or within five Business Days of any written
request to do so by ARC (or, in the event that the Storm Meeting to approve
the Arrangement is scheduled to occur within such five Business Day period,
prior to the scheduled date of such meeting);

  



  

(c) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, proposed,
offered or made to the Storm Shareholders or to Storm and has not expired or
been withdrawn at the time of the Storm Meeting, and the Storm Shareholders
do not approve the Arrangement or the Arrangement is not submitted for their
approval;

  



  

(d) the Storm Board of Directors or any committees of the Storm Board of
Directors accepts, recommends, approves or enters into an agreement **,**
understanding or letter of intent to implement a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(e) Storm or ExploreCo is in breach of any of its covenants made in this
Agreement which breach individually or in the aggregate causes or would
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to, or
Material Adverse Effect on, Storm or materially impedes or would reasonably
be expected to materially impede the completion of the Arrangement, and Storm
or ExploreCo, as the case may be, fails to cure such breach within five
Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof from ARC (except that
no cure period shall be provided for a breach which by its nature cannot be
cured and, in no event, shall any cure period extend beyond the Outside
Date); or

  



  

(f) Storm or ExploreCo is in breach of any of its representations or
warranties made in this Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality
qualifiers contained therein) which breach individually or in the aggregate
causes or would reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change
with respect to, or have a Material Adverse Effect on, Storm or materially
impedes or would reasonably be expected to materially impede the completion
of the Arrangement, and Storm or ExploreCo fails to cure such breach within
five Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof from ARC (except
that no cure period shall be provided for a breach which by its nature cannot
be cured and, in no event, shall any cure period extend beyond the Outside
Date);

  



        
   

  



  

each of the above being a " **ARC Damages Event** " **,** then in the event
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 9, Storm shall pay
to ARC Resources (or to whom ARC Resources may direct in writing) $21 million
(the " **ARC Termination Fee** ") as liquidated damages in immediately
available funds to an account designated by ARC within one Business Day after
the first to occur of the events described above. Following an ARC Damages
Event, but prior to payment of the ARC Termination Fee, Storm shall be deemed
to hold such applicable payment in trust for ARC. Storm and ExploreCo
together shall only be obligated to make one payment pursuant to this Section
6.1.

  



  

 **6.2** ** ****ARC Liquidated Damages**

  



  

Each Party acknowledges that the ARC Termination Fee set out in Section 6.1
is a payment of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the
damages which ARC will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise
to such damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement and is not a
penalty. Storm irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence
that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater
certainty, the Parties that the payment of the amount pursuant to Section 6.1
is the sole monetary remedy of ARC; provided, however, that this limitation
shall not apply in the event of fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement
by Storm or ExploreCo. Nothing herein shall preclude a Party from seeking
injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such act,
covenants or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in
connection therewith.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 7**

  

 **INDEMNITY**

  



  

 **7.1** ** ****Indemnified Liabilities**

  



  

The Storm ExploreCo Conveyance Agreement and/or other agreement(s) entered
into pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
provide that from the Effective Time, ExploreCo will agree to indemnify and
save harmless ARC, ARC Resources, Storm and its subsidiaries from all losses
suffered or incurred by ARC, ARC Resources, Storm or its subsidiaries as a
result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with the
Indemnified Liabilities.

  



  

 **7.2** ** ****Indemnified Claims**

  



  

The Storm ExploreCo Conveyance Agreement and/or other agreement(s) entered
into pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
provide that if any claim, proceeding or other matter resulting from the
occurrence of any of the events contemplated by Section 7.1 above (a "
**Claim** ") is made against ARC, ARC Resources, Storm or any of its
subsidiaries by a third party for which ARC, ARC Resources, Storm or any of
their respective subsidiaries may be entitled to indemnification, ARC or ARC
Resources or Storm or their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, shall
give notice (the " **Indemnity Notice** ") to ExploreCo specifying the
particulars of such Claim within 20 days after it receives notification
of the Claim. ExploreCo shall have the right to participate in any
negotiations or proceedings with respect to such Claim. Furthermore, ARC, ARC
Resources, Storm or its subsidiaries, as applicable, shall not settle or
compromise any such Claim without the prior written consent of ExploreCo,
unless ExploreCo has not, within 20 Business Days after the giving of the
Indemnity Notice, given notice to ARC, ARC Resources, Storm or its
subsidiaries, as applicable, that it wishes to dispute such Claim. If

 **ARTICLE 4 
 DISSENTING STORM SHAREHOLDERS**

  



  

4.1 Each registered Storm Shareholder shall have the right to dissent with
respect to the Arrangement, in the same manner as provided for in Section 190
of the CBCA, but as modified by the terms of this Plan of Arrangement and the
Interim Order. A Dissenting Shareholder shall, immediately after the step
contemplated in Section 3.1(b), cease to have any rights as a Storm
Shareholder and shall only be entitled to be paid by Storm the fair value of
such Dissenting Shareholders Storm Shares under the Arrangement. The fair
value of the Storm Shares shall be determined in relation to the value of
Storm Shares as of the close of business on the last Business Day before the
day on which the Arrangement is approved by the Storm Shareholder at the
Meeting. A Dissenting Shareholder who is paid the fair value for its Storm
Shares shall be deemed to have transferred its Storm Shares to Storm and such
Storm Shares so transferred shall be cancelled in accordance with this Plan
of Arrangement. A Dissenting Shareholder who for any reason is not entitled
to be paid the fair value for its Storm Shares shall be treated as if such
Dissenting Shareholder had participated in the Arrangement on the same basis
as a non-dissenting holder of Storm Shares. In no event shall Storm or any
other Person be required to recognize a Dissenting Shareholder as a
shareholder of Storm after the cancellation of the Storm Shares pursuant to
Section 3.1(b). For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions
in Section 190 of the CBCA no Person who has voted in favour of the
Arrangement shall be entitled to dissent with respect to the Arrangement.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 5 
 OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SECURITIES**

  



  

5.1 From and after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing
Storm Shares and Storm New Common Shares acquired by ARC Resources under the
Arrangement shall represent only the right to receive the consideration to
which the holders are entitled under the Arrangement.

  



  

5.2 ARC, ARC Resources and ExploreCo shall, as soon as practicable following
the later of the Effective Date and the date of deposit by a former holder of
Storm Shares of a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and the certificates
representing such Storm Shares, either:

  



  

(a) forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage prepaid) to
such former holder at the address specified in the Letter of Transmittal; or

  



  

(b) if requested by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, make available
or cause to be made available at the Depositary for pickup by such holder,

  



        
   

  



  

certificates representing the number of ExploreCo Shares, ExploreCo Warrants,
Exchangeable Shares and/or ARC Trust Units issued to such holder and/or the
amount of cash payable under and in accordance with the Arrangement.

  



  

5.3 If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented an interest in outstanding Storm Shares that were exchanged
pursuant to Section 3.1 has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue and deliver in
exchange for such lost stolen or destroyed certificate the consideration to
which the holder is entitled pursuant to the Arrangement (and any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) as determined in accordance with the
Arrangement. The person who is entitled to receive such consideration shall,
as a condition precedent to the receipt thereof, give a bond to each of ARC,
ARC Resources and ExploreCo and their respective transfer agents, which bond
is in form and substance satisfactory to each of ARC, ARC Resources and
ExploreCo and their respective transfer agents, or shall otherwise indemnify
ARC, ARC Resources and ExploreCo and their respective transfer agents against
any claim that may be made against any of them with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

5.4 All distributions made with respect to any ARC Trust Units allotted and
issued pursuant to this Arrangement but for which a certificate has not been
issued shall be paid or delivered to the Depositary to be held by the
Depositary in trust for the registered holder thereof. All monies received by
the Depositary shall be invested by it in interest-bearing trust accounts
upon such terms as the Depositary may reasonably deem appropriate. The
Depositary shall pay and deliver to any such registered holder, as soon as
reasonably practicable after application therefor is made by the registered
holder to the Depositary in such form as the Depositary may reasonably
require, such distributions and any interest thereon to which such holder, is
entitled, net of applicable withholding and other taxes.

  



  

5.5 Any certificate formerly representing Storm Shares that is not deposited
with all other documents as required by this Plan of Arrangement on or before
the last business day prior to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date
shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and the right
of the holder of such Storm Shares to receive the certificates representing:
(i) the ExploreCo Shares; (ii) Exchangeable Shares; and/or (iii) ARC Trust
Units; and (iv) in the event the Surmont/McMurray Transaction closes prior to
the Effective Time, cash.

  



  

5.6 No certificates representing fractional ARC Trust Units, Exchangeable
Shares, ExploreCo Shares or ExploreCo Warrants shall be issued upon the
exchange of the Storm Shares or Storm New Common Shares for ARC Trust Units
or Exchangeable Shares, the exchange of Warrant Notes for ExploreCo Warrants
and the exchange of ExploreCo Notes for ExploreCo Shares. In lieu of any
fractional ARC Trust Unit, ExploreCo Warrant, Exchangeable Share, or
ExploreCo Share, each registered Storm Shareholder otherwise entitled to a
fractional interest in an ARC Trust Unit, Exchangeable Share, ExploreCo Share
or ExploreCo Warrant will receive the nearest whole number of ARC Trust
Units, Exchangeable Shares, ExploreCo Shares or ExploreCo Warrants, as the
case may be.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 6 
 AMENDMENTS**

  



  

6.1 ARC, Storm, ExploreCo and ARC Resources may amend, modify and/or
supplement this Plan of Arrangement at any time and from time to time prior
to the Effective Time, provided that each such amendment, modification and/or
supplement must be: (i) set out in writing; (ii) approved by

  



        
   

  



  

the other parties; (iii) filed with the Court and, if made following the
Meeting, approved by the Court; and (iv) communicated to holders of Storm
Shares, if and as required by the Court.

  



  

6.2 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may
be proposed by ARC, Storm, ExploreCo or ARC Resources at any time prior to or
at the Meeting (provided that the other parties shall have consented thereto)
with or without any other prior notice or communication, and if so proposed
and accepted by the persons voting at the Meeting (other than as may be
required under the Interim Order), shall become part of this Plan of
Arrangement for all purposes.

  



  

6.3 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement
that is approved by the Court following the Meeting shall be effective only
if it is consented to by each of ARC, Storm, ExploreCo and ARC Resources.

  



  

6.4 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may
be made following the Effective Time unilaterally by Storm, provided that it
concerns a matter which, in the reasonable opinion of Storm, is of an
administrative nature required to better give effect to the implementation of
this Plan of Arrangement and is not adverse to the financial or economic
interests of Storm, ARC or any former holder of Storm Shares.

Subco has exercised the Retraction Call Right, a holder of Exchangeable
Shares shall be entitled at any time, upon compliance with the provisions of
this Article 4, to require the Corporation to redeem any or all of
the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount
per share (the " **Retraction Price** ") equal to the amount determined by
multiplying the Exchange Ratio on the last Business Day prior to the
Retraction Date by the Current Market Price of an ARC Energy Unit on the last
Business Day prior to the Retraction Date, which payment of the Retraction
Price shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation delivering or causing to
be delivered to such holder that number of ARC Energy Units equal to the
Exchange Ratio as at the last Business Day prior to Retraction Date in
accordance with Section 4.2 of these share provisions, for each Exchangeable
Share presented and surrendered by the holder. To effect such redemption, the
holder shall present and surrender to the Corporation at the principal office
of the Transfer Agent in Toronto or Calgary or at such other address as may
be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable
Shares from time to time the certificate or certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem,
together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to
effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the by-laws of the
Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer
Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, and together with a duly
executed statement (the " **Retraction Request** ") in the form of Schedule A
hereto or in such other form as may be acceptable to the Corporation:

  



  

(a) specifying that the holder desires to have all or any number specified
therein of the Exchangeable Shares represented by such certificate or
certificates (the " **Retracted Shares** ") redeemed by the Corporation; and

  



  

(b) appointing the Corporation as its agent for the purpose of offering its
Retracted Shares for sale to ARC Energy Trust and ARC Subco (the "
**Retraction Offer** ") on the terms and conditions set out in Section
4.3 below (ARC Energy Trusts and ARC Subcos right to accept the Retraction
Offer and to complete the purchase of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the
Retraction Offer is referred to as the " **Retraction Call Right** ").

  



        
   

  



  

4.2 Subject to the exercise by ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco of the
Retraction Call Right, upon receipt by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent
in the manner specified in Section 4.1 hereof of documents including, without
limitation, a certificate or certificates representing the number of
Retracted Shares, together with a Retraction Request, and provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 4.7, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at
the close of business on the Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered
to such holder the Retraction Price. If only a part of the Exchangeable
Shares represented by any certificate is redeemed (or purchased by ARC Energy
Trust or ARC Subco pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), a new certificate
for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at
the expense of the Corporation.

  



  

4.3 ARC Subco shall only be entitled to exercise its Retraction Call Right
with respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which ARC
Energy Trust has not exercised its Retraction Call Right. Upon receipt by the
Corporation of a Retraction Request, the Corporation shall immediately
provide to ARC Energy Trust and ARC Subco a copy of the Retraction Request
and, as agent for the holder who submitted the Retraction Request, shall be
deemed to have made the Retraction Offer to ARC Energy Trust and ARC Subco in
respect of the holders Retracted Shares by providing to ARC Energy Trust and
ARC Subco a copy of the Retraction Request as aforesaid. In order to exercise
the Retraction Call Right and accept the Retraction Offer, ARC Energy Trust
or ARC Subco must notify the Corporation of its determination to do so (the "
**Call Notice** ") on or before 4:30 p.m. (Calgary time) on the date of
notification to ARC Energy Trust and ARC Subco by the Corporation of the
receipt by the Corporation of the Retraction Request. If ARC Energy Trust or
ARC Subco does not so notify the Corporation on or before 4:30 p.m. (Calgary
time) on the date of notification by the Corporation of the receipt by the
Corporation of the Retraction Request, the Corporation will notify the holder
as soon as possible thereafter that neither ARC Energy Trust nor ARC Subco
will exercise the Retraction Call Right and accept the Retraction Offer. If
ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco delivers the Call Notice on or before 4:30 p.m.
(Calgary time) on the date of notification by the Corporation of the receipt
by the Corporation of the Retraction Request and provided that the Retraction
Offer is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 4.7,
the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered only the Retraction
Offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to ARC Energy Trust or ARC
Subco, as applicable (in this Article 4, the " **RCR Exercising Party** "),
and all other aspects of the Retraction Request will be null and void. In
such event, the Corporation shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and the RCR
Exercising Party shall purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell
to the RCR Exercising Party on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares for
an amount per share (the " **Purchase Price** ") equal to the Retraction
Price, which payment of the Purchase Price shall be satisfied in full by the
RCR Exercising Party delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder
that number of ARC Energy Units equal to the Exchange Ratio as at the last
Business Day prior to the Retraction Date for each Retracted Share. To the
extent that the RCR Exercising Party pays the Purchase Price in respect
of the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall no longer be obligated to pay
any amount in respect of the Retraction Price for such Retracted Shares.
Provided that the RCR Exercising Party has complied with Section 4.4, the
closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the
Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as at the close of
business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no redemption by
the Corporation of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction
Date. In the event that neither ARC Energy Trust nor ARC Subco delivers a
Call Notice within the time required for the exercise of the Retraction Call
Right as set forth above, and provided that the Retraction Request is not
revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 4.7, the Corporation
shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the Retraction Date and in the manner
otherwise contemplated in this Article 4.

  



  

4.4 The Corporation, ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco, as the case may be, shall
deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the
address of the holder recorded in the register of shareholders of the
Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified in the
holders

  



        
   

  



  

Retraction Request, or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the office of
the Transfer Agent specified in the holders Retraction Request, certificates
representing the ARC Energy Units (which securities shall be duly issued as
fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim
or encumbrance) registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as
the holder may request in payment of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, in each case less any amounts withheld on
account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom, and such
delivery of such certificates by or on behalf of the Corporation, ARC Energy
Trust or ARC Subco, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be
deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the
total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be,
to the extent that the same is represented by such certificates (plus any
tax deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to the proper tax
authority).

  



  

4.5 On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of
the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect
thereof, other than: (i) the right to receive his proportionate part of the
total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be,
unless upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall not be made as provided in Section
4.4, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until
the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be,
has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided; and (ii) the right to
receive any declared and unpaid dividends on the Retracted Shares. On and
after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that
presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the total
Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been
made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted
Shares so redeemed by the Corporation or purchased by ARC Energy Trust or ARC
Subco shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a
holder of the ARC Energy Units delivered to it.

  



  

4.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 4, the Corporation
shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares
would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable
law. If the Corporation believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be
permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered
for redemption on such date, and provided that neither ARC Energy Trust nor
ARC Subco shall have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the
Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted
Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent of the
maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of
shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and shall notify the
holder and the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the Retraction
Date as to the number of Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by the
Corporation. In any case in which the redemption by the Corporation of
Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other
provisions of applicable law, the Corporation shall redeem Retracted Shares
in accordance with Section 4.2 of these share provisions on a pro rata basis
and shall issue to each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at the
expense of the Corporation, representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by
the Corporation pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof. Provided that the Retraction
Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 4.7,
the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation
pursuant to Section 4.2 of these share provisions as a result of solvency
requirements or other provisions of applicable law shall be deemed by giving
the Retraction Request to have exercised the Exchange Rights so as to require
ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco to purchase such Retracted Shares from such
holder on the Retraction Date or as soon as practicable thereafter on payment
by ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco to such holder of the Purchase Price for
each such Retracted Share, all as more specifically provided in the Voting
and Exchange Trust Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

4.7 A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the
holder to the Corporation before the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Retraction Date, revoke its Retraction Request or
Retraction Offer, as applicable, in which event such Retraction Request or
Retraction Offer shall be null and void

  



  

 **ARTICLE 5 
 REDEMPTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY THE CORPORATION**

  



  

5.1 Subject to applicable law, and provided neither ARC Energy Trust nor ARC
Subco has exercised the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation:

  



  

(a) shall, on the Automatic Redemption Date, redeem all but not less than all
of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares for the Redemption Price (such
redemption being an " **Automatic Redemption** ");

  



  

(b) may, on any Optional Redemption Date, redeem all but not less than all of
the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares (such redemption being an "
**Optional Redemption** "); and

  



  

(c) may, on any date when the aggregate number of issued and outstanding
Exchangeable Shares is less than **[100,000]** (such redemption date being
the " **De Minimus Redemption Date** "), redeem all but not less than all of
the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares for the Redemption Price (such
redemption being a " **De Minimus Redemption** ");

  



  

such payment of the Redemption Price per Exchangeable Share to be satisfied
in full in all cases by the Corporation delivering or causing to be
delivered, at the election of the Corporation, either that number of ARC
Energy Units equal to the Exchange Ratio as at the last Business Day prior to
the applicable Redemption Date or an amount in cash equal to the Redemption
Price, in accordance with Section 5.3 of these share provisions.

  



  

5.2 In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 5,
the Corporation shall, at least 90 days before the applicable Redemption
Date, send or cause to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares a notice
in writing of the redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by ARC Energy
Trust or ARC Subco under the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be, of
the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. Such notice shall set out the
formula for determining the Redemption Price, the Redemption Date and, if
applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right. The accidental failure
or omission to give any notice of redemption under this Section 5.2 to less
than 10% of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than ARC Energy Trust
and ARC Subco) shall not affect the validity of any redemption of
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to such notice.

  



  

5.3 On or after the applicable Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by
ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco of the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price for each such Exchangeable Share
upon presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such
Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as
may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and
the by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments
as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, at the
registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent
as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice. Payment of the total
Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares, shall be made by delivery to
each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the register of holders
of the Exchangeable Shares maintained by or on behalf of the Corporation or
by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered

  



        
   

  



  

office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Corporation in such notice, on behalf of the Corporation, of
certificates representing ARC Energy Units (which securities shall be
duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of
any lien, claim or encumbrance), or, if applicable, a cheque of the
Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation,
in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be
deducted and withheld therefrom. On and after the applicable Redemption Date,
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to
be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise
any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than: (i) the right to
receive their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price, unless
payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall not
be made upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with
the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall
remain unaffected until the total Redemption Price has been paid in the
manner hereinbefore provided; and (ii) the right to receive any declared and
unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Shares.

  



  

5.4 The Corporation shall have the right at any time after the sending of
notice of its intention to redeem the Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to
deposit or cause to be deposited the total Redemption Price for the
Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, or of such of the said
Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of
such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with such
redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company
in Canada named in such notice, less any amounts withheld on account of tax
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. Upon the later of such
deposit being made and the applicable Redemption Date, the Exchangeable
Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed
and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or that Redemption
Date, as the case may be, shall be limited to: (i) receiving their
proportionate part of the total Redemption Price (in each case less any
amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom) for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation
and surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in
accordance with the foregoing provisions; and (ii) receiving any declared and
unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Shares. Upon such payment or deposit of
the total Redemption Price, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares that have
been so redeemed shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes
to be holders of the ARC Energy Units or to have had cash delivered to them
or the custodian on their behalf; as applicable.

  



  

5.5 Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.6 of these share
provisions, the Corporation is appointed as agent for the holders of
Exchangeable Shares for the purpose of offering to ARC Energy Trust and ARC
Subco (the " **Redemption Offer** ") the overriding right (ARC Energy Trusts
and ARC Subcos right to accept the Redemption Offer and complete the
purchase of the Exchangeable Shares is referred to as the " **Redemption Call
Right** "), in the event of any proposed redemption of Exchangeable Shares by
the Corporation pursuant to this Article 5, to purchase from all but not less
than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than ARC Energy Trust
or ARC Subco) on the applicable Redemption Date all but not less than all of
the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder, in the case of an Automatic
Redemption, an Optional Redemption or a De Minimus Redemption, on payment by
whichever of ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco is exercising such right (in this
Article 5, the " **RCR Exercising Party** ") to each such holder of an amount
per Exchangeable Share equal to the Redemption Price, which payment of the
Redemption Price shall be satisfied in full by the RCR Exercising Party
delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder, at the election of the
RCR Exercising Party, either that number of ARC Energy Units equal to the
Exchange Ratio as at the last Business Day prior to the applicable Redemption
Date or an amount in cash equal to the Redemption Price, in accordance with
Section 5.7 of these share provisions. In the case of a redemption of
Exchangeable Shares under this Article 5, the Corporation, as agent for the
holders of Exchangeable Shares, shall make the Redemption Offer to ARC Energy
Trust and ARC Subco by sending or causing to be sent to ARC Energy Trust and
ARC Subco a notice in writing of the redemption by the Corporation of the
Exchangeable Shares. In the

  



        
   

  



  

event of the exercise of the Redemption Call Right and the acceptance of the
Redemption Offer, each holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to
sell all of the Exchangeable Shares held by that holder to the RCR Exercising
Party on the applicable Redemption Date on payment by the RCR Exercising
Party to such holder of the Redemption Price for each such share, and the
Corporation shall have no obligation to redeem, or to pay any amount
in respect of, such shares so purchased by the RCR Exercising Party.

  



  

5.6 ARC Subco shall only be entitled to exercise its Redemption Call Right
with respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which ARC
Energy Trust has not exercised its Redemption Call Right. To exercise the
Redemption Call Right and accept the Redemption Offer, the RCR Exercising
Party must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders of
Exchangeable Shares, and the Corporation of its intention to exercise such
right (and accept such offer) at least 60 days before the applicable
Redemption Date. The Corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent to notify the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not ARC Energy Trust or
ARC Subco has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry
of the period during which such right may be exercised. If an RCR Exercising
Party exercises its Redemption Call Right, such RCR Exercising Party shall on
the applicable Redemption Date purchase, and each of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares will sell, all of the Exchangeable Shares
then outstanding for a price per Exchangeable Share equal to the Redemption
Price.

  



  

5.7 For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares
pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, the RCR Exercising Party shall deposit
with the Transfer Agent, on or before the applicable Redemption Date,
certificates representing the aggregate number of ARC Energy Units
deliverable by the RCR Exercising Party (which securities shall be duly
issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any
lien, claim or encumbrance) or, if applicable, a cheque of the RCR Exercising
Party payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the RCR Exercising Party
in payment of the total Redemption Price, in each case less any amounts
withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom.
Provided that the total Redemption Price has been so deposited with the
Transfer Agent, on and after the applicable Redemption Date the rights of
each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than ARC Energy Trust and ARC
Subco) shall be limited to: (i) receiving such holders proportionate part of
the total Redemption Price payable by the RCR Exercising Party upon
presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after
that Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the
holder of the ARC Energy Units to which it is entitled; and (ii) receiving
any declared and unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Shares. Upon surrender
to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing
Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as
may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and
the by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments
as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, the holder
of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, and the Corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent on
behalf of the RCR Exercising Party to deliver to such holder, certificates
representing the ARC Energy Units to which the holder is entitled or a cheque
of the RCR Exercising Party payable at par at any branch of the bankers of
the RCR Exercising Party, of the total Redemption Price, less any amounts
withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. If
neither ARC Energy Trust nor ARC Subco exercises the Redemption Call Right in
the manner described above, on the applicable Redemption Date the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Redemption Price otherwise payable by the Corporation in connection with the
redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 5.1 of these share
provisions.

 **ARTICLE 6 
 DISTRIBUTION ON LIQUIDATION**

  



  

6.1 In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Corporation or any other distribution of the assets of the Corporation among
its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of
Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive
from the assets of the Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable Share held
by such holder on the effective date (the " **Liquidation Date** ") of
such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before any distribution of any
part of the assets of the Corporation among the holders of the Common Shares,
the Second Preferred Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the
Exchangeable Shares, an amount per share (the " **Liquidation Amount** ")
equal to the amount determined by multiplying the Exchange Ratio on the last
Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date by the Current Market Price of an
ARC Energy Unit on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which
payment of the Liquidation Amount shall be satisfied in full by the
Corporation delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder that number
of ARC Energy Units equal to the Exchange Ratio as at the last Business Day
prior to the Liquidation Date, in accordance with Section 6.2 of these share
provisions.

  



  

6.2 On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the exercise by
ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco of the Liquidation Call Right, the Corporation
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable Share upon
presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such Exchangeable
Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required
to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the by-laws of
the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer
Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, at the registered office of
the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by
the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment
of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall be made by
delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the
register of holders of the Exchangeable Shares maintained by or on behalf of
the Corporation or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered
office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares,
on behalf of the Corporation, of certificates representing ARC Energy Units
(which securities shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and
shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), less any amounts
withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. On
and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall
cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than: (i) the
right to receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount,
unless payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares
shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of certificates in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the
holders shall remain unaffected until the total Liquidation Amount has been
paid in the manner hereinbefore provided; and (ii) the right to receive any
declared and unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Shares.

  



  

6.3 The Corporation shall have the right at any time after the Liquidation
Date to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Liquidation Amount in
respect of the Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not
at the Liquidation Date been surrendered by the holders thereof in a
custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada, less
any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom. Upon such deposit being made, the rights of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be limited to: (i) receiving
their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount (less any amounts
withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom)
for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender
of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the
foregoing provisions; and (ii) receiving any declared and unpaid dividends on
such Exchangeable Shares. Upon such payment or deposit of the

  



        
   

  



  

total Liquidation Amount, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of
the ARC Energy Units delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.

  



  

6.4 After the Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the holders of
the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share
pursuant to Section 6.1 of these share provisions, such holders shall not be
entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of the
Corporation.

  



  

6.5 Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.6 of these share
provisions, the Corporation is appointed as agent for the holders of
Exchangeable Shares for the purpose of offering to ARC Energy Trust and ARC
Subco (the " **Liquidation Offer** ") the overriding right (ARC Energy
Trusts and ARC Subcos right to accept the Liquidation Offer and complete
the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares is referred to as the " **Liquidation
Call Right** "), in the event of and notwithstanding any proposed
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or any other
distribution of the assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding up its affairs, to purchase from all but not less than all
of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than ARC Energy Trust or ARC
Subco) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable
Shares held by each such holder, on payment by whichever of ARC Energy Trust
or ARC Subco is exercising such right (in this Article 6, the " **LCR
Exercising Party** ") to each such holder of an amount per Exchangeable Share
equal to the Liquidation Amount, which shall be satisfied in full by the LCR
Exercising Party delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder that
number of ARC Energy Units equal to the Exchange Ratio as at the last
Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, in accordance with Section 6.7 of
these share provisions. In the event of the exercise of the Liquidation Call
Right and the acceptance of the Liquidation Offer, each holder of
Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to sell all of the Exchangeable Shares
held by that holder to the LCR Exercising Party on the Liquidation Date on
payment by the LCR Exercising Party to such holder of the Liquidation Amount
for each such share, and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay any
amount on account of the Liquidation Amount in respect of such shares so
purchased by the LCR Exercising Party.

  



  

6.6 ARC Subco shall only be entitled to exercise its Liquidation Call Right
with respect to those Exchangeable Shares, if any, in respect of which ARC
Energy Trust has not exercised its Liquidation Call Right. In the event of
any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or any
other distribution of the assets of the Corporation among its shareholders
for the purpose of winding-up its affairs, the Corporation, as agent for the
holders of Exchangeable Shares, shall make the Liquidation Offer by sending
or causing to be sent to ARC Energy Trust and ARC Subco a notice in writing
of the Liquidation Offer. To exercise the Liquidation Call Right and accept
the Liquidation Offer, the LCR Exercising Party must notify the Transfer
Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and the Corporation
of its intention to exercise such right (and accept such offer) at least 30
days before the Liquidation Date, in the case of a voluntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, and at least five Business Days
before the Liquidation Date, in the case of an involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation. The Corporation shall cause the
Transfer Agent to notify the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether
or not ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco has exercised the Liquidation Call Right
forthwith after the expiry of the period during which such right may be
exercised. If an LCR Exercising Party exercises its Liquidation Call Right,
such LCR Exercising Party will on the Liquidation Date purchase, and each of
the holders of Exchangeable Shares will sell, all of the Exchangeable Shares
then outstanding for a price per Exchangeable Share equal to the Liquidation
Amount.

  



  

6.7 For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares
pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, the LCR Exercising Party shall
deposit with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date,
certificates representing the aggregate number of ARC Energy Units
deliverable by the

  



        
   

  



  

LCR Exercising Party (which securities shall be duly issued as fully paid and
non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim
or encumbrance), in payment of the total Liquidation Amount, less any
amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom. Provided that the total Liquidation Amount has been so deposited
with the Transfer Agent, on and after the Liquidation Date the rights of each
holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than ARC Energy Trust and ARC Subco)
shall be limited to: (i) receiving such holders proportionate share of the
total Liquidation Amount payable by the LCR Exercising Party upon
presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the

of the ARC Energy Units to which it is entitled; and (ii) receiving any
declared and unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Shares. Upon surrender to
the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable
Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required
to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the by-laws of
the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer
Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or
certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the
Corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent on behalf of the LCR Exercising
Party to deliver to such holder, certificates representing the ARC Energy
Units to which the holder is entitled, less any amounts withheld on account
of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. If neither ARC Energy
Trust nor ARC Subco exercises the Liquidation Call Right in the manner
described above, on the Liquidation Date the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Liquidation
Amount otherwise payable by the Corporation in connection with the
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation pursuant to Section
6.1 of these share provisions.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 7 
 CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS**

approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in
Section 10.2 of these share provisions:

  



  

(a) pay any dividends on the Common Shares, the Second Preferred Shares or
any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, other than stock
dividends payable in Common Shares or any such other shares ranking junior to
the Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be;

Preferred Shares, which rank superior to the Exchangeable Shares with respect
to the payment of dividends or on any liquidation distribution.

  



  

The restrictions in Sections 7.1 (a), (b) and (c) above shall only be
applicable if dividends which have been declared on the
outstanding Exchangeable Shares have not been paid as provided for herein.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE 8 
 PURCHASE FOR CANCELLATION**

cancellation all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares by private agreement
with any holder of Exchangeable Shares for consideration consisting of cash.

  



  

8.2 Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may at any time and from time
to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the outstanding
Exchangeable Shares at any price by tender to all the holders of record of
Exchangeable Shares then outstanding or through the facilities of any stock
exchange on which the Exchangeable Shares are listed or quoted at any price
per share. If in response to an invitation for tenders under the provisions
of this Section 8.2, more Exchangeable Shares are tendered at a price or
prices acceptable to the Corporation than the Corporation is prepared to
purchase, the Exchangeable Shares to be purchased by the Corporation shall be
purchased as nearly as may be pro rata according to the number of shares
tendered by each holder who submits a tender to the Corporation, provided
that when shares are tendered at different prices, the pro rating shall be
effected (disregarding fractions) only with respect to the shares tendered at
the price at which more shares were tendered than the Corporation is prepared
to purchase after the Corporation has purchased all the shares tendered at
lower prices. If part only of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any
certificate shall be purchased, a new certificate for the balance of such
shares shall be issued at the expense of the Corporation.

  



  

8.3 Subject to applicable law, the Corporation by notice from time to time to
ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco, as applicable, shall be entitled at any time
to redeem all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares held by ARC Energy Trust
or ARC Subco which were acquired by them pursuant to the Call Rights, the
Exchange Rights or the Automatic Exchange Rights (as defined in the Voting
and Exchange Trust Agreement) in exchange for the delivery of ARC Energy
Units (the " **Delivered ARC Energy Units** ") to or for the account of a
holder(s) of Exchangeable Shares. The Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed as
set forth in this Section 8.3 shall be acquired by the Corporation in
exchange for the issue by the Corporation to ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco,
as applicable of a promissory note in the principal amount equal to the fair
market value of the Delivered ARC Energy Units (where the fair market value
of the Delivered ARC Energy Units is determined by multiplying the number of
Delivered ARC Energy Units by the weighted average trading price of an
ARC Energy Unit on the TSX for the ten trading days preceding the date of
purchase by ARC Energy Trust or ARC Subco, as applicable of such Delivered
ARC Energy Units). All Exchangeable Shares which are redeemed as set forth in
this Section 8.3 shall be cancelled by the Corporation.

holders of at least 10% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares (other than

or represented by proxy thereat may transact the business for which the

Energy Units which would have been received by the affected holder to the
