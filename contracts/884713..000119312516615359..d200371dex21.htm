Claim, the Purchaser shall procure that, before steps are taken to enforce a
Claim against the Seller following notification under Clause 10.2 of this

are taken to enforce the recovery against the third party and any actual
recovery (less any reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such recovery less

availability of any relief) shall reduce or satisfy, as the case may be, such
Claim to the extent of such recovery.



     | 9.13.3 | Following Recovery from the Seller etc. 
---|---|--- 

If the Seller has paid an amount in discharge of any Claim and subsequently
the Purchaser or any Group Company is entitled to recover (whether by payment,  discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) from a third party a sum
which indemnifies or compensates the Purchaser or any Group Company (in whole
or in part) for the loss or liability which is the subject matter of the
Claim, the Purchaser shall procure that all reasonable steps (taking into
account all relevant circumstances, including factors such as the likelihood
of recovery) are taken to enforce such recovery and shall, or shall procure
that the relevant Group Company shall, pay to the Seller as soon as
practicable after receipt an amount equal to (i) any sum recovered from the
third party less any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery
less any Taxation attributable to the recovery after taking account of any
Tax relief available in respect of any matter giving rise to the claim or if

amount) shall be taken into account, net off or credited more than once for
breach of or under this Agreement, the Tax Deed, the Warranty and Indemnity

Indemnity Insurance or otherwise.

the Purchaser and, following Closing, of the Purchaser to procure each Group
Company to mitigate any loss or damage which it may suffer or incur as a
consequence of any breach of any provision of this Agreement. The
Purchaser shall be subject to an obligation to mitigate any Loss that is or
may be the subject of an Indemnity Claim.



   9.16 | Fraud

for breach of or under this Agreement to the extent it arises or is increased
as a result of fraud by the Seller.



   9.17 | Warranty and Indemnity Insurance 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement:



     | 9.17.1 | the parties acknowledge that, the Purchaser has secured a

"Warranty and Indemnity Insurance"); 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.17.2 |

subrogated action or to exercise rights assigned to it against the Seller or

Seller or its directors or officers, and then only to the extent that the
Claim arises directly as a result of fraud, dishonest misconduct or fraudulent
misrepresentation; 
---|--- 



     | 9.17.3 | the Purchaser: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | shall not agree to any amendment, variation or waiver of the
waiver referred to in Clause 9.17.2 (or do anything which has a similar
effect) without the prior written consent of the Seller; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | shall not novate, or otherwise assign its respective rights
with respect to the waiver referred to in Clause 9.17.2 (or do anything which
has similar effect) or do anything which causes the waiver referred to
in Clause 9.17.2 not to have full force and effect in accordance with its
terms; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | shall, without limitation to any right of the Seller to
separately enforce such terms, use all reasonable endeavours to enforce any
term in the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance under which the WandI Insurer
waives its rights to take subrogated action against the Seller or its
directors or officers upon the terms set out in the Warranty and Indemnity
Insurance; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.17.4 | the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Seller
shall not be liable to pay any excess or any of the costs relating to the
Warranty and Indemnity Insurance (or, for the avoidance of doubt, any
title insurance) other than the Warranty Insurance Policy Costs. The
Purchaser undertakes to apply all amounts deducted from the consideration
payable under Clause 3 as Warranty Insurance Policy Costs towards the payment
of premiums in relation to the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.17.5 | Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or
the Tax Deed, no provision of this Agreement or the Tax Deed shall require the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers Group to take or omit to take any
action that would result in the amounts recoverable by the Purchasers Group
under the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance being in any way limited, void,

   10 | Claims 
---|--- 



   10.1 | Notification of Potential Claims 
---|--- 

If the Purchaser or a member of the Purchasers Group becomes aware of any
fact, matter or circumstance that may give rise to a Claim, the Purchaser
shall as soon as reasonably practicable give a notice in writing to the Seller
setting out such information as is available to the Purchaser as
is reasonably necessary to enable the Seller to assess the merits of the
potential Claim, to act to preserve evidence and to make such provision as the
Seller may consider necessary. Subject to Clause 9.1, failure to give notice
as soon as reasonably practicable shall not affect the rights of the
Purchaser to make a relevant Claim except that the failure may be taken into
account in determining the quantum of liability of the Seller for such Claim. ---|--- 

Notice of any Claim shall be given by the Purchaser to the Seller within the
time limits specified in Clause 9.1 and shall not be treated as having been
validly given unless it contains reasonable information to the extent
available to the Purchaser and Group Companies in relation to the legal and
factual basis of the Claim (including, where the Claim is the result of or in
connection with a claim by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), evidence of
the Third Party Claim) and sets out the Purchasers estimate of the amount
of Losses which is, or is to be, the subject of the Claim (including any
Losses which are contingent on the occurrence of any future event).



   10.3 | Commencement of Proceedings 
---|--- 

Any Claim notified pursuant to Clause 10.2 shall (if it has not been
previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) be deemed to be irrevocably
withdrawn six months after the notice is given pursuant to Clause 10.2 unless
at the relevant time legal proceedings in respect of the Claim have been
commenced by being both issued and served, provided that:



     | 10.3.1 | in the case of a contingent liability, the six month
period shall commence on the date the relevant contingent liability becomes an
actual liability and is due and payable; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.3.2 | in the case of an actual liability that is notified
pursuant to Clause 10.2 but is dependent on a contingent liability becoming an
actual liability in order for the threshold in Clause 9.2 to be exceeded, the
six month period shall commence when the contingent liability becomes an
actual liability and is due and payable. 
---|---|--- 



   10.4 | Investigation by the Seller 
---|--- 

In connection with any matter or circumstance that may give rise to a Claim,
the Purchaser shall allow, and shall procure that the relevant Group Company
allows, the Seller and its financial, accounting or legal advisers to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Claim and
whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of such Claim.



   10.5 | Conduct of Third Party Claims 
---|--- 

If the matter or circumstance giving rise to a Claim (other than a Tax Deed
Claim) against the Seller under this Agreement is a result of or in connection
with a Third Party Claim then the Purchaser shall be entitled, in its absolute
discretion, to take such action as it shall deem necessary to avoid, dispute,
deny, defend, resist, appeal, compromise or contest such claim or liability
(including making counterclaims or other claims against third parties) but
shall:



     | 10.5.1 | so far as practicable, consult with the Seller and take
reasonable account of the requests of the Seller before taking any action in
relation to the Third Party Claim; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.5.2 | make no admissions in relation to the Third Party Claim
or otherwise compromise, dispose of or settle the Third Party Claim without,
in any such case, first consulting with the Seller; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.5.3 | take such action at the Sellers cost as the Seller may
reasonably request to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist, appeal, compromise
or contest the Third Party Claim. 
---|---|--- ---|--- 



   11.1 | Restrictions 
---|--- 

The Seller undertakes with the Purchaser and the Group Companies that
no member of the Sellers Group (in each case, other than a Group Company)
will in any Relevant Capacity directly or indirectly during the Restricted
Period induce or seek to induce any Restricted Employee to become employed
whether as employee, consultant or otherwise by any member of the Sellers
Group, whether or not such Restricted Employee would thereby commit a breach
of his contract of service. The placing of an advertisement of a post
available to the public generally and the recruitment of a person through an
employment agency shall not constitute a breach of this Clause 11.1 provided
that no member of the Sellers Group encourages or advises such agency to
approach any Restricted Employee.

 



   11.2 | Reasonableness of Restrictions 
---|--- 

The Seller agrees that the restrictions contained in this Clause are no
greater than is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the interests
of the Purchaser and the Group Companies but if any such restriction shall be
held to be void but would be valid if deleted in part or reduced
in application, such restriction shall apply with such deletion or
modification as may be necessary to make it valid and enforceable.



   11.3 | Interpretation 
---|--- 

The following terms shall have the following meanings respectively in this
Clause 10.5.3:



     | 11.3.1 | "Relevant Capacity" means for its own account or for that
of any person, firm or company (other than for the Purchaser or the Group
Companies); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 11.3.2 | "Restricted Employee" means any person who is a Senior
Employee, provided that such person is employed by the Group at the time the
Seller or member of the Sellers Group (other than a Group Company)
approaches that person; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.3.3 | "Restricted Period" means two years commencing on Closing
or such shorter period of time recognised by applicable law as being binding
on the Seller. 
---|---|--- 
 



   11.4 | Waiver of Rights 
---|--- 



     | 11.4.1 | The Purchaser hereby warrants and undertakes to the
Seller for itself and as agent and trustee for each shareholder, affiliate,
employee, director, agent, officer of or adviser to any member of the
Sellers Group (each a "Seller Relevant Person") that, other than with
respect to the terms of any Transaction Document or any other direct
contractual obligation existing from time to time between the Purchasers
Group and the Seller Relevant Person, and in the absence of fraud, the
Purchasers Group has no rights against (and waives any rights it may have
against) and will not make a claim against (and waives any claim it may have
against) any Seller Relevant Person.  
---|---|--- 



     | 11.4.2 |

The Seller hereby warrants and undertakes to (i) the Purchaser for itself and
as agent and trustee for each shareholder, affiliate, employee, director,
agent, officer of or adviser to any other member of the Purchasers Group,
and, from Closing, the Group (each a "Purchaser Relevant Person") other than
with respect to the terms of any Transaction Document or any other direct
contractual obligation existing 

---|---|--- Purchaser Relevant Person and in the absence of fraud, the Sellers Group has
no rights against (and waive any rights they may have against) and will not
make a claim against (and waives any claim they may have against) any
Purchaser Relevant Person and (ii) each Debt Provider, their shareholders,
affiliates and each of their respective Representatives (each a
"Debt Provider Relevant Person") that the Sellers Group has no rights
against (and waive any rights they may have against) and will not make a claim
against (and waives any claim they may have against) any Debt Provider
Relevant Person for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in
connection with or related to this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any
other agreement or arrangement in connection therewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any other agreement
or arrangement in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, or the negotiation or execution of any of the foregoing, or in
respect of any representations, warranties or other agreements made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith, through the Purchaser or
otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Clause 11.4.2 limits
the obligations of the Debt Providers to the Purchaser under the Debt
Financing Commitment. 
---|--- 



   11.5 | Obligations towards Covered Persons 
---|--- 

With effect from the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Purchasers
Group to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Groups existing
directors and officers insurance policies (the "DandO Insurance"), in each
case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Closing Date with respect to any claim related to any period of
time at or prior to the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Groups current insurance carrier with respect
to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are no less favourable than the coverage provided under the Groups
existing policies as in effect as of the date hereof.



   11.6 | Seller Distributions 
---|--- 

The Seller agrees that from the Closing Date it shall not distribute or
otherwise pay any amount to its shareholders if following such distribution or
payment it would have insufficient funds to satisfy in full any actual
liabilities it has, and any contingent liabilities it reasonably believes it
may have, to the Purchaser for breach of Clause 2.1.2.

and indemnities under or pursuant to this Agreement (the "Purchasers
Guaranteed Obligations") and agrees that if any Purchasers Guaranteed
Obligation is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal it will, as an
independent and primary obligation, indemnify the Seller immediately on demand
against all Losses which the Seller suffers through or arising from any act or
omission that would be a breach by the Purchaser of the Purchasers
Guaranteed Obligations if the relevant Purchasers Guaranteed Obligation were
not unenforceable, invalid or illegal, to the extent of any limit on the
liability of the Purchaser in this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 



     | 14.1.2 | If and whenever the Purchaser defaults for any reason
whatsoever in the performance of any of the Purchasers Guaranteed
Obligations, the Purchasers Guarantor shall forthwith upon demand
unconditionally perform (or procure performance of) and satisfy (or procure
the satisfaction of) the Purchasers Guaranteed Obligations in regard to which
such default has been made in the manner prescribed by this Agreement and so
that the same benefits shall be conferred on the Seller as it would have
received if the Purchasers Guaranteed Obligations had been duly performed and
satisfied by the Purchaser.

or circumstances (other than any limitation imposed by this Agreement)
shall nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from the
Purchasers Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the Purchasers
Guarantor and the Purchasers Guarantor were the sole or principal obligor in
respect thereof and shall be performed or paid by the Purchasers Guarantor
on demand.

under this Agreement or any affiliate of or person with an interest in such
recipient shall use its reasonable efforts to timely claim from the

---|---|--- 



     | (i) | after payment of such Taxation; and

recipient (or any Affiliate of or person with an interest in such recipient)
in respect of the matter giving rise to the payment, 
---|---|--- the recipient shall be left with a sum equal to the sum that it would have
received in the absence of such a charge to Taxation provided that if the
recipient shall have transferred (for the avoidance of doubt, by whatever
means, including by way of a declaration of trust or anything that amounts in
substance to a transfer) the benefit in whole or in part of this Agreement or
shall have changed its tax residence or the permanent establishment to which
the rights under this Agreement are allocated (or any affiliate of or person
with an interest in the recipient shall have transferred its rights under
this Agreement or its interest in the recipient or changed its tax residence
or the permanent establishment to which its rights under this agreement or its

as an adjustment to the consideration for the Share under the terms of this
