(d)    Without the prior written consent of GCEAR, the only matters that CCIT II shall propose  to be acted on by its stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting shall be approval of the REIT Merger and the Charter  Amendment, other than one or more proposals to approve the adjournment of the Stockholders Meeting, if  necessary, to solicit additional proxies, in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Stockholders  Meeting to obtain the Stockholder Approval.

The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment shall be made by CCIT II in accordance with the  timing set forth in Section 9.3(c) or, at the Termination Payee&#8217;s reasonable request, promptly after receipt of notice  from the Termination Payee that the Escrow Agreement has been executed by the parties thereto. The Escrow  Agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment in escrow or the applicable portion thereof shall be released  to the Termination Payee on an annual basis based upon the delivery by the Termination Payee to the escrow agent  of any one (or a combination) of the following:                        (i)    a letter from the Termination Payee&#8217;s independent certified public accountants  indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Payee without causing the  Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable  taxable year of the Termination Payee determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income  described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(I) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (such income, &#8220;Qualifying REIT Income&#8221;), in  which case the escrow agent shall release to the Termination Payee such maximum amount stated in the  accountant&#8217;s letter;                        (ii)  a letter from the Termination Payee&#8217;s counsel indicating that the Termination  Payee received a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the  Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or would be excluded from gross income  within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to the  Termination Payee the remainder of the Termination Payment; or                        (iii) a letter from the Termination Payee&#8217;s counsel indicating that the Termination  Payee has received a tax opinion from the Termination Payee&#8217;s outside counsel or accountant, respectively, to the  effect that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying  REIT Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the  Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to the Termination Payee the remainder of the Termination  Payment.    If the Termination Payee is CCIT II, the Escrow Agreement shall further provide that, at the end of the third  calendar year beginning after the date on which the Termination Payor&#8217;s obligation to pay the Termination Payment  arose (or earlier if directed by the Termination Payee), any remaining amount then being held in escrow by the  escrow agent shall be disbursed to the Termination Payor and, in the event the Termination Payment has not by then  been paid in full, such unpaid portion shall never be due. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to amend this  Section 9.3(f) at the reasonable request of the Termination Payee in order to (A) maximize the portion of the  Termination Payment that may be distributed to the Termination Payee hereunder without causing the Termination  Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B) improve the Termination  Payee&#8217;s chances of securing the favorable private letter ruling from the IRS described in this Section 9.3(f) or  (C) assist the Termination Payee in obtaining the favorable tax opinion from its outside counsel or accountant  described in this Section 9.3(f). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Termination Payee shall bear all costs  and expenses under the Escrow Agreement. The Termination Payor shall not be a party to the Escrow Agreement  and shall not bear any liability, cost or expense resulting directly or indirectly from the Escrow Agreement (other  than any Taxes imposed on the Termination Payor in connection therewith).                                               73                  \\DC - 769032/000001 - 15587362 v40   </FONT></DIV>

The rights and remedies herein  provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law, except to the extent  expressly provided otherwise in Section 9.3 (Fees and Expenses).              Section 10.7 Governing Law; Venue.                 (a)    This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in contract or in  tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance  of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland  without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles (whether the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that  would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland).

Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.2.  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.             Section 10.8 Assignment. Except as may be required to satisfy the obligations contemplated by  Section 7.7 (Indemnification; Directors&#8217; and Officers&#8217; Insurance), neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,  interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law  or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties. This Agreement shall be  binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns,  and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 10.8 shall be null and void.             Section 10.9 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of  the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise  breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly  agreed that, prior to the effective time of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 9, each Party shall be  entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms  and provisions of this Agreement, and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any  bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at  Law or in equity. In the event that any Action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this  Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.  To the extent any Party brings an Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this  Agreement (other than an Action to specifically enforce any provision that survives termination of this Agreement)  when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall automatically  be extended to (a) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such Action, or (b) such other time  period established by the court presiding over such Action.                                               76                  \\DC - 769032/000001 - 15587362 v40   </FONT></DIV>
