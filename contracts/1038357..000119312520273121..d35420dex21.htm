reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to the Opco LLC Units, in each case having a record date occurring on

and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the

(c) If payment of the Company Merger Consideration or the Opco Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name

Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to (A) the

2.4(f)_, in each case until the holder thereof shall surrender such

Shares or the delivery of a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal by a holder of Opco LLC Stapled Units, as applicable, in each case
in accordance with this _Article II_ , there shall be paid to such holder,
without interest, (1) promptly after such surrender, the amount of any

the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been issued and paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Class A
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, the Book-Entry Shares
or the Opco LLC Stapled Units, as applicable. At the Effective Time, (i) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no

to the Effective Time, and (ii) the transfer books of Opco LLC shall be closed

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or
Opco LLC Stapled Units, no dividends or other distributions with respect to
the Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of
the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former
stockholder of the Company or former member of Opco LLC who otherwise would
be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an amount in
cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive (taking into account all shares of Company Class A Common Stock or

holders of Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Opco LLC Stapled Units 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon
demand, and any remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (except
to the extent representing Excluded Shares) or Opco LLC Stapled Units (except
to the extent representing Excluded Opco LLC Units) shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Company, as general creditors thereof, for payment of the
Company Merger Consideration or Opco Merger Consideration (as applicable),
any unpaid dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.4(d)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_ (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws), without interest.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, the Opco
Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any Person in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto or cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws.

 



13

    

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
reasonably directed by Parent on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments in amounts in excess of the amounts payable
hereunder shall be paid to Parent on demand at any time and from time to time.
Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Certificates,
Book-Entry Shares or Opco LLC Stapled Units pursuant to this Agreement. To the
extent, for any reason, the amount in the Exchange Fund is below that
required to make prompt payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by
this _Article II_ , Parent shall promptly replace, restore or supplement the
cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the
payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent
and the Exchange Agent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Company with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Company Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(f)_.

Section 2.5 _Withholding Rights_.

 

(a) Each of the Parent Parties, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Company, the Opco Surviving Company, the Company, Opco LLC and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and
withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Eligible
Shares, Opco LLC Stapled Units or Company Stock Awards, as applicable, such
amounts as the Person making such payment is required to deduct and withhold
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, to the extent deduction and withholding is required in
respect of the delivery of any Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, a portion of the Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable
hereunder may be withheld). To the extent that amounts are so properly
deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
or withholding was made, and, if a portion of the Parent Common Stock
otherwise deliverable to a Person is withheld hereunder, the relevant
withholding party shall be treated as having sold such Parent Common Stock on
behalf of such Person for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value
thereof at the time of the required withholding (which fair market value
shall be deemed to be the closing price of shares of Parent Common Stock on
the NYSE on the Closing Date) and having paid such cash proceeds to the
appropriate Governmental Entity.

 



14

    

(b) Opco LLC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent at
or prior to the Closing a properly executed certificate of non-foreign
status, meeting the requirements of Code Sections 1445 and 1446(f) (and the
applicable regulations thereunder), in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent, with respect to each holder of Opco LLC Units. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause to be deducted and withheld, any amount under Code Sections 1445 and
1446(f) from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Opco LLC Units (in respect of such Opco LLC Units) for which
such a certificate of non-foreign status is provided; _provided_ , that this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_ shall not be construed to restrict the rights of the
Exchange Agent or any Party to withhold under Code Sections 1445 and 1446(f)
in respect of a change in applicable tax law occurring after the date of
this Agreement.

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be treated in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall serve prompt notice
to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Class B Common
Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other
instruments received by the Company relating to rights to appraisal, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or
offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. For the
avoidance of doubt, (a) no dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available
with respect to the Company Class A Common Stock or with respect to the Opco
LLC Units and (b) appraisal rights shall be limited to an appraisal, pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL, solely of the fair value of the Company Class B
Common Stock, as such.

held as suspense funds or (z) the amount or validity of which is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate
reserves have been established) and (iii) none of the Company or any of its

suspense funds or (z) the amount or validity of which is being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have
been established) and (iii) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to
Parents knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of, or
taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time,

any of its Subsidiaries.

with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action (I) would prohibit
the counterparty from making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to the Parent
Board or the Company Board, as applicable, in compliance with this  _Section_
__ _ 5.2_ and (II) would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Parent Stockholders or the Company Stockholders, as applicable, under

consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take the actions
referred to in clause (x) or (y) below would be inconsistent with its

Stockholders, respectively, under applicable Law, then Parent or the Company

Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, directly or indirectly through any
Representative, from seeking to clarify the terms and conditions of such
inquiry or proposal to determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes
or would be reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_, as applicable, would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law;

 



74

    

_provided_ _further_ , that the Company Board may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless:

(1) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least four Business Days before

Section 5.3 _Preparation of Form_ __ _ S_ _-4 and Joint Proxy
Statement; Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ _s_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) prepare
and cause to be filed with the SEC a mutually acceptable proxy statement (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ")
to be sent to (A) the Company Stockholders relating to the special meeting of
Company Stockholders (including any postponement or adjournment thereof, the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be held to consider the adoption of
this Agreement and (B) the Parent Stockholders relating to the special
meeting of Parent Stockholders (including any postponement or adjournment
thereof, the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be held to consider the
approval of the Stock Issuance; and (ii) in consultation with one another,
set a preliminary record date for each of the Company Stockholders Meeting and
the Parent Stockholders Meeting and commence broker searches pursuant
to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. As promptly as

the Companys reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Form_ __ _ S_ _-4_ "), in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included
as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act
of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Mergers. The Company and

  



77

    

 Parent shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide
all information related to themselves, their respective Subsidiaries and
equityholders as may be required or reasonably requested by the other Party
or as requested by the staff of the SEC to be included in the Form S-4 and
Joint Proxy Statement, to cause the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement to
comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Transactions. Parent shall also take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process) required
to be taken under any applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws
in connection with the Stock Issuance and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries and the holders of
Company Class A Common Stock, Company Class B Common Stock and Opco LLC Units
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement,
or any response to comments from or other communication to the SEC with
respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, will be made by Parent
or the Company, as applicable, without providing the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and without the others prior
approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Each of Parent and the
Company will advise the other Party promptly after it receives oral or written
notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly
provide the others with copies of any written communication from the SEC or
any state securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the responses thereto. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not contain
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall promptly be filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to Parent
Stockholders and/or Company Stockholders; _provided_ that the delivery of such
notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any Party hereunder
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party.

 



78

    

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, the Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting, for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote required
by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith. Such Company
Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be no later than 45 calendar days
after the date on which the SEC declares the Form S-4 effective. The Company
may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting solely (i) with the
prior written consent of Parent; (ii) (A) due to the absence of a quorum or
(B) if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock for
the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to
solicit additional proxies; or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for
the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company Stockholders
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that the Company may
not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting more than a total of
two times pursuant to clause (ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of this _Section_
__ _ 5.3(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall, at the
request of Parent, to the extent permitted by Law, adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting to a date specified by Parent for the absence of a quorum
or if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock for
the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be
required to adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting more than one
time pursuant to this sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant to this
sentence shall be required to be for a period exceeding 10 Business Days.
Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company
specifically permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ and subject to the
Companys ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(e)_, the Company, through the Company Board, shall (i) recommend to its
stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and (ii) include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company agrees that (x) except in the event of an
Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by _Section_ __ _
5.2(d)_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (y) its obligations pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any
other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(d) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, Parent shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Parent Stockholders Meeting, for the purpose of obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule
14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith. Such Parent
Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be no later than 45 calendar days
after the date on which the SEC declares the Form S-4 effective. Parent may
postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting solely (i) with the prior
written consent of the Company; (ii) (A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B)
if Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
of Parent Common Stock for the Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies; or (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that the Parent Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be 

 



79

    

 disseminated and reviewed by the Parent Stockholders prior to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that Parent may not postpone or adjourn the
Parent Stockholders Meeting more than a total of two times pursuant to clause
(ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall, at the request of the Company, to the extent
permitted by Law, adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting to a date specified
by the Company for the absence of a quorum or if Parent has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that Parent shall not be
required to adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting more than one time
pursuant to this sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant to this sentence
shall be required to be for a period exceeding 10 Business Days. Except
in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change by Parent specifically
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_, Parent, through the Parent Board, shall
(i) recommend to its stockholders that they approve the Stock Issuance
and (ii) include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent agrees that (x) except in the
event of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval and (y) its
obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
Parent or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of
any Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to set the record dates for and hold the Parent Stockholders
Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, on the same day
and at approximately the same time.

 

Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford to the other Party and its Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, during the period
prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, to all their respective properties, assets, books,
contracts, commitments, key personnel and records and, during such period,
each such Party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to the other Party a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
Party may reasonably request (including Tax Returns filed and those in
preparation and the work papers of its auditors); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not require the any Party to disclose any information
to the extent such disclosure would, in the good faith determination of the
disclosing Party, contravene applicable Law, jeopardize any attorney-client or
other legal privilege or breach any existing Contract. All such information
shall be held confidential in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or information provided, made available or delivered to
any Party pursuant to this Agreement shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be
permitted to perform any invasive testing, monitoring, or other investigations
such as for sampling or analysis of any environmental media or operation of
any equipment, without the prior written consent of whichever Party owns the
media or equipment to be tested.

 



80

    

Section 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Transactions, including using its reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all required consents,
approvals or waivers from, or participation in other discussions or
negotiations with, third parties, including as required under any Parent
Material Contract or Company Material Contract (as applicable); (ii) obtain
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities, make all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings and make all reasonable best efforts to obtain all
approvals or waivers from, or to avoid any Action by, any Governmental Entity,
including filings under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice; and (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions and fully to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other
consideration or make any other concession, waiver or amendment under any
Contract in connection with obtaining any consent without the prior written
consent of Parent. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish to the other
Party such information as such other Party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating to the
exchange of information, each of Parent and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult with
the other in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent
or the Company, respectively, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, Parent and the Company shall keep one
another reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other written communications received by Parent and the
Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from
any Governmental Entity and/or third party with respect to the Transactions,
and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, shall provide the
other Party and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation
or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall take any
and all action necessary, including (i) agreeing or proffering to divest or
hold separate (in a trust or otherwise), or take any other action with respect
to, any of the assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or, assuming the consummation of the Mergers, the
Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates, (ii) agreeing or proffering to
limit in any manner whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of ownership of
any securities (including the shares of

 



81

    

 Company Class A Common Stock, Company Class B Common Stock or the Opco LLC
Units), (iii) agreeing to terminate any existing relationships, contractual
rights or obligations of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Affiliates or (iv) entering into any agreement that in any
way limits the ownership or operation of any business, properties or assets of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Affiliates _(provided_ , _however_ , that any such action may, at the
discretion of Parent, be conditioned upon consummation of the Mergers) (each a
" _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any
order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or
permanent), or establishes any Law or other action preliminarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of
the Mergers, or to ensure that no Governmental Entity with the authority to
clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Mergers, fails
to do so by the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to
take any Divestiture Action in each case to the extent such Divestiture Action
would reasonably be expected to have a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect.
For purposes of this Agreement, the terms " _Regulatory Material Adverse
Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
business, revenue or EBITDA of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
from and after the Effective Time.

Section 5.6 _Takeover Laws_. Each of Parent, the Parent Board, the Company
and the Company Board shall (a) take no action to cause any Takeover Law to
become applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions and (b) if any
Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions,
take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions.

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company
shall promptly notify the other Party of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (b)
any other material notice or material communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions, (c) any Action commenced or, to
such Partys knowledge, threatened against, that questions the validity or
legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith or (d)
(i) any change, condition or event that results in any of the conditions in
_Sections_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or  _7.3(a)_ not being met or (ii) the failure of
such Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement (including any condition set forth in _Article VI_ ) to
be complied with or satisfied hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the
Parties.

 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Each Parent Party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 5.8 _is intended to limit any other rights that any current or former
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") may have pursuant to any employment agreement
or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof or

 



82

    

 otherwise. Each Parent Party further agrees, and shall cause the Surviving
Company to take all action reasonably necessary to ensure, that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and expense advancement and reimbursement
existing in favor of the Indemnified Persons of the Company as provided in any
indemnification agreements with such Indemnified Persons and in the Company
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed and
performed by the Surviving Company (and Parent shall fully guarantee the
performance and payment thereof by the Surviving Company) and shall continue
in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to any claims against such Indemnified Persons
arising out of such acts or omissions, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall amend any applicable
organizational documents of the Surviving Company as necessary in order to
ensure that such indemnification and exculpation rights are assumed and
performed by the Surviving Company.

 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Company will cause to be put in place, and Parent
shall fully prepay prior to the Effective Time, "tail" insurance policies
with a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from the
Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_")
in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at,
prior to, or after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance exceed during the Tail
Period 300% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for
such purpose (which current aggregate annual premium is hereby represented and
warranted by the Company to be as set forth in Section 5.8(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter); and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Company shall obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, shall (i) consolidate with or merge into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successor
and assign of Parent or the Surviving Company (as applicable) assumes the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall survive consummation of
the Mergers and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives.

Section 5.9  _Certain NYSE and SEC Matters_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in such Mergers, and such other shares of Parent
Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with such Mergers, in
each case, as provided for in _Article II_ , to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



83

    

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Law and the rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Company of the Company Class A Common Stock from
the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Class A Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give the other Party the opportunity to participate in the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against such Party and/or its
officers or directors relating to the Transactions and shall consider in good
faith the other Partys advice with respect to such stockholder
litigation. Prior to the Closing, neither Parent nor the Company will enter
into any settlement agreement in respect of any stockholder litigation against
such Party and/or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions
without the other Partys prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 5.11 _Certain Tax Matters_.

(a) Each of the Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Integrated Mergers, taken
together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Neither Parent nor the Company shall (nor shall they
permit their respective Subsidiaries to) take any action (whether or not
otherwise permitted under this Agreement), or cause any action to be taken,
which action would prevent or impede, or that could reasonably be expected to
prevent or impede, the Integrated Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of
Parent and the Company will notify the other Party promptly after becoming
aware of any reason to believe that the Integrated Mergers, taken together,
may not qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the Parties hereto adopt
this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). The relevant Parties shall
treat the Integrated Mergers, taken together, as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal, state and
other relevant income Tax purposes, shall file all their Tax Returns
consistent with such tax treatment and, except to the extent otherwise
required by a final "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of
the Code, take no Tax position inconsistent with such Tax treatment.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate and use its
reasonable best efforts, in order for the Company to obtain the opinion of
counsel referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_. In connection therewith, (i)
the Company shall deliver to such counsel a duly authorized and
executed officers certificate, dated as of the Closing Date (and, if
requested, dated as of such additional dates as may be necessary in connection
with the preparation, filing and delivery of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement), containing such representations as shall be reasonably necessary
or appropriate to enable such counsel to render the opinion described in
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ (the " _Company Officer s Tax Certificate_"), and
(ii) Parent shall deliver to such counsel a duly authorized and executed
officers certificate, dated as of the

 



84

    

 Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of such additional dates as may be
necessary in connection with the preparation, filing and delivery of the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement), containing such representations as
shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable such counsel to render
the opinion described in  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ (the " _Parent Officer s
Tax Certificate_"), and Parent and the Company shall provide such other
information as reasonably requested by counsel for purposes of rendering the
opinion described in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ (or any opinions to be filed in
connection with the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement).

 

(d) Parent, the Company and Opco LLC acknowledge and agree that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (and for the purposes of any applicable state or
local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the Opco Merger
is intended to be treated with respect to the holders (other than the Company)
of Opco LLC Units as a taxable sale by each such holder of the Opco LLC Units
held by such holder in exchange for the Opco Merger Consideration, and
Parent, the Company and Opco shall file their respective Tax Returns
consistent with the intended tax treatment described above and, except to the
extent otherwise required by a final "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code, take no Tax position inconsistent with such Tax
treatment.

 

Section 5.12 ___Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, subject to the
restrictions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, each of the Company and
Parent shall coordinate with the others the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Company Class A Common Stock, Opco LLC Units and Parent Common
Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the Parties that holders of Company Class A Common Stock and Opco
LLC Units shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend,
for any quarter with respect to their shares of Company Class A Common Stock
or Opco LLC Units (as applicable), on the one hand, and any shares of Parent
Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Mergers, on
the other.

 

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Parties shall, and each will
cause its Representatives to, consult with the other Parties before issuing,
and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement and
the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make
any public announcement without the prior written approval of the other
Parties (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may, without the prior approval of the
other Parties or providing the other Parties the opportunity for such
consultation and review, issue a press release or make a public statement that
is consistent with prior press releases or public statements made in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ or any communication plan
or strategy previously agreed to by Parent and the Company. The initial press
release of the Parties announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be a
joint press release of Parent and the Company in a form that is mutually
agreed. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_
shall (i) prevent Parent or the Company from issuing any press release or
making any public statement in the ordinary course that does not relate

from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.15 _Employee and Employment Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to provide each individual who is employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time and who continues employment with the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with (i)
a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than the base salary or
wage rate in effect for such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) health, paid time off and retirement benefits and
annual cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the health, paid time off and retirement benefits and annual
cash incentive opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company, to continue and honor its obligations under all employment,
severance, change in control and other agreements, if any, between the Company
(or a Subsidiary thereof) and each individual who is employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and calculation of
vacation or severance benefit entitlements (but not for purposes of defined
benefit pension accrual or post-employment retiree welfare benefits) with
respect to the benefit plans, programs, arrangements, policies and
practices maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries providing benefits
to any Company Employee after the Closing Date, each Company Employees years
of service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor
employer of an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the
extent service with such predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or
the applicable Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement) prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent or its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent (A) that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits
for the same period of service or (B) that such service is not recognized by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under any applicable
Company Plan in which the Company Employee was eligible to participate prior
to the Effective Time.

 



86

    

(c) For purposes of each benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which
any Company Employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions, waiting periods, evidence of insurability and actively-
at-work requirements to be waived for each Company Employee and their covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived
under the comparable Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) give full credit for all co-
payments, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket requirements and deductibles to
the extent satisfied in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs as if
there had been a single continuous employer.

 

(d) Effective as of the day prior to the Effective Time but contingent upon
the Closing, the Company shall cause to be approved board resolutions
terminating the Parsley Energy, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_
") unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that the Company
401(k) Plan shall not be terminated. Unless Parent provides such
written notice to the Company, the Company shall provide Parent copies of
such board resolutions. Effective as soon as administratively practicable
following the Closing, each Company Employee shall be eligible to participate
in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or designated by
Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), subject to the terms and conditions of
the Parent 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable after the Closing and to the
extent not prohibited under applicable Law, Parent shall take all action
necessary to provide that each Company Employee may elect to rollover his or
her full account balance in the Company 401(k) Plan in cash to the
Parent 401(k) Plan.

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to
the benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _
5.15_, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer upon any other Person
(including any current or former directors, officers, consultants or employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, on or after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) any rights or remedies of
any nature whatsoever, (ii) is intended to be, shall constitute or be
construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Company or any respective Subsidiary thereof or (iii) obligates
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to retain the employment of any particular
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time.

Section 5.16 _Delivery of Written Consents_. Promptly following the execution
of this Agreement, Parent will, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Parent Organizational Documents, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub Inc., deliver to the Company a duly executed written consent

of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions. Each of the
Parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating
thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions
in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or
award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the
Parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the Parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in

 



104

    

 Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

Section 8.9 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, prior to any termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware,  _provided_ , that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then in any federal court located
in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
such Party is entitled at law or in equity. Each Party accordingly agrees (a)
the non-breaching Party will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable
relief, without proof of actual damages; and (b) the alleged breaching Party
will not raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party
under this Agreement and will not plead in defense thereto that there are
adequate remedies at Law, all in accordance with the terms of this _Section_
__ _ 8.10_. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument
in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument. If prior to the Outside Date, any Party hereto brings an
action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended
by such other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

 

Section 8.11 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

Section 8.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.

 



105

    

Section 8.13 _No Other Parties to this Agreement_. Each of the following is
herein referred to as a "Company Affiliate": (a) any direct or indirect
holder of equity interests or securities in any Company Party (whether
stockholders or otherwise), and (b) any director, officer, employee,
Representative or agent of (i) any Company Party or (ii) any Person who
controls any Company Party. No Company Affiliate not a Party to this Agreement
shall have any liability or obligation to any Parent Party of any nature
whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement or the Transactions,
and the Parent Parties hereby waive and release all claims of any such
liability and obligation, other than for Fraud. Each of the following is
herein referred to as a "Parent Affiliate": (x) any direct or indirect holder
of equity interests or securities in any Parent Party (whether stockholders or
otherwise), and (y) any director, officer, employee, Representative or agent

Parent Affiliate not a Party to this Agreement shall have any liability or
obligation to any Company Party of any nature whatsoever in connection with or
under this Agreement or the Transactions, and the Company Parties hereby
waive and release all claims of any such liability and obligation, other than
for Fraud. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.13_ will relieve any Company
Affiliate of any contractual obligations expressly set forth in the TRA
Amendment or any Voting Agreement to which such Company Affiliate is a party.

Section 8.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party.

 

Section 8.16 _Facsimile or .pdf Signature_

 

. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or .pdf signature and a
facsimile or .pdf signature shall constitute an original for all purposes.

Section 8.17 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each Party acknowledges

law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed

EXHIBIT A

 

Form of TRA Amendment

 

[ _See attached._ ]

 

EXHIBIT A

   

TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT AMENDMENT

 

This Tax Receivable Agreement Amendment (this "Agreement") is entered into as
of October 20, 2020, by and among Parsley Energy, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), Bryan Sheffield (the "Agent"), and certain TRA
Holders (as defined herein) listed on _Annex A_ (collectively, the "Parties").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Company, the members of Parsley Energy, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Opco LLC"), and the Agent entered into that certain Tax
Receivable Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2014 (the "TRA");

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Opco LLC, Pioneer Natural Resources Company, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Pearl First Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation,
Pearl Second Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Pearl
Opco Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, entered into that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 20, 2020 (the
"Merger Agreement");

WHEREAS, Article IV of the TRA provides for an Early Termination Payment in
the event of a Change of Control, and the definition of "Early Termination
Payment" in Section 4.3(b) of the TRA provides the methodology for calculating
such Early Termination Payment;

 

WHEREAS, Section 4.1(a) of the TRA contemplates that, in addition to the Early
Termination Payment, certain other amounts may be required to be paid in
connection with the termination of the TRA;

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 7.6(c) of the TRA, the Parties desire to amend
the TRA pursuant to its terms to clarify that the Early Termination Payments
(and any other payments contemplated by the preceding recital) will be
calculated using the Calculation Methodology (as defined below);

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 7.6(c) of the TRA, the Parties further desire to
amend the TRA to clarify that the TRA will be terminated (and the Company and
its Affiliates will be released from all further obligations thereunder) once
each person entitled to payment under the TRA (each such person, a "TRA
Holder") receives the applicable Termination Payment (as defined below).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual agreements and
covenants hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound, the
Parties hereby agree as follows:

1\. Definitions; References. Unless otherwise specifically defined herein,
each capitalized term used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in the TRA. This Agreement shall constitute
an amendment of the TRA. To the extent there is a conflict or inconsistency
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the TRA (prior to giving
effect to this Agreement), this Agreement shall govern.

   

2\. TRA Acceleration. The Parties agree that the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will give rise to a
"Change of Control" as defined in the TRA (such Change of Control, the "MA
Change of Control"). Furthermore, the Parties agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the TRA and without any
further action on the part of any person (including, without limitation, the
Parties), the TRA shall be terminated in its entirety upon payment of the
Termination Payments, and thereafter no Party shall have any further
obligations under the TRA other than those obligations set forth in this
Agreement.

3. Payment. The Parties agree that, on the Closing Date (as such term is
defined in the Merger Agreement) (the "Closing Date") immediately after the
Effective Time (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), the
Company shall make a payment to each TRA Holder listed on _Annex B_ , and
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the TRA, each such payment
shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the methodology utilized in
the spreadsheet entitled "Parsley ETP Model_$11.00 per Share_With
Formulas.xlsx" provided to Parent on October 20, 2020, a summary example of
the output of which is attached hereto as _Annex C_ (in calculating such
payments, utilizing, for the avoidance of doubt, only those categories of
inputs and assumptions set forth in such spreadsheet, but making necessary
updates to the relevant amounts, percentages, rates and dates set forth
therein) (such methodology set forth in such spreadsheet, the "Calculation
Methodology," and the amount of the payment to each TRA Holder calculated
using such methodology, the "Termination Payment" and collectively for all of
the TRA Holders, the "Termination Payments"). _Annex B_ shall not be amended,
modified or otherwise adjusted without the prior written consent of all of the
Parties affected by such amendment. Prior to the Closing (as such term is
defined in the Merger Agreement), the Agent and each such TRA Holder shall
provide to the Company the bank account information where the Termination
Payments shall be sent by wire transfer. The Agent and each TRA Holder hereby
waives its right to receive any schedules, notices and documentation
described in Article II or Article IV of the TRA relating to the calculation
and payment of any Termination Payment. Upon receipt by a TRA Holder of its
respective Termination Payment, the Company shall have no further obligation
under the TRA to such TRA Holder or any other person claiming through such
TRA Holder on account of such TRA Holders interest in the TRA, and each TRA
Holder hereby accepts such TRA Holders respective Termination Payment in full
satisfaction of all amounts to which such TRA Holder is or would be entitled
under the TRA and releases, remises and forever discharges the Company, its
Affiliates and its and their respective successors, shareholders, directors,
officers and employees from any obligation under the TRA, except for such TRA
Holders right to receive its Termination Payment, as calculated in a manner
consistent with this Agreement.

 

4\. Intended Tax Treatment. Consistent with the terms of the TRA, the Parties
agree that (a) the part of the Termination Payment paid to a TRA Holder
hereunder that is attributable to PE Units that were exchanged by the TRA
Holder in an Exchange prior to the Closing Date is intended to be treated for
all tax purposes as additional consideration to such TRA Holder from the
Company for the prior acquisition by the Company of the relevant PE Units in
the relevant Exchange, unless otherwise required by law, with a portion of
such additional consideration treated as imputed interest to the extent
required by law (as reasonably determined by the Company), and (b) the
remainder of the Termination Payment paid to such TRA Holder is intended to be
treated for all tax purposes as additional consideration payable to 

 



A-2

    

 such TRA Holder from Parent for the PE Units exchanged by such TRA Holder in
the Opco Merger (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), and none of
the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of the Parties, will take a
position for tax reporting purposes inconsistent therewith, except upon a
final determination by an applicable taxing authority. In connection with the
payment of the Termination Payment to each TRA Holder, such TRA Holder will
be provided a statement, a form of which is attached as _Annex D_ , setting
forth the allocation of the Termination Payment (which allocation will be
based on the Calculation Methodology) to PE Units exchanged as described in
clause (a) (which will be reflected opposite such TRA Holders name under the
heading "Payments Attributable to PE Units Exchanged Prior to the Closing
Date") and to PE Units acquired by Parent in the Opco Merger as described in
clause (b) (which will be reflected opposite such TRA Holders name on _Annex
D_ under the heading "Payments Attributable to PE Units Exchanged in the Opco
Merger"). The Company will promptly provide the Agent with such
additional information and assistance as the Agent may reasonably request in
connection with tax reporting matters relating to the payments contemplated by
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

 

5\. Agreement Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no force
and effect upon (a) the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to its
terms, (b) an amendment to the Merger Agreement that changes the form or
amount of the Opco Merger Consideration (as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement) or (c) the occurrence of a Change of Control other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement shall not by itself
constitute a termination of the TRA.

 

6\. No TRA Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.6
of the TRA, none of the TRA Holders may directly or indirectly assign all or
any portion of such TRA Holders interest in the TRA or this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict any TRA
Holder from exercising its Exchange Right and participating in an Exchange
prior to the Closing Date.

7\. Amendments; Waivers. The Parties agree that Section 7.6(c) of the TRA
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "No
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived unless such amendment or
waiver, as applicable, is approved in writing by the Corporate Taxpayer and by
TRA Holders who would be entitled to receive at least two-thirds of the Early
Termination Payments payable to all TRA Holders hereunder if the Corporate
Taxpayer had exercised its right of early termination on the date of the most
recent Exchange prior to such amendment or waiver (excluding, for purposes of
this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Holder pursuant to this Agreement
since the date of such most recent Exchange); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no such amendment or waiver shall be effective if such amendment or waiver, as
applicable, would have a disproportionate effect on the payments certain TRA
Holders will or may receive under this Agreement unless all
such disproportionately affected TRA Holders consent in writing to such
amendment or waiver."

 



A-3

    

8\. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company represents
and warrants to the Agent and the TRA Holders as follows (which
representations and warranties shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations):

 

(a) _Authorization of Transaction_. The Company has all requisite corporate

(c) _No Additional Representations_. The Company acknowledges that no person

9\. Representations and Warranties of the Agent and the unitholders of Opco
LLC party to this Agreement. Each of the Agent and each TRA Holder listed on
_Annex A_ represents and warrants to the other Parties hereto as follows

authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute and deliver this Agreement and

delivered by such Party and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such
Party and each other person entitled to payment under the TRA, enforceable
against such Party and each other person entitled to payment under the TRA in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
general equitable principles or by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium, or similar laws, legal requirements and
judicial decisions from time to time in effect which affect creditors rights
generally. The Agent and the TRA Holders listed on _Annex A_  collectively
constitute "TRA Holders who would be entitled to receive at least two-thirds
of the Early Termination Payments payable to all TRA Holders" under the TRA
within the meaning of Section 7.6(c) of the TRA, as of the date hereof.

 



A-4

organizational documents of such Party, (ii) require on the part of such
Party any notice to or filing with, or any permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any governmental entity or (iii) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to such Party or

may not be terminated other than pursuant to Paragraph 5 or waived in any
respect, by any Party without the prior written consent of Parent (which

Agreement) and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

advised that any further instruments, actions, or things are necessary or
desirable to carry out the terms of this Agreement, each Party shall execute
