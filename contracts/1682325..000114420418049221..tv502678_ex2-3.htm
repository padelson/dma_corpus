 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  



  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into on
September 12, 2018 by and among CityBase, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company
(" _GTY_ "), GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a Massachusetts corporation ("
_Holdings_ "), GTY CB Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger
Sub_ "), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company, solely in its capacity as the CB Holders' Representative
pursuant to the designation in _Section 10.18_. All capitalized terms used in
this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in _Article 9_
or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context
clearly provides otherwise. Each of the Company, GTY, Holdings and Merger Sub
may also be referred to individually herein as a " _Party,_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_."

  



  

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

  



  

A.  GTY is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting
a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.

  



  

B. Holdings is a newly formed, wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of GTY
and was formed for the purpose of consummating the Transaction and the Roll-
Up Transactions, and the parties hereto have agreed that it is desirable to
utilize Holdings to effectuate the Transaction and file the Registration
Statement with the SEC.

  



  

C. Prior to the Effective Time, a newly formed wholly-owned
subsidiary of Holdings (" _GTY Merger Sub_ ") will merge with and into GTY
with GTY continuing as the surviving entity upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in an agreement and plan of merger by and among
Holdings, GTY and GTY Merger Sub (the " _GTY Merger_ ").

  



  

D. Merger Sub is a newly formed, wholly-owned Subsidiary of GTY,
and was formed for the sole purpose of the Transaction.

  



  

E. The Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged in the business of
offering an enterprise content, digital services and payment platform for
government and utilities (the " _Business_ ").

  



  

F. The Parties desire that, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub merge
with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the
surviving entity upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ").

  



  

G. Each of the Board of Directors of Holdings (the " _Holdings
Board_ ") and the Board of Directors of GTY (the " _GTY Board_ ") has (a)
determined that it is in the best interests of its stockholders for Holdings
to acquire the Company and (b) approved this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in each case, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



    



 



    



  

H.   The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ")
and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub, in each case, in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the  " _DGCL_ "), has
unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of its
stockholders for Holdings to acquire the Company and (b) approved this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, in each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

  



  

I.   For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Parties intend that
the GTY Merger, together with the Merger and other transactions to be
consummated as part of the Roll-up Transactions qualify as a contribution of
CB Shares by the CB Holders to Holdings described in Section 351 of the Code.

  



  

Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and other valuable consideration herein contained, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

(a) _Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL,

the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving company (the " _Surviving Company_ "), and shall
continue to be governed by the applicable Laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

(b) _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
prior to the Closing, the Parties shall duly prepare, and at the
Closing, execute and file a certificate of merger for the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware with respect to the Merger and make all other filings or recordings
as may be required by the DGCL to make the Merger effective. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the
Parties shall agree and as shall be set forth in the GTY Certificate of
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

(c) _Effect of Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective
Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises,
licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Company.

  



  

(d) _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company_. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to contain the
provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub.

  



    

 | -2-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Bylaws of the Surviving Company._ At the Effective Time,
Holdings shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving Company to be amended
and restated in their entirety to contain the provisions as set forth
substantially in the bylaws of Merger Sub.

  



  

(f) _Directors of the Surviving Company_. The directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Company immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Company until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Company.

  



  

(g) _Officers of the Surviving Company_. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Company, until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Company.

  



  

1.2 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock and Options_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the
part of the Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, GTY or any CB Holder:

  



  

(a) _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each Share of Capital Stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be automatically converted into and become one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

  



  

(b) _CB Shares_. Each CB Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive (A) an amount equal to the Per Share Closing Cash
Consideration, calculated as set forth in Schedule 1.2(b), payable to the
holder thereof in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.3_ ,
_plus_ (B) the amounts, if any, that become payable in respect of such CB
Share in the future from the Purchase Price Escrow Account, _plus_ (C)
the amounts, if any, that become payable in respect of such CB Share in the
future from the Indemnity Escrow Account, _plus_ (D) the amounts, if any,
that become payable in respect of such CB Share in the future from the
remaining balance of the Expense Fund, if any, pursuant to _Section 10.18(e)_
, _plus_ (D) the Earnout Consideration in accordance with _Exhibit B_
(collectively, the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), and the holders
thereof shall cease to have any further rights as holders of CB Shares. The
payment of the Earnout Consideration shall be made in accordance with _Exhibit
B_.

  



    

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this _Article 1_ any CB Shares held by Persons who object to the
Merger and comply with the provisions of the DGCL concerning the rights of
holders of CB Shares to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of
their CB Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ " and such Persons, " _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted into a right to receive any portion
of the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to such
rights as are granted by the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who
becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to the DGCL shall
receive payment therefor from the Surviving Company in accordance with the
DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any such holder of Dissenting
Shares shall have failed to establish such holder's entitlement to
appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL, or (ii) if any such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn such holder's demand for
appraisal of such shares or lost such holder's right to appraisal and payment
for such holder's shares under the DGCL, such holder shall forfeit the right
to appraisal of such shares and each such share shall not constitute a
Dissenting Share and shall be treated as if it had been a CB Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted, as of the
Effective Time, into a right to receive from the Surviving Company the
portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance with this _Article 1_ , without any interest thereon
(and such holder shall be treated as a CB Holder). The Company shall provide
GTY reasonably prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of CB Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and GTY
shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Without the prior written consent of
GTY, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. From and after the
Effective Time, no stockholder of the Company who has properly exercised and
perfected appraisal rights pursuant to the DGCL shall be entitled to vote his
or her CB Shares for any purpose or receive payment of dividends or other
distributions with respect to his or her CB Shares (except dividends and
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to
the Effective Time).

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
that may be necessary to ensure that no shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
$0.00001 par value, of the Company, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
$0.00001 par value of the Company, and no shares of any other series of
preferred stock of the Company are outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  



  

1.3 _Restricted Shares_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each Restricted Share held by any CB
Holder that is unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (after giving effect to any vesting that is contingent upon
the completion of the Merger) shall be cancelled, terminated and extinguished
by the Company.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
that may be necessary (under the Company 2016 Equity Incentive Plan
and otherwise) to (i) effectuate the provisions of this _Section 1.3_ and
_Section 1.2(b)_ and (ii) to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time
holders of Restricted Shares shall have no rights with respect thereto other
than those specifically provided in this _Section 1.3_ and in _Section
1.2(b)_.

  



    

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.4 _Options_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Vested Qualifying Options_. None of the Surviving
Company, GTY or Holdings will assume any Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable. Subject to a Vested Qualifying Option Holder providing
the Company with a duly completed and validly executed Option Cancellation
Agreement, each Vested Qualifying Option held by such Vested Qualifying
Option Holder that is unexpired and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive (A) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (a) that number of CB Common Shares for which such Vested
Qualifying Option is exercisable, multiplied by (b) the Per Option
Closing Cash Consideration, calculated as set forth in Schedule 1.2(b), which
Per Option Closing Cash Consideration will then be reduced by any applicable
Taxes; _plus_ (B) the amounts, if any, that become payable in respect of such
Vested Qualifying Option in the future from the Purchase Price Escrow
Account, _plus_ (C) the amounts, if any, that become payable in respect of
such Vested Qualifying Option in the future from the remaining balance of the
Expense Fund, if any, pursuant to _Section 10.18(e)_ ,  _plus_ (D) the
Earnout Consideration in accordance with _Exhibit_ B (the " _Per Option Merger
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(b) _Payments to Vested Qualifying Option Holders_. Any payments to
any Vested Qualifying Option Holder shall be to the Exchange Agent
for further payment, as soon as practicable, to the Surviving Company.
Holdings or GTY will cause the Surviving Company to pay to holders of Vested
Qualifying Options, through the Surviving Company's payroll processing system
or other appropriate account, any such payments as soon as practicable, net
of applicable Tax withholding. The payment of the Earnout Consideration shall
be made in accordance with _Exhibit B_.

The aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, the aggregate Per Option Merger
Consideration, and the Merger Shares, are referred to herein, collectively, as
the " _Merger Consideration_." The funds and shares provided to the Exchange
Agent are referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall,

(e) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, GTY and
Holdings shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of CB Shares entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)_ : (i) a letter of
transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify the delivery of any certificates
evidencing the CB Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the certificates evidencing the Merger Consideration
shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to such Letter
of Transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation, together with such
Letter of Transmittal (solely if required by the Exchange Agent), duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the portion of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)_ and _Section 1.6(a)(i)_
 (which, with respect to any Merger Shares, shall be in book-entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of CB Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)_ may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such CB Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.6_ , each
Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the portion of the
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
1.2(b)_ and _Section 1.6(a)(i)_.

  



  

(f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the Merger Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the Merger Shares represented thereby, until the holder of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Merger Shares issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
theretofore paid with respect to such Merger Shares, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such Merger
Shares.

  



  

(g) No certificates evidencing fractional Merger Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and in lieu
thereof, each Person who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
Merger Share shall receive, in lieu of such fractional share, cash in an
amount equal to the value of such fractional share.

  



    

 | -7-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
any holders of CB Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any CB Holders who have
not theretofore complied with this _Section 1.6_  shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Company for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by CB Holders as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Exchange Agent, GTY, Holdings, the Surviving Company or any
other Person shall be liable to any CB Holder or to any other Person for any
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably required by
Holdings, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Holdings may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the consideration into
which the CB Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
shall have been converted.

  



  

1.7 _Closing Date Statement_. No later than two (2) Business Days
before the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to GTY a statement (the "
_Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth or attaching, as applicable:

  



  

(a) the Company's good faith estimate of Closing Date Cash (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash Amount_ ") and Closing Date Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount_ "); and

  



  

(b) the resulting calculation of the Cash Consideration.

  



  

1.8 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination_.

  



  

(a) After Closing, Holdings shall cause to be prepared and, within
sixty (60) days after Closing, Holdings shall cause to be delivered to the CB
Holders' Representative, a statement (together with reasonable supporting
documentation) setting forth the GTY Parties' determination of (i) Closing
Date Cash and (ii) Closing Date Indebtedness (the " _Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement_ ").

  



  

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Company shall permit the CB
Holders' Representative and its counsel, accountants and other
advisors reasonable access (during normal business hours, with the right to
make copies) to the financial and other relevant books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case for the purposes of the review and
objection right and dispute process contemplated in this _Section 1.8_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.8(b)_ , the
Company shall not be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to, grant access to or furnish information to the CB Holders'
Representative to the extent that (a) such information is subject to an
attorney/client or attorney work product privilege or (b) such access or the
furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



    

 | -8-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If the CB Holders' Representative disagrees with the Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement, the CB Holders' Representative shall notify
Holdings in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, which notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the nature of such disagreement, including the
specific items involved and the dollar amounts thereof (a " _Purchase Price
Dispute Notice_ "). Any component of Holdings' Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement that is not the subject of an objection by the CB Holders'
Representative shall be final and binding on the Parties and deemed to be
part of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If the CB Holders'
Representative does not deliver a Purchase Price Dispute Notice within such
30-day period, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as delivered by
Holdings to the CB Holders' Representative, shall be the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement. If the CB Holders' Representative does deliver a
Purchase Price Dispute Notice within such 30-day period (the aggregate amount
in dispute as set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice, the " _Disputed
Amounts_ "), then the Disputed Amounts shall be resolved pursuant to _Section
1.8(d)_.

  



  

(d) Holdings and the CB Holders' Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any Disputed Amounts and, if the Parties are able to
resolve all Disputed Amounts, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as
modified to reflect such resolution, shall be the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement. If Holdings and the CB Holders' Representative are
unable to resolve all Disputed Amounts within twenty (20) days after delivery
of the CB Holders' Representative's Purchase Price Dispute Notice, then the
Disputed Amounts shall be referred for final determination to a mutually
agreed upon nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants, which does not have any material relationship with GTY, Holdings,
the CB Holders' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates (such
firm, or any successor thereto, the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ")
within fifteen (15) days after the end of such 20-day period. If Holdings and
the CB Holders' Representative are unable to agree upon an Accounting
Arbitrator within such 15-day period, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
an accounting firm of national standing designated by the American
Arbitration Association in New York, New York which does not have any
material relationship with Holdings, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates. The CB Holders' Representative and Holdings shall execute any
agreement reasonably required by the Accounting Arbitrator for its engagement
hereunder. The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only those Disputed
Amounts which Holdings and the CB Holders' Representative have been unable to
resolve. The Accounting Arbitrator will act as an expert (not an arbitrator)
and may select as a resolution the position of either Holdings or the CB
Holders' Representative for each Disputed Amount (based solely on
presentations and supporting material provided by the Parties and not
pursuant to any independent review) or may impose an alternative resolution
which cannot be higher than the highest value or lower than the lowest value
presented by each Party for a disputed amount. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall deliver to Holdings and the CB Holders' Representative, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after its
appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of such Disputed
Amounts. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Parties. In
selecting such resolution, the Accounting Arbitrator shall rely solely on the
terms of this Agreement and on written submissions and supporting material
provided by Holdings and the CB Holders' Representative, and at the
Accounting Arbitrator's election, pursuant to responses provided by Holdings
and the CB Holders' Representative to inquiries posed by the Accounting
Arbitrator's review of the foregoing, but not pursuant to an independent
review. Upon the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement, as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the
Accounting Arbitrator's decision (and as otherwise adjusted in accordance
with this _Article 1_ ), shall be the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
allocated to and borne by Holdings and the CB Holders' Representative (on
behalf of the CB Holders) based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Accounting Arbitrator's determination (before such allocation) bears to the
Disputed Amount as originally submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator. For
example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the
Accounting Arbitrator awards $600 in favor of the CB Holders'
Representative's position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
Holdings and 40% of the costs would be borne by the CB
Holders' Representative.

Exchange Agent for the benefit of the CB Holders, and

  



  

(ii) Holdings shall promptly pay to the Exchange Agent the Adjustment

all of the funds contained therein as follows:

  



  

(i) to Holdings, an amount equal to the lesser of: (x) the balance
of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, or (y) the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount; and

  



  

(ii) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than the
balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, to the Exchange Agent the
remainder of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, for the benefit of the CB
Holders.

  



    

 | -10-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) To the extent that the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount
exceeds the balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, Holdings shall be
entitled to recover such excess adjustment amount, at its option in its sole
discretion, from the Indemnity Escrow Account or directly from the CB Holders
on a several basis.

  



  

(e) Any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 1.9_ shall be paid
(or joint instruction to the Escrow Agent shall be provided) within two (2)
Business Days after final determination pursuant to _Section 1.8_ of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Party receiving such payment.

  



  

(f) The CB Holders' Representative and Holdings agree to treat any
payment made pursuant to this _Section 1.9_ as an adjustment to the purchase
price for federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes.

  



  

1.10 _Escrowed Portion of the Purchase Price_. For the purpose of
securing the CB Holders' obligations under _Section 1.9_ , at the Closing,
Holdings shall deliver or cause to be delivered $100,000 in cash (the "
_Purchase Price Escrow Amount_ ") to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account (the " _Purchase Price Escrow
Account_ ") that will be designated and administered by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement will provide, among
other things, that all amounts in the Purchase Price Escrow Account will be
released in accordance with the amounts provided on the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement and paid pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

  



  

1.11 _Withholding_. GTY, Holdings, the Surviving Company, the
Exchange Agent and their Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person (including payments of the Cash Purchase Price, the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Purchase Price Escrow Amount, the Expense Fund
Amount and the Earnout Consideration) such amounts as GTY, Holdings, the
Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent, or any Affiliate thereof are required
to deduct and withhold therefrom under the Code, or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable legal
requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid
over to the proper Governmental Body in accordance with all applicable Laws,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

1.12 _Closing_. The consummation of the Transaction (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at the offices of Winston and Strawn LLP in New York, New
York, or remotely via electronic exchange of documents and signatures,
commencing at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the second (2nd) Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions of the Parties to

respective Parties will take at the Closing itself) or such other date as the
Parties may mutually agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such
filing, and GTY shall thereafter, in compliance with the relevant

or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. The Parties acknowledge that a substantial portion of
the Registration Statement and certain other forms, reports and other
filings required to be made by GTY and/or Holdings under the Securities Act

material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that GTY
shall not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information
furnished in writing by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement). GTY
and Holdings shall each make all necessary filings with respect to the
Transaction under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act
and applicable blue sky Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. GTY,
acting through the GTY Board, shall include in the Proxy Statement the

the Transaction (including the Signing Press Release and the Closing Press
Release) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. If, at any time

or circumstance relating to the CB Holders, the Company Parties or the
Business, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, managers
or employees or their respective management, operations or financial
condition, which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the

deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by each Company
Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan during the plan year of such Company
Benefit Plan in which occurs the later of the Closing Date and the date on
which each Company Employee begins participating in such GTY Plan.

  



  

(b) Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ , (i) is intended to, or will be
construed to, confer upon any Company Employee or any other Person other than

right to continued employment; or (ii) will establish, amend or be deemed to
establish or amend any Company Benefit Plan, GTY Plan or any other benefit
plan, program, policy or arrangement of any GTY Party or will limit the

all Taxes that are shown as payable with respect to CB Prepared Returns. All
CB Prepared Returns shall be prepared in accordance with existing procedures,
practices, and accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to

 | -50-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Holdings shall cause the relevant Company Party to prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns of the Company Parties due (after taking
into account all appropriate extensions) after the Closing Date (the " _GTY
Prepared Returns_ "). To the extent that a GTY Prepared Return relates to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and accounting
methods, and, to the extent applicable, the conventions provided in _Section
5.4(a)(iii)_, unless required otherwise by Law. Each GTY Prepared Return that
shows an Indemnified Tax shall be submitted to the CB Holders' Representative
a reasonable time prior to (but no later than 30 days prior to) the due date
of such Tax Return. Holdings shall incorporate any reasonable comments made
by the CB Holders' Representative in the final Tax Return prior to filing. No
failure or delay of Holdings in providing GTY Prepared Returns for the CB
Holders' Representative to review shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligations or liabilities of the CB Holders pursuant to this Agreement except
to the extent the CB Holders are actually prejudiced by such delay or
failure. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
Transaction Tax Deductions shall, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, be reflected on the Tax Returns of the Company for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods (including the pre-Closing portion of Straddle Periods), as the
case may be.

  



  

(iii) The CB Holders' Representative, the CB Holders, Holdings and GTY
agree with respect to certain Tax matters as follows:

  



  

(A) The Tax years of the Company Parties organized under U.S. Tax
Laws shall end for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as of the end of the
Closing Date and, to the extent permissible under applicable Laws, the Company
Parties shall elect to have each of its other Tax years end as of the end of
the Closing Date.

  



  

(B) To treat all indemnification payments under this Agreement as
adjustments to the Cash Purchase Price for all relevant Tax purposes.

  



  

(C) To treat all interest and other earnings on the Purchase Price
Escrow Account and Indemnity Escrow Account as income of GTY in
accordance with the transition rule set forth in Proposed Treasury Regulation
Section 1.468B-8(h)(2).

  



  

(D) That no election under Code Section 338(g) or Code Section 336(e)
shall be made with respect to the acquisition (or sale) of the shares of any
Company Party contemplated by this Agreement.

  



    

 | -51-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(E) That without the prior written consent of the CB Holders'
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), Holdings and the Surviving Company shall not (i) file or amend any
Tax Return of the Company Parties that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or Straddle Period) except as contemplated pursuant to _Section 5.4(a)(ii)_ ,
extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any statute of
limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency
related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or Straddle Period), (iii) make or
change any Tax election or accounting method or practice that has retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date), or (iv) initiate any voluntary disclosure or
other communication with any Governmental Body relating to any actual or
potential Tax payment or Tax Return filing obligation of the Company Parties
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or Straddle Period).

  



  

Unless otherwise required by Law, neither the CB Holders nor Holdings shall
take any position (and Holdings shall not allow any Company Party or any of
its other Affiliates to take any position) during the course of any audit or
other Proceeding with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns (whether or not a
Tax Contest) that is inconsistent with any election, position, or agreement
provided for in this _Section 5.4(a)(iii)_.

  



  

(b) _Apportionment of Taxes_. For purposes of determining the
amount of Taxes that are attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion
of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) the parties agree as
follows:

  



  

(i) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on
a periodic basis for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

  



  

(ii) In the case of Taxes in the form of interest or penalties, all
such Taxes shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) to the extent
relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date) whether such items are incurred, accrued,
assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the Closing Date.

  



  

(iii) In the case of Taxes imposed on any Company Party, Holdings or
any other GTY Indemnitee as a result of income of any Flow-Thru
Entity realized prior to the Closing Date (such income being computed
assuming the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends on the Closing Date and
closed its books), such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes of the relevant
Company Party for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(iv) In the case of payroll and other employment Taxes of any Company
Party with respect to any transaction-related bonuses or Options paid on or
before, or within a short period of time after, the Closing Date or any other
Taxes imposed on any Company Party with respect to the payment of any
Transaction Expenses of a Company Party made on or before, or within a short
period of time after, the Closing Date, such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes
of the relevant Company Party for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



    

 | -52-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v) In the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including
income Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes) the
amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined as if the relevant Company Party filed a
separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing
of the books methodology." For purposes of this clause (v), any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates) shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
based on the mechanics set forth in clause (i) for periodic Taxes.

  



  

(c) _Cooperation_. GTY, Holdings, the Company, the CB Holders'
Representative and each CB Holder shall (i) assist in the preparation and
timely filing of any Tax Return of any Company Party; (ii) assist in any
audit or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Company
Party (whether or not a Tax Contest); (iii) make available any information,
records, or other documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Company or any Subsidiary of any Company Party; (iv) provide any information
necessary or reasonably requested to allow Holdings or any relevant Company
Party to comply with any information reporting or withholding
requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Laws or to compute the
amount of payroll or other employment Taxes due with respect to any payment
made in connection with this Agreement; and (v) provide certificates or forms,
and timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate to
establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax.

  



  

(d) _Tax Contests_. Holdings shall control, or cause the applicable
Company Party to control, the conduct of any audit or other
Proceeding relating to Taxes of any Company Party (a " _Tax Contest_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the CB Holders' Representative, at the sole
cost and expense of the CB Holders, shall have the right to participate in any
such Tax Contest to the extent it relates solely to Taxes for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period and Holdings shall incorporate any timely and reasonable
comments made by the CB Holders' Representative with respect to any
documentation related to such Tax Contest. Holdings shall not settle any such
Tax Contest without the consent of the CB Holders' Representative (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

  



  

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local, non-U.S. transfer,
excise, sales, use, ad valorem value added, registration, stamp,
recording, property and similar Taxes or fees applicable to, imposed upon, or
arising out of the transfer of the shares in the Company or any other

penalties (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid fifty-percent

Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as determined in accordance with
the same principles provided for in _Section 5.4(b)_) (whether in the form

of the CB Holders. GTY will cooperate with the CB Holders' Representative,
and take reasonable steps requested by the CB Holders' Representative, to
obtain any such refund.

Holders, GTY or Holdings, as applicable shall pay to the Exchange Agent for
distribution to the CB Holders the amount of such refund (without interest
other than interest received from the Governmental Body), net of (i) any Taxes
imposed on GTY, Holdings or such Company Party, or any of their Affiliates,
as a result of the receipt of such refund; and (ii) any reasonable
expenses that GTY, Holdings, a Company Party, or any of their Affiliates
incurred with respect to such refund. The net amount due to the CB Holders
shall be payable ten (10) days after receipt of the refund from the applicable
Governmental Body (or, if the refund is in the form of direct credit, ten
(10) days after filing the Tax Return claiming such credit).

  



  

(iii) Nothing in this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall require that GTY or
Holdings make any payment with respect to any refund for a Tax (and
such refunds shall be for the benefit of GTY, Holdings or the applicable
Company Party) that is with respect to any refund of Tax that is the result
of the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax
credit incurred in a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date).

  



  

(g) _Tax Treatment_. None of GTY, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any action that would
reasonably be likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as part of a
transaction described in Section 351 of the Code (" _351 Transaction_ ") and
prior to the Effective Time, GTY, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective Affiliates shall use their best efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify as part of a 351 Transaction.

quoted) from and after the Effective Time.

7.1 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by CB Escrow Participants_. Effective at and
after the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article 7_
, the CB Escrow Participants shall indemnify and hold harmless GTY, Holdings,
their Affiliates and their and their Affiliates' respective officers,
directors, attorneys, accountants, representatives, agents, successors and
assigns (such Persons, including the Company and its Subsidiaries from and
after the Closing, collectively, the " _GTY Indemnitees_ ") from and
against any Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any
breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of any Company

indirect ownership of any Holdings Common Stock, or rights thereto, issued as
equity consideration pursuant to this Agreement, or (b) have any claim or
right to contribution or indemnity from any GTY Indemnitee (including any
claim or right pursuant to _Section 5.2_ ) with respect to any Loss paid by
the CB Escrow Participants pursuant to this _Article 7_. For the avoidance of
doubt, any Taxes (and related Losses) resulting from a breach of a Tax
Representation shall be governed by _Section 7.1(a)(v)_ rather than _Section
7.1(a)(i)_ and any Taxes (and related Losses) resulting from a breach of a
covenant by the Company to be performed on or prior to the Closing or a
breach of a covenant to be performed by the CB Escrow Participants pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Transaction document shall be governed by
_Section 7.1(a)(v)_ rather than _Section 7.1(a)(ii)_.

  



  

(b) _Indemnification by GTY and Holdings_. Effective at and after
the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article 7_ ,
GTY and Holdings shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each
CB Holder and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, attorneys, accountants, representatives, agents, successors and
assigns (such Persons, excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries from and
after the Closing, collectively, the " _CB Holder Indemnitees_ ") from and
against any Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any
breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of any GTY Party

 | -58-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.2 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Survival_.

  



  

(i) The representations and warranties in this Agreement and any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive the
Closing until the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date, except that the (i) Fundamental Representations shall survive until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable
to the subject matter (after giving effect to any waiver, tolling mitigation
or extension) thereof, and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth
in _Section 2.11_  shall survive until the date that is twenty-four (24)
months following the Closing Date.

  



  

(ii) The covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the date
that is ninety (90) days after such covenants have been performed in
accordance with their terms, except that the covenants set forth in _Section
5.4_ shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until sixty
(60) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations period
applicable to the underlying subject matter (after giving effect to any
waiver, tolling, mitigation or extension thereof).

  



  

(iii) Any claim related to any intentional and knowing fraud by the
Company may be made at any time without limitation.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim made under and in accordance with
this _Article 7_ prior to the expiration of the applicable period set forth
above shall survive until such claim is finally resolved. No knowledge of, or
investigation by or on behalf of, any party hereto will constitute a waiver
of such party's right to enforce any covenant, representation or warranty
contained herein against any of the other parties or affect the right of a
party to indemnification.

  



  

(b) _Threshold_. Subject to the other limitations set forth in this
Agreement, including this _Section 7.2_ , no amount shall be payable by any
Indemnifying Party pursuant to, under, relating to or in connection with
_Section 7.1(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses
otherwise payable in connection with such breach exceeds an amount equal to
$500,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), after which the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for all Losses and not just those Losses that are in excess of the
Threshold, subject to the other provisions of this _Section 7.2_ ; _provided_
, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply in respect of any Losses
relating to (y) any breach of Fundamental Representation, or (z) any
intentional and knowing fraud by the Company. With respect to any claim for
which any GTY Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)(i)_ , other than with respect to the Fundamental Representations, no
amount shall be payable by any Indemnifying Party unless and until
such amounts, together with all Losses arising from the same facts and
circumstances, in the aggregate, exceed $50,000.

  



    

 | -59-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Liability Cap_.

  



  

(i) $10,000,000 shall serve as the maximum liability of any
Indemnifying Party which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Party pursuant
to, under, relating to or in connection with _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ ; _provided_
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply in respect of any Losses
relating to (i) any breach of any Fundamental Representation, (ii) any knowing
and intentional fraud by the Company or (iii) any breach of or inaccuracy in
any of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.11_, in
which case the maximum liability of any Indemnifying Party under this clause
(iii) shall be $15,000,000.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event
shall a CB Escrow Participant be liable for an amount greater than the sum of
the Cash Purchase Price actually received by the CB Escrow Participant, plus
the Earnout Consideration in the form and to the extent actually received by
such CB Escrow Participant.

  



  

(d) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification
under this _Article 7_ will be calculated net of the amount of any insurance
proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Parties in connection with such
Losses or any of the events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related
to such Losses (net of all deductibles, co-payments, retro-premium obligations
and premium increases attributable thereto and all costs of collection of any
such other insurance proceeds). If any such other insurance proceeds
are received by any GTY Indemnitee after receiving payment or reimbursement
for any Losses hereunder, GTY will promptly cause to be paid to the Exchange
Agent (on behalf of the CB Escrow Participants) an amount equal to the lesser
of such insurance proceeds or the amount of such Losses previously paid or
reimbursed in connection with the related clauses.

  



  

(e) Each Party will take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
Losses upon or after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to Losses indemnifiable by the other Party, in each
case, to the extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

(f) Subject to the other terms and limitations of this _Article 7_ :

  



  

(i) any Losses payable to a GTY Indemnitee pursuant to, under,
relating to or in connection with _Section 7.1(a)(i)-(vi)_ shall be satisfied
(A) first from the Cash Escrow Amount, and (B) second, to the extent the
amount of recoverable Losses exceeds the amounts available to the GTY
Indemnitees from the Cash Escrow Amount, from the CB Escrow Participants,
severally and not jointly (in accordance with their Escrow Participation
Percentages).

  



  

(ii) any Losses payable to a GTY Indemnitee pursuant to, under,
relating to or in connection with _Section 7.1(a)(vii)_ shall be
satisfied (A) first from the Schedule 7.1 Escrow Amount, (B) second, to the
extent the amount of recoverable Losses exceeds the amounts available to the
GTY Indemnitees from the Schedule 7.1 Escrow Amount, from the Cash Escrow
Amount, and (C) third, to the extent the amount of recoverable Losses exceeds
the amounts available to the GTY Indemnitees from the Cash Escrow Amount, from
the CB Escrow Participants, severally and not jointly (in accordance with
their Escrow Participation Percentages).

  



    

 | -60-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) GTY, Holdings and Merger Sub acknowledge, covenant and agree
that (i) GTY, Holdings and Merger Sub have conducted an independent
investigation, review and analysis of the business of the Company and the
Company's business operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations,
financial condition, technology and prospects in making its determination as
to the propriety of the Transaction; (ii) in entering into this Agreement,
GTY, Holdings and Merger Sub have relied solely on the results of such
investigation, review and analysis and not on any factual representations or
opinions of the Company other than the representations and warranties of
the Company expressly contained in _Article 2_ of this Agreement; and (iii)
except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article 2_ of
this Agreement, none of Company or its Affiliates or representatives nor any
other Person makes any other express, implied or statutory representation or
warranty with respect to the Company, the Merger or otherwise, including any
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
title, enforceability or noninfringement. In connection with
such investigation, GTY and its representatives and Affiliates have received
from or on behalf of the Company certain estimates, budgets, forecasts, plans
and financial projections (" _Forward-Looking Statements_ "), and GTY,
Holdings and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
making Forward-Looking Statements and that Holdings, GTY and Merger Sub
are familiar with such uncertainties and are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Forward-
Looking Statements furnished to them and their representatives (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying Forward-Looking Statements where
such assumptions are explicitly disclosed), and that none of the Company or
any other Person has made or makes any representation or warranty with
respect to any Forward-Looking Statements. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.2(f)_ shall limit any rights of the
GTY Indemnitees hereunder with respect to the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article 2_.

  



  

(h) GTY Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Losses (i)
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that GTY Indemnitees have already recovered Losses with respect to such
matter pursuant to another provision of this Agreement or (ii) taken into
account in the calculation of Debt.

  



  

(i) _Tax Benefits_. For purposes of determining the amount of any
Loss for which indemnification is provided pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , the
amount of such Loss shall be reduced by the Indemnification Tax Benefits
actually realized, if any, by an Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates)
arising from the facts or circumstances giving rise to such Losses in the year
in which such Loss occurs. If an Indemnified Party realizes an
Indemnification Tax Benefit in any of the two (2) years following the
occurrence of such Loss, the Indemnified Party shall pay the Indemnifying
Party the amount of such Indemnification Tax Benefit. For this purpose, a
Person shall be deemed to recognize a Tax benefit (" _Indemnification Tax
Benefit_ ") with respect to a taxable year if, and to the extent that, the
Person's liability for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by excluding
any Tax items attributed to the Losses, exceeds the Person's actual liability
for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax
items attributed to the Losses.

  



    

 | -61-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.3 _Notice of Loss; Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) If a GTY Indemnitee or a CB Holder Indemnitee (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") intends to make a claim for Losses under this _Article
7_ , then the Indemnified Party shall give the party or parties obligated to
provide indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_ (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") prompt written notice (a " _Breach Notice_ ") of such Indemnifiable
Matter which the Indemnified Party has determined has given or would give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Agreement within thirty (30) days of
such determination, setting forth (i) a brief description of the nature of
the Indemnifiable Matter, (ii) the underlying representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement alleged to have been breached and the facts then known
as it relates to the Indemnifiable Matter, (iii) the total amount of the
actual out-of-pocket Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any
costs or expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection
therewith), if known and quantifiable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this _Article 7_ , except to
the extent that such failure shall have materially adversely affected the
ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against or reduce its or the
Indemnified Party's liability. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Breach Notice to dispute the contents of the Breach
Notice. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to
resolve the disputes to the Breach Notice, if any, within thirty (30) days of
the Indemnifying Party's receipt of the Breach Notice, the Indemnified Party
shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified
Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any notices to be delivered to
the CB Escrow Participants, as collectively the Indemnifying Party, shall be
delivered to the CB Holders' Representative, acting on behalf of the CB Escrow
Participants.

  



  

(b) If an Indemnified Party receives notice of any Proceeding with
respect to an Indemnifiable Matter which may give rise to a claim for Losses
under this _Article 7_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party
shall promptly give the Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third-Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its
obligations under this _Article 7_ , except to the extent that such failure
shall have adversely affected the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend
against or reduce its or the Indemnified Party's liability. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, at its option, by written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the entire control of the defense, compromise or
settlement of the Third-Party Claim, and shall be entitled to appoint a
recognized and reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim:

  



  

(i) the Indemnifying Party shall diligently and in good faith defend
such Third-Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified Party
reasonably informed of the status of such defense;

  



  

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof,
including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all information and
documents related to such Third-Party Claim; and

  



    

 | -62-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) the Indemnified Party (A) may participate in such defense and
retain one law firm reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party at the
Indemnifying Party's expense if the Indemnified Party has been advised by
outside legal counsel that there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or that there are one or more
legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or (B) may
participate in such defense at the Indemnified Party's expense in all other
circumstances.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.3(b)_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or conduct the defense of
any Third-Party Claim (without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, in its sole discretion) if (i) such Third-Party Claim relates to
or arises in connection with any criminal action, subpoena, criminal
investigative demand, criminal investigation or criminal proceeding of a
Governmental Body, (ii) such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against any Indemnified Party, (iii) the assumption of the
defense of the Third-Party Claim would have, in the good faith judgment of the
Indemnified Party, a material adverse effect on the business relationship
between the Indemnified Party and any Persons with whom it has material
business dealings, (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect
to, the Third-Party Claim is, in the good faith judgment of the
Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice
adverse to the continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party, or (v)
the Indemnifying Party has not agreed and acknowledged in writing for the
benefit of the Indemnified Party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party as provided hereunder with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article 7_. If the
Indemnifying Party (i) does not elect to defend the Indemnified Party against
a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely
notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, (ii) after assuming the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to take steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third-Party Claim or (iii) is not entitled to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim pursuant to the first sentence
of this _Section 7.3_ , the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not
the obligation to, assume such defense and shall have the sole power to
direct and control such defense, with counsel of its choosing it being
understood that the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third-
Party Claim (including the payment of the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Indemnified Party's counsel by the Indemnifying Party) shall not be adversely
affected by assuming the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party may enter into a settlement or consent to any judgment without the
consent of the Indemnified Party so long as (i) such settlement or judgment
involves monetary damages only which are indemnifiable in full by the
Indemnifying Party, (ii) a term of the settlement or judgment is that the
Person or Persons asserting such Third-Party Claim unconditionally release all

circumstances in which such amount is due and payable, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the Parties, whether arising at law or
in equity, whether in contract, tort, under statute or otherwise, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of

limitations period applicable to any such claim, controversy or dispute,
but without regard to any borrowing statute that would result in the
application of the statute of limitations of any other jurisdiction), without
giving effect to any law, provision or rule (whether of the State of New York
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

  



  

10.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing

virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  



  

10.10 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges
and agrees that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
unique and irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and in
the event of breach of this Agreement by a Party, the non-breaching Party
would not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.
Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which the non-

provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without

nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transaction is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transaction be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

(a) Each CB Holder shall be deemed to have appointed Shareholder
Representative Services LLC (the " _CB Holders ' Representative_") to serve
as CB Holders' Representative and as the representative, agent and attorney-
in-fact for and on behalf of each of the CB Holders for all purposes in
connection with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, including
to give and receive notices and communications in connection with this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and the Transaction, to take all
actions on behalf of the CB Holders pursuant to this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of CB Holders' Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. More specifically and without limiting the foregoing, CB Holders'
Representative shall have the authority to make all decisions and
determinations and to take all actions (including giving Consents or agreeing
to any amendments to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or to the
termination hereof or thereof) required or permitted hereunder on behalf of
each CB Holder, and any such action, decision or determination so made or
taken shall be deemed the action, decision or determination of each CB Holder,
and, after the Closing, any notice, communication, document, certificate or
information required (other than any notice required by Law) to be given to
any such CB Holder hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement shall be
deemed so given if given to CB Holders' Representative. CB
Holders' Representative shall be authorized to take all actions on behalf of
CB Holders in connection with any claims made under _Article 7_ of this
Agreement, to defend or settle such claims, and to make payments in respect of
such claims on behalf of the CB Holders. No bond shall be required of CB
Holders' Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or
from CB Holders' Representative shall constitute notice to or from each CB

 | -92-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The CB Holders' Representative will incur no liability of any
kind with respect to any action or omission, while acting in good faith, by
the CB Holders' Representative in connection with its services pursuant to
this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the CB Holders' Representative's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The CB Holders' Representative shall not be
liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The CB
Holders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the CB Holders'
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively,  "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the CB
Holders' Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the CB Holders' Representative,
the CB Holders' Representative will reimburse the CB Holders the amount of
such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the CB Holders'
Representative by the CB Holders, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the CB Holders' Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense
Fund, (ii) the amounts in any of the escrow funds held by the Escrow Agent at
such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the CB
Holders, and (iii) from any portion of the Earnout Amount at such time as any
such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the CB Holders; provided,
that while this section allows the CB Holders' Representative to be paid from
the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the CB Holders
from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the CB Holders' Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will
the CB Holders' Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf
of the CB Holders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification
obligations of the CB Holders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the CB
Holders' Representative under this section. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (including _Section 10.17_ ), this _Section 10.18_
shall in all events be binding upon, and enforceable by the CB Holders'
Representative against, the CB Holders. The foregoing indemnities will
survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the CB Holders'
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of CB Holders'
Representative shall constitute a decision of all CB Holders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon all CB Holders. GTY is hereby entitled to
rely on all statements, representations and decisions of CB Holders'
Representative and shall have no liability to the Company Parties, CB Holders
and CB Holders' Representative in connection with any actions taken or not
taken in reliance on such statements, representations and decisions of CB
Holders' Representative.

  



  

(d) CB Holders' Representative, for itself only, represents and
warrants that CB Holders' Representative has the limited liability company
capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder, and this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by CB Holders' Representative and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the other parties, constitutes the legal
and binding obligations of CB Holders' Representative, enforceable against CB
Holders' Representative in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors generally and by the
availability of equitable remedies and subject to the Laws of agency.

  



  

(e) Upon the Closing, the Company will wire to the CB Holders'
Representative an amount equal to $300,000 (the " _Expense Fund Amount_ "),
which will be held by the CB Holders' Representative in an account (the "
_Expense Fund_ ") and used for the purposes of paying directly, or
reimbursing the CB Holders' Representative for, any third party
expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The
CB Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and
irrevocably transfer and assign to the CB Holders' Representative any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The CB Holders' Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The CB Holders' Representative will hold these funds
separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these
funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as
practicable following the completion of the CB Holders' Representative's
responsibilities, the CB Holders' Representative shall disburse any remaining
balance of the Expense Fund to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to
the CB Holders. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund shall be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the CB Holders at the time of
Closing. The CB Holders' Representative is not acting as a withholding agent
or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund and is not
responsible for any tax reporting or withholding with respect thereto.

10.19 _Representation of Company and CB Holders ' Representative_.
GTY and Holdings each agree, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of
its Affiliates, that Perkins Coie LLP may serve as counsel to any one or more
of the Company, the CB Holders and the CB Holders' Representative following
the Closing, or to any of their respective directors, managers, officers,
members, shareholders, partners, Affiliates, employees, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns in connection with any matters related
to this Agreement and the Transaction, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transaction notwithstanding any representation by Perkins Coie LLP prior to
the Closing Date of the Company. Each of GTY, Holdings and the Company hereby
(i) waives any claim they have or may have that Perkins Coie LLP has a
conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation, and (ii) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after
the Closing between any of GTY, Holdings, the Company and the CB Holders
(including the CB Holders' Representative ) or any of the Affiliates of
any of the CB Holders, Perkins Coie LLP may represent the CB Holders
(including the CB Holders' Representative) or any of the Affiliates of any of
the CB Holders in such dispute even though the interests of such person(s) may
be directly adverse to GTY, Holdings or the Company and even though Perkins
Coie LLP may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related
to such dispute. Each of GTY, Holdings and the Company also further agrees
that, as to all communications among Perkins Coie LLP and the Company and the
CB Holders (including the CB Holders' Representative) or any of the Affiliates
of any of the CB Holders, that were in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the CB Holders and shall be
controlled by the CB Holders and shall not pass to or be claimed by GTY,
Holdings or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between GTY, Holdings or the Company and a third person other
than a Party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Perkins Coie LLP to such third person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the CB Holders' Representative.
