governmental approvals, to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
approvals, qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed, have such approvals and be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, Section&nbsp;3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list
of all Subsidiaries of the Company and any joint ventures, partnerships or similar arrangements in which the Company or its Subsidiaries has a limited liability, partnership or other equity interest

Parent's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections&nbsp;302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Parent's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent's system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2017 and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and the Company's independent registered accountant has issued an

to Parent's auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board of Directors (i)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal control over financial reporting,

and any amounts required to repay any indebtedness of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that Parent elects to, or that Parent or the Company is required to,
repay or cause to be repaid in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (funds in such amount, the "<U>Merger Amounts</U>"). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
their obligations under this Agreement are not contingent or conditioned in any manner on obtaining any financing. Parent has provided the Company with accurate and complete copies of the executed
financing commitment letter, dated August&nbsp;14, 2018 (such letter, together with all annexes and exhibits attached thereto, the "<U>Commitment Letter</U>") from the
Financing Entities party thereto pursuant to which such Financing Entities have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide financing for the amounts set forth therein
for the purposes of funding the Merger Amounts. As of the execution and delivery hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified. As of the execution and delivery hereof, the Commitment
Letter (a)&nbsp;is in full force and effect and (b)&nbsp;constitutes the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties
thereto, in each case, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, or moratorium Laws, other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and general
principles of equity affecting the availability of specific performance and other equitable remedies. As of the execution and delivery hereof, no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto under the Commitment Letter and, to
the knowledge of Parent, the respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies relating to the
funding of the Financing covered thereby contemplated to be funded on the Closing Date, except as stated therein. As of the execution and delivery hereof, all fees required to be paid under the
Commitment Letter prior to the date hereof have been paid in full. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U>, Parent has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter to be funded on the Closing Date will not be
made available to Parent on the Closing Date. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties' rights in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U> are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary
damages, each of the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over
a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be
cumulative, except, in each case, as may be limited by <U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U>), and each Party hereby waives any objection to the availability of such injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement. In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U>, such Party shall not be required
to prove damages or obtain, furnish, provide or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
<U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U> and each Party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, providing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument. In addition, each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors
or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action
or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or the Merger in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, (ii)&nbsp;any claim
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii)&nbsp;to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (A)&nbsp;the suit, action or
proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B)&nbsp;the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C)&nbsp;this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;8.7</U>; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that nothing herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
