 WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the TBOC; 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of Directors_ ") has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii) determined that the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (iii) approved the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and (iv) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the " _Company Recommendation_ ");

ARTICLE II 

  

_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

   

    Section 2.1 _ _ _Effect on Capital Stock_.  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or common stock of Merger Sub: 

  

  

 (i) _ _ _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, subject to  _Section 2.1(c)_ and _Section 2.1(d)_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares, any Converted Shares, any Dissenting Shares and any shares of Company Common Stock underlying a Company Equity Award) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the following consideration on a per share basis, without interest: (i) $55.65 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock (including all uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ")) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including the right to receive, pursuant to  _Section 2.1(d)_, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and dividends pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, if any) upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

  

 (ii) _ _ _Cancellation of Company Common Stock; Certain Subsidiary Owned Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) (collectively, the " _Converted Shares_ ") shall be converted into such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of the Cash Consideration divided by the Parent Trading Price and (B) the Stock Consideration. 

  

      

  

 (iii) _ _ _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

    
 (b) _ _ _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of record who has complied with the applicable provisions of Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the TBOC prior to the Effective Time (" _Dissenting Shareholder Statute_ " and any such shares meeting the requirement of this sentence, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with the Dissenting Shareholder Statute (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the payment of such amounts as are payable in accordance with the Dissenting Shareholder Statute); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares under the Dissenting Shareholder Statute, then the right of such holder to any such payments shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any written demands, notices or instruments received by the Company pursuant to the Dissenting Shareholder Statute and or relating to the Dissenting Shareholder Statute or any alleged dissenter\'s or similar rights, and any withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parent\'s expense, to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands,  _provided_ , that Parent shall consult with the Company with respect to such negotiations and proceedings. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

    
 (c) _ _ _Certain Adjustments_.  If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, or any record date for any such purposes shall be established, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

   

    
 (d) _ _ _No Fractional Shares_.  No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the Merger a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount, rounded down to the nearest cent, determined _by multiplying_ (i) the Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent by (ii) the 

        

fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional Share Cash Amount_
"). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other
rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that would
otherwise have been issuable as part of the Merger Consideration.

  

    
 Section 2.2 _ _ _Exchange of Certificates_.  

  

    
 (a) _ _ _Appointment of Exchange Agent_.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in the Merger and shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to the Exchange Agent\'s responsibilities under this Agreement. 

  

    
 (b) _ _ _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.  Immediately prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, the Fractional Share Cash Amount) payable in the Merger at such time as is necessary for the payment to holders of Company Common Stock and shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, at Parent\'s election) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration payable in the Merger (such cash and certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "); _provided_ that the Exchange Fund shall not include any amounts or shares payable on account of any Converted Shares, any Dissenting Shares. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, _provided, however_ , that (i) any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that would prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or any Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. Any loss of any of the funds included in the Exchange Fund shall be for the account of Parent and shall not alter Parent\'s obligation to cause to be paid the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand. In the event that the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of all Cash Consideration and Fractional Share Cash Amounts (including as a result of any investment of the Exchange Fund), Parent shall promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Cash Consideration and Fractional Share Cash Amounts in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed by the Company, any amount payable in respect of Company Equity Awards shall not be deposited with the Exchange Agent but shall instead be paid through the payroll of the Company and its Affiliates in accordance with _Section 2.3_. 

  

    
 (c) _ _ _Exchange Procedures_.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates 

        

(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate)
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the Fractional
Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with

entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the

arrangements to provide such document or information to the other Party in a
manner that would not result in violation of Law, violation of a
confidentiality agreement, the loss or waiver of such privilege or
the disclosure of a trade secret.

 Section 5.4 _ _ _No Solicitation by the Company_.  

  

 (a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4_, the Company shall and shall cause each of its controlled Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives acting on the Company\'s behalf: (i) to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent and Parent\'s Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives) that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating a Company Takeover Proposal (other than, in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this _Section 5.4_ and limiting its communication exclusively to such referral), or (C) approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, or fail to enforce, any standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party; _provided_ that, if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, the Company may waive any such standstill provision applicable to any such persons to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a confidential Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board of Directors; _provided_ that the Company promptly informs Parent that it is taking such action and the identity of the party or parties with respect to which it is taking such action. 

        

 (b) The Company shall promptly following the date of this Agreement cause the termination of access of any third party to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any information of or regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) Anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_ notwithstanding, if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time that the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that did not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.4_ by the Company and if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to take the action described in the following clauses (i) and (ii) would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal (and such person\'s Representatives); _provided_ that the Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person (or such person\'s Representatives) provide or make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously provided to Parent, and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company Board of Directors makes a determination that a Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal or if the Company furnishes non-public information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided in this _Section 5.4(c)_. 

  

 (d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after, to the knowledge of the Company, its receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company directly or indirectly receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a request for information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or other inquiry or communication that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy of such Company Takeover Proposal or, where such Company Takeover Proposal is not in writing, a description of the terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, as to the status of (including any material developments, discussions or negotiations related thereto) such Company Takeover Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any correspondence, proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Company Takeover Proposal). The Company agrees that it and its Affiliates will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.4_. 

  

 (e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4(e)_, the Company Board of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus when disseminated to the Company\'s shareholders, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation, (C) fail to recommend against any Company Takeover Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender or exchange offer or after such tender or exchange offer is subsequently amended in any material respect or (D) adopt, approve or 

        

recommend to shareholders of the Company, or resolve to or publicly propose
or announce its intention to adopt, approve or recommend to shareholders of
the Company, a Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or
(ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
(including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement
or other similar agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with  _Section 5.4(c))_
(a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). Anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to the time that the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board of
Directors may, with respect to a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a material breach by the Company of this
_Section 5.4_, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, and only if,
prior to taking such action, (x) the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors\'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) (A) the Company has given
Parent at least four (4) Business Days\' prior written notice of its intention
to take such action, and specifying the reasons therefor, and has provided to
Parent the identity of the person making, any such Company Takeover Proposal
and a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements constituting such
Company Takeover Proposal (or, if not provided in writing to the Company, a
written summary of the material terms thereof) and a written summary of the
material terms of any financing commitments relating thereto, (B) if requested
by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall have engaged in good
faith in discussions and negotiations with Parent and its Representatives
during such notice period regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent so that the failure to take such action would
no longer be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors\' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (C) following the end of such notice period, the
Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent, and shall
have determined, after consultation with the Company\'s independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would
nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board of
Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law if the revisions committed
to in writing by Parent were to be given effect, and (D) in the event of any
change to any of the material financial terms or any other material terms of
such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case,
have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described
in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A)
of this proviso shall commence (except that the four (4) Business Day notice
period referred to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead end at
the later of (1) 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the second (2nd) Business Day
immediately following Parent\'s receipt of such notice and (2) the end of the
original notice period, during which time the Company shall be required
to comply with the requirements of clauses (B), (C) and (D) above of this
proviso. The actions of the Company Board of Directors in making a
determination that a Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal and the Company\'s authorizing and providing the notices to Parent
required by this _Section 5.4(e)_, if done in accordance with this _Section
5.4(e)_ and so long as the Company Board of Directors determines finally, at
the end of any notice periods required pursuant to this  _Section 5.4(e)_
with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal, that such Company Takeover
Proposal does not constitute a Company Superior Proposal and reaffirms
the Company Recommendation, shall not in and of itself, constitute a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, a violation of this _Section 5.4_ or trigger
any rights allowing for a termination of this Agreement. Anything to the
contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

        

 (f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company may, at any time prior to the date the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, but not after, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event (a " _Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ ") if, and only if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making such Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change, (i) the Company has given Parent at least four (4) Business Days\' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and specifying the reasons therefor, including specifying in reasonable detail the applicable Company Intervening Event and (ii) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with the Company\'s independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the actions of the Company Board of Directors in making such determination and the Company\'s authorizing and providing of such notice pursuant to this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall not, if done in accordance with _Section 5.4(f)_ and so long as the Company Board of Directors determines finally, at the end of any notice periods required pursuant to this  _Section 5.4(f)_, not to make a Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change and reaffirms the Company Recommendation, in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, a violation of this _Section 5.4_ or a termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder, (ii) directing any person (or the representative of that person) that makes a Company Takeover Proposal to the provisions of this _Section 5.4_ or (iii) making a factually accurate public statement limited to a description of the Company\'s receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ that in the case of either clause (i), (ii) or (iii) no such action, position or disclosure that would amount to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with  _Section 5.4(e)_. 

  

    
 Section 5.5 _ _ _Employee Matters_.  

  

 (a) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") for so long as such Company Employee remains employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation during the relevant period, (i) for one year following the Effective Time, a base salary or base wage rate no less than that provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) for the remainder of the fiscal year in effect as of the Effective Time, a target annual cash incentive opportunity no less favorable than that provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) for one year following the Effective Time, employee benefits (including equity-based compensation eligibility and severance benefits, and excluding any defined benefit retirement benefits and retiree welfare benefits) that are, in Parent\'s election, substantially comparable in the aggregate to (A) those generally provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) or (B) those generally provided to employees of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time 

        

(it being understood that the Company Employees may commence participation in
Parent\'s compensation and benefit plans on different dates following the
Effective Time with respect to different compensation and benefit plans).

  

 (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each Company Employee with the Company and its ERISA Affiliates prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan or plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Company Employee with respect to the same period of service, (iii) apply for purposes of any Post-Closing Plans (x) adopted after the Closing Date and under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable and good faith efforts to (A) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such Company Employee to the extent such limitation or waiting period would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) credit each Company Employee for an amount equal to any medical, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Company Employee in the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate in such Post-Closing Plan, for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan. 

  

 (c) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than ten (10) Business Days before the anticipated Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Company\'s 401(k) plans (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_"), effective as of the date prior to the Closing Date. Following the Effective Time, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Parent\'s applicable 401(k) plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_"), permit the Company Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans to participants), in the form of cash (or in the case of loans, notes), in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan. 

  

 (d) The Company shall submit any communications with any employees or service providers of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) employee benefits (other than those communications made in the ordinary course of business that do not relate to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (iii) post-Closing terms of employment, to Parent for its review, comment and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to distribution of such communications. 

  

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any 

        

Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Company Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of  _Section 8.13_ and any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in this
Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any person other
than the Parties hereto, including any Company Employee or current or former
service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

Parent shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, enter into a transaction to acquire any asset, property, right, business or Person (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, investment, joint venture, strategic alliance, other business combination, asset, stock or equity purchase or otherwise), that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ and _6.1(d)_. 

  

 (b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders, expiration or termination of waiting periods, or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.6_. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult with the other Parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Parties (or their counsel) copies of) all notices, submissions, or filings made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such Party to, or material correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Each Party to this Agreement shall (A) promptly inform the other Parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other Parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other Parties orally of) any material communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, (B) permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with, any proposed communication with any such Governmental Entity and (C) to the extent permitted by any applicable Governmental Entity, give the other Party a reasonable opportunity 

        

to attend and participate in any in-person meetings with such Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Parties agree
that it is Parent\'s primary right to devise the strategy for all filings,
notifications, submissions and communications in connection with any filing,
notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of information,
application or similar filing subject to this _Section 5.6_ after consulting
with, and taking into account in good faith any comments of, the Company or
its Representatives relating to such strategy. If any Party to this Agreement
or any Representative of such Parties receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger, then such Party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other Parties to
this Agreement in good faith, an appropriate response in substantial
compliance with such request. Each Party shall furnish the other Parties with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental
Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and furnish the other
Parties with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other Parties may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental
Entity; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and the Company may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this  _Section 5.6_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 5.6_ notwithstanding, materials provided pursuant to this _Section
5.6_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Merger or other confidential information, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns.

  

 (c) The Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR Act and appropriate filings, if any are required, pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable. In the event that the Parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process. The Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material that may be required under any other Antitrust Law and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under any other Antitrust Law prior to the End Date. 

  

 (d) Parent shall solely to the extent necessary to consummate and make effective the Merger (i) agree to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, or other disposition of or restriction on any assets, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and (ii) accept any operational restrictions or otherwise take or commit to take actions that would, after the Effective Time, limit Parent\'s or any of its Affiliates\' freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or businesses of any of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to take (and the Company shall not without the prior written consent of Parent agree to take) any of the actions set forth in clauses (i) or (ii), in each case, if any such action, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect (measured on a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) the business of Parent, the Company, and their Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, after the Closing Date and giving effect to the Merger. 

       

                                    

    

 (e) In the event that any litigation, claim, suit, action or proceeding is commenced challenging the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, claim, suit, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order resulting therefrom, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 5.7 _ _ _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/ Prospectus; Company Shareholders Meeting_.  

  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form, and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company Special Meeting. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other party on any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4. The foregoing notwithstanding, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response), except to the extent such disclosures relate to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions. 

  

 (b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so 

        

that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law,
in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
shareholders of the Company. Nothing in this _Section 5.7(b)_ shall limit the
obligations of any Party under  _Section 5.7(a)_.

  

 (c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent and in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Company\'s shareholders to consider the proposal to adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Special Meeting_ "). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Special Meeting and to hold the Company Special Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, make the Company Recommendation, include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, except, in each case, during such time as a valid Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with  _Section 5.4_ is in effect. The Company shall not submit any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Company Special Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Special Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Law. The foregoing provisions of this  _Section 5.7(c)_ notwithstanding, if, on a date for which the Company Special Meeting is scheduled, the Company (i) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that any supplement or amendment to the disclosure documents is required by Law to be provided to the Company\'s shareholders or (ii) has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to constitute a quorum or obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Special Meeting; _provided_ that, without the prior written consent of Parent, in no event may the Company Special Meeting be postponed to later than the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after the date for which the Company Special Meeting was originally scheduled. All other postponements or adjournments shall require the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to excuse the Company or the Company Board of Directors from complying with its unqualified obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders at the Company Special Meeting, and neither the Company nor the Company Board of Directors shall submit to the vote of its shareholders any Company Takeover Proposal other than the Merger, in each case without regard to whether a Company Takeover Proposal has been made or whether the Company Board of Directors has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Company Board of Directors has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as expressly permitted by _Section 5.4_, then the Company Board of Directors may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended) _and_ to the extent so requested by the Company to disclose (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) a statement of the reason of the Company Board of Directors for making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and Parent shall cooperate regarding, and shall promptly file with the SEC, any necessary amendment of, or supplement, to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4, and to the extent required by Law, shall cooperate in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to shareholders of the Company. 

        

    
 Section 5.8 _ _ _Takeover Statutes_.  The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-takeover Laws becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Merger, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 5.9 _ _ _Public Announcements_.  Without limiting _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.7_ or the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties shall consult with one another prior to issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the comments of the other Parties on, any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such public announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Law or by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq or the NYSE, as applicable; _provided_ that each of the Company and Parent may make any public statements in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or analyst or investor calls, so long as such statements are not inconsistent with previous statements made jointly by the Company and Parent (or made by one party after having consulted with the other party). Without limiting _Section 5.4_, the Company shall not be required to provide any review or comment to Parent regarding any statement, release or disclosure in response to or in connection with the receipt and existence of a Company Takeover Proposal, its consideration of making or its making of Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any matters related thereto. The Company and Parent agree to issue the previously agreed upon form of joint press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement promptly following the execution of this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 5.10 _ _ _Indemnification and Insurance_.  

  

 (a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and related advancement of expenses now existing in favor of any present and former director, officer, employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, together with their respective heirs, executors and administrators, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof and set forth on Section 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Company Indemnified Parties, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations thereunder. The foregoing notwithstanding, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Company Indemnified Party with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities and advancement of expenses referenced in the preceding sentence shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each Company Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or Liabilities 

        

incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other fiduciary in any entity,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or
for the benefit of the Company and pertaining to matters existing or
occurring or actions or omissions taken prior to or at the Effective Time,
including with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses to the
Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by a final and nonappealable judicial determination that
such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this 
_Section 5.10_ or otherwise.

  

 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events, or actions or omissions, which occurred or are alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premium paid for the year ending December 31, 2017 by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation\'s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent or the Company (following prior consultation with Parent) may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence; _provided_ that if the total cost for such prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation may obtain a prepaid "tail" policy with the maximum coverage available for a total cost of the Premium Cap. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect for such six-year period, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 

  

 (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_. 

  

 (e) The rights of each Company Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Company Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or under applicable Law. The provisions of this  _Section 5.10_ shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this _Section 5.10_, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by the Company Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this  _Section 5.10_ as such fees are incurred upon the written request of such Company Indemnified Party. 

        

 (f) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of its respective obligations under this  _Section 5.10_. 

  

    
 Section 5.11 _ _ _Control of Operations_.  Without in any way limiting any Party\'s rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other Party\'s operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or replacement thereof). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (i) upon becoming aware of any material breach or default by any party to the Commitment Letter (or any replacement thereof) or definitive agreements related to the Financing and (ii) of the receipt of any notice or other communication from any Person party to any definitive document relating to the Financing (or any replacement thereof) or the Commitment Letter (or any replacement thereof) with respect to any material breach of Parent or any of its Affiliates of its obligations under any such document or letter or default, termination or repudiation by any party to any such document or letter. Unless the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or any replacement thereof) becomes unavailable in whole or in part, Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company agree to amend, modify, supplement, restate, substitute or replace the Commitment Letter (or any replacement thereof) if such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, substitution or replacement (a) materially expands the conditions precedent to the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date hereof (or in such replacement, as applicable) or (b) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to provide all cooperation that is necessary, customary or advisable and requested by Parent to assist Parent and Merger Sub in arranging, obtaining and syndicating any of the Financing including, without limitation, by (i) making senior management and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries available to participate at reasonable times in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions that are requested a reasonable time period in advance with proposed lenders, underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, and in sessions with rating agencies, (ii) providing reasonable and timely

management or advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries are requested by
Parent or Merger Sub to be present.

  

 (c) The provisions of _Section 5.13(b)_ notwithstanding, nothing in the foregoing _Section 5.13(b)_ will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to (i) agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent, (ii) take any action or provide any assistance that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) take any action or provide any information that will conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable material Laws or (in the case of the disclosure of information) would result in the waiver of any legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information to the maximum extent permitted by Law or to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of such legal privilege, as applicable, and in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not provide access or information in reliance on this clause, the Company shall provide notice to Parent that information is being withheld), (iv) give indemnities that are effective prior to the Effective Time for which it is not simultaneously indemnified by Parent, (v) pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing or any definitive agreements with respect thereto prior to the Effective Time, provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives shall cooperate with Parent to replace any officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries who will not be employed thereby immediately after Closing with Persons designated by Parent and to add any officers and directors designated by Parent, such replacements and additions to become effective immediately at Closing, (vi) cause the execution of any certificates or other documents (other than customary authorization and representation letters) by any employee

prior to or upon Closing, or (vii) take any action pursuant to this _Section
5.13_ or any other provision of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to result in personal liability to a director, officer or other
personnel. In addition, no action, liability or obligation of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to
any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument (other than
customary authorization and representation letters) relating to the Financing
will be required to be effective until the Effective Time.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, all non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives to Parent pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent will be permitted to disclose such information to any Financing Parties or prospective Financing Parties (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such information is furnished by Parent subject to customary confidentiality undertakings in connection with the Financing. 

  

 (e) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees, but excluding the costs of the Company\'s preparation of its annual and quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the Financing and the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives contemplated by _Section 5.13(a)_, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, any cooperation pursuant to _Section 5.13(a)_ and any information used in connection therewith, except with respect to (i) any information provided in writing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for use in connection with the Financing or (ii) any fraud, intentional misrepresentation, gross negligence or willful misconduct by any such persons or material breach by any such persons of their obligations hereunder.

If any litigation or claim meets the definition of both Company Transaction Litigation and Parent Transaction Litigation, it shall be treated as Parent Transaction Litigation, unless such litigation or claim against Parent and/or its directors or officers is only with respect to aiding and abetting or similar theories, in which case such litigation or claim shall be treated as Company Transaction Litigation.

_TERMINATION_

  

    Section 7.1 _ _ _Termination or Abandonment_.  Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time (except as otherwise provided below, whether before or after receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval), as follows:

  

 (a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; 

  

 (b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to February 14, 2019 (the " _End Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement was the principal cause of the Effective Time not occurring prior to the End Date, and _provided_ , _further_ , that if on the End Date all of the conditions to Closing, other than the condition set forth in  _Section 6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.1(d)_ as it relates to an Antitrust Law, shall have been satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, which conditions shall be capable of being satisfied at such time), the End Date may be extended by either Party to May 14, 2019 by written notice to the other Party; 

  

 (c) by either the Company or Parent, if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have entered or issued a final and nonappealable Order that remains in effect, or shall have adopted or enacted a Law that remains in effect, in either case, that permanently restrains, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to a Party if such Order (or such Order becoming final and nonappealable) was due to the material breach by such Party of any covenant or other agreement of such Party set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 (d) by either the Company or Parent, if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained upon a vote held at the Company Special Meeting as it may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with this Agreement; 

  

 (e) by the Company ( _provided_ that the Company is not then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) if (i) Parent or Merger Sub has materially breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the conditions in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ not being satisfied and (ii) which breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy is either not curable or is not cured by the earlier of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is thirty (30) Business Days following written notice from the Company to Parent describing such breach or failure to perform in reasonable detail; 

   

 (f) by Parent ( _provided_ that Parent is not then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement), if the Company has materially breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the conditions in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ not being 

         

satisfied and which breach or failure to perform is either not curable or is
not cured by the earlier of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is thirty
(30) Business Days following written notice from Parent to the Company
describing such breach or failure to perform in reasonable detail; or

  

 (g) by Parent, prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, (i) at any time following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) in the event of a Willful Breach by the Company of any of the material covenants or agreements contained in _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.7_, which breach is either not curable or is not cured by the earlier of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is thirty (30) Business Days following written notice from Parent to the Company describing such breach in reasonable detail. 

  

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1_
shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties in
accordance with  _Section 8.7_, specifying the provision of this Agreement
pursuant to which such termination is effected.

  

    
 Section 7.2 _ _ _Effect of Termination_.  In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no effect without Liability on the part of any Party hereto, and all rights and obligations of any Party hereto shall cease, except (i) as provided in _Section 7.3_ or (ii) Liability arising out of or resulting from fraud or any Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination (in which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity); _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this _Section 7.2_,  _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

   

    
 Section 7.3 _ _ _Termination Fees_.  

  

 (a) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(d)_ or  _Section 7.1(f)_ (for a Willful Breach only), (ii) a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or publicly disclosed after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination shall not have been publicly withdrawn and (iii) at any time on or prior to the twelve (12)-month anniversary of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, the Company Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (ii) above (a " _Company Takeover Transaction_ "), the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds, upon the earlier of entering into such definitive agreement with respect to the Company Takeover Transaction or the consummation of the Company Takeover Transaction; _provided_ that for the purposes of clause (iii) only, all references in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal to "twenty-five percent (25%)" shall instead be references to "fifty percent (50%)." 

  

 (b) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds, within three (3) Business Days after such termination. 

  

 (c) " _Termination Fee_ " shall be $38,765,000, in cash. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, if the Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section 7.3_, from and after such termination and payment of the Termination Fee in full pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3_, the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives (in the case of a payment of the Termination Fee by the Company) shall have no further Liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under this _Section 7.3_, except in the case of fraud. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is due and payable and do not involve fraud, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with 

        

precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled to more than one payment of
the Termination Fee in connection with a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to which such Termination Fee is payable. For the avoidance of
doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with _Section 8.5_ and the payment of the Company
Termination Fee under this _Section 7.3_, under no circumstances shall Parent
and Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive the Termination Fee
(if entitled under this _Section 7.3_) if the Merger is consummated.

  

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to this  _Section 7.3_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus two percent (2%). 

  

    
ARTICLE VIII 

  

_MISCELLANEOUS_

   

    Section 8.1 _ _ _No Survival_.  None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger,

Effective Time or otherwise expressly by their terms survive the Effective
Time.

  

    
 Section 8.2 _ _ _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

In the event any Party seeks any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.5_, such Party shall not be required to prove damages or obtain, furnish, provide or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section 8.5_ and each Party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, providing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. In addition, each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Merger in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in accordance with  _Section 8.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.
