extent not exercised as of the Company Merger Effective Time, together with the
2000 Stock Option Plan, shall terminate and be of no force and effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of the Company Merger Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option granted to each member of the board of directors of the

percent (100%) of the shares subject to each Director Stock Option.

                  (e) Stock Option Notice. As soon as practicable (but in no
event later than five (5) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent will,

Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to
the 1999 Stock Option Plan and that the agreements evidencing the grants of such
options will continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Article II after giving effect to the Mergers).

                  (f) Reclassifications, Stock Splits, etc. Without duplication
of any required adjustments under applicable law, if after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital
stock of any party, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the
Common Stock Exchange Ratio, Per Share Cash Consideration, Option Exchange Ratio
and any other amounts payable to holders of shares of capital stock of HoldCo or
the Company pursuant to this Agreement will be appropriately adjusted to provide
such holders the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to

to which holders of Certificates may be entitled. BNP Paribas, from time to time
and to the extent required, shall deposit with The Bank of New York, as exchange
agent ("The Bank of New York"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates
that elect to receive Parent ADSs, Parent Ordinary Shares, the underlying cash
in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs pursuant
to Section 2.6(b) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of
Certificates electing to receive Parent ADSs are entitled to receive pursuant to
this Article II in exchange for Certificates (Parent Shares and cash provided to
BNP Paribas, whether held by the BNP Paribas or The Bank of New York, the
"Exchange Fund").

                  (b) Exchange Procedures. Except as set forth in Section 2.6,
promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause BNP
Paribas to deliver to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
that, immediately prior to the Closing, represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or HoldCo Common Stock (as the case may be, the
"Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal that will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the BNP Paribas and which will be in the
form and have such other provisions as Parent and BNP Paribas may reasonably
specify and which letter of transmittal will include a form of election by which
each such holder is entitled to elect to receive Parent Ordinary Shares rather
than all or any portion of the Parent ADSs which such holder is entitled to
receive upon surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.5 and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for a number of whole Parent Shares, amount of Per Share Cash
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares pursuant to the terms
hereof and dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.6(c), if any, into
which the number of shares of Company Common Stock or HoldCo Common Stock, as
the case may be, previously represented by such Certificate will have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to BNP Paribas, together with a letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may be reasonably required by BNP Paribas, the holder of
such Certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the number of
whole Parent Shares for each share of Company Common Stock or HoldCo capital
stock, as the case may be, formerly represented by such Certificate (after
taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which the
holder is entitled pursuant to the terms hereof, which will be delivered in
uncertificated form, the amount of Per Share Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of
fraction of Parent Shares which the holder has the right to receive and any
dividends or distributions payable, and the Certificate so surrendered will be
cancelled. BNP Paribas will accept such Certificates upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as BNP Paribas may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No


                                                                            -13-
<PAGE>

interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates
on the Per Share Cash Consideration or cash payable pursuant to Section 2.6(b)
and (c) below upon the surrender of the Certificates.

                  (c) HoldCo Preferred Stock Exchange Procedures. Promptly after
the Effective Time, BNP Paribas will cause to be delivered to the holder of all
outstanding shares of HoldCo Preferred Stock, as reflected in the books and
records of the Company at the HoldCo Merger Effective Time, the number of Parent
ADSs determined pursuant to Section 2.1(b).

            Section 2.6 Parent Shares.

                  (a) The Parent Shares to be issued in exchange for the shares
of HoldCo Common Stock and Company Stock pursuant to this Article II will be (i)
registered in the name of The Bank of New York and delivered in the form of
Parent ADSs, and such Parent ADSs will be issued in accordance with the Amended
and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as of May 8, 1996, as amended and restated
as of December 30, 1998, among Parent, The Bank of New York, as depositary, and
the holders of Parent ADSs (as such agreement may be amended to deposit Parent
Ordinary Shares being issued pursuant to this Article II and to deliver Parent
ADSs being delivered hereto) or (ii) if and to the extent elected by any holder
of a Certificate in the manner provided in Section 2.5(b), registered in the
name of BNP Paribas and delivered in the form of Parent Ordinary Shares, in
book-entry form, rather than Parent ADSs.

                  (b) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no fraction of a Parent Share will be issued and no dividend or
other distribution, stock split or interest with respect to Parent Shares will
relate to any fractional Parent Share, and no such fractional interest will
entitle the owner thereof to any rights as a holder of a Parent Share. In lieu
of any such fractional security, each holder of shares of HoldCo capital stock
and Company Stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of Parent Share will be
entitled to receive in accordance with the provisions of this Section from BNP
Paribas or The Bank of New York, as the case may be (as appropriate, referred to
herein as the "Exchange Agent") a cash payment representing such holder's
proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent
on behalf of all such holders of the aggregate of the fractions of Parent Shares
which would otherwise be issued (the "Excess Parent Shares"). The sale of the
Excess Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent will be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the former holders of shares of HoldCo capital stock and Company
Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of
shares of HoldCo capital stock and Company Stock. Parent will pay all
commissions, transfer Taxes (other than those transfer Taxes for which the
stockholders of HoldCo and the Common are solely liable) and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation, of the Exchange
Agent incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Parent Shares. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of shares of HoldCo capital stock and Company Stock in lieu of any
fractional Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent will make available such amounts to
such holders of shares of HoldCo capital stock and Company Stock without
interest.



                                                                            -14-
<PAGE>

                  (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged HoldCo Capital
Stock and Company Stock. No dividends, interest payments or other distributions
declared or paid after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to any former holder of shares
of HoldCo capital stock and Company Stock with respect to Parent Shares
represented thereby until the amounts contemplated by Article II have been
delivered to such holder by the Exchange Agent. Subject to escheat, Tax or other
applicable law following such delivery, the Exchange Agent will deliver to the
holders of Parent Shares, without interest (i) at the time of such delivery, the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable in respect of such Parent
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or
prior to the date of such delivery and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends, interest payments or other distributions, with a record
date after the Effective Time but a payment date occurring after delivery,
payable with respect to such Parent Shares.

                  (d) Transfers of Ownership. If amounts contemplated by Article
II to be paid such that Parent Shares are to be issued to, or cash is to be
remitted to, a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it will be a condition of such exchange that the
Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of
Parent Shares or payment of cash to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

                  (e) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights In HoldCo
Common Stock. At the HoldCo Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
HoldCo will be closed and thereafter there will be no further registration of
transfers of shares of HoldCo capital stock on the records of HoldCo. From and
after the HoldCo Merger Effective Time, the former holders of shares of HoldCo
capital stock will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except
as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the HoldCo
Merger Effective Time, Certificates in respect of HoldCo capital stock are
presented for any reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.

                  (f) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights In Company
Stock. At the Company Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company will be closed and thereafter there will be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock on the records of the Company. From and
after the Company Merger Effective Time, the former holders of shares of Company
Stock will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Company Merger
Effective Time, Certificates in respect of Company Common Stock are presented to
for any reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

                  (g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months
after the Effective Time will, at the request of Parent, be delivered to Parent
to be held in


                                                                            -15-
<PAGE>

trust for such holders. Such holders of Certificates will be entitled thereafter
only to look to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat, statute of
limitations or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Common Stock Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares and any dividends or distributions payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock or HoldCo capital stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts otherwise would escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section, neither BNP Paribas, The Bank of New York, Parent
nor any party hereto will be liable to a holder of share of Company Common Stock
or HoldCo capital stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

                  (h) Required Withholding. Each of BNP Paribas, The Bank of New
York, Parent and the surviving corporation of any of the Mergers will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company
Stock or HoldCo capital stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law or under any other applicable law. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration will be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

                  (i) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Company Merger or consented thereto in writing and
who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into the right to
receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's rights to appraisal or it is
determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with
applicable law. If, after the Company Merger Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal, or if it is
determined that such holder does not have an appraisal right, such shares of
Company Common Stock will be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Company Merger Effective Time into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger
Consideration. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and
Parent will have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands except as required by applicable law. The Company
will not, except with prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the
extent required to do so under applicable law. The Exchange Agent will withhold
the Common Stock Merger Consideration with respect to each Dissenting Share and,
upon Parent's request, will promptly return to Parent the Common Stock Merger


                                                                            -16-
<PAGE>

Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section
2.5(a) to pay for shares for which appraisal rights are perfected.

                  (j) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue
and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Common Stock
Merger Consideration, cash for fractional shares, if any, and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant in each case, pursuant hereto; provided, however,
that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

                                   ARTICLE III

                     COMPANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            The Company represents and warrants to Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger

nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or license
necessary, except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, where such
failure to have such power or authority or to be so qualified or licensed would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section
3.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each jurisdiction where the
Company or any Company Subsidiary so qualified, licensed or admitted to do

consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations which if not
obtained or made individually or in the aggregate would not be material to the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or materially adversely affect the
ability of the parties hereto to consummate the Company Merger within the time
frame in which the Company Merger would otherwise be consummated in the absence
of the need for such consent, approval, order, authorization, registration,
declaration or filings. The consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings set forth in (i) through (iv) are
referred to herein as the "Company Necessary Consents."

            Section 3.4 Company SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

                  (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and documents
required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since June 30, 2000 and has
made available to Parent or its counsel such forms, reports and documents in the
form filed with the SEC (including the Company's registration statement on Form
S-1 filed on May 23, 2003, as amended (the "Company Form S-l")), and as those
documents have been amended and including such documents that the Company may
file subsequent to the date hereof (the "Company SEC Filings"). As of their
respective dates, the Company SEC Filings (i) were prepared and timely filed in
accordance with and complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and
(ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superceded by a
filing prior to the date hereof, then on the date of such filing) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of
the Company's Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC.

                  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including,
in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Filings
(including such financial statements as were incorporated by reference) (the
"Company Financial Statements") (i) complied in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form
10-Q, Form 8-K or any similar or successor form under the Exchange Act), and
(iii) fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated therein, except that the unaudited interim financial
statements may not contain footnotes and were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments. The reserves reflected in the Company Financial
Statements have been calculated in accordance with GAAP. The balance sheet of

or one of the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be.

                  (l) To the Company's Knowledge, (i) the consummation of the
Company Merger will not result in Parent being bound by any non-compete or other

Material Adverse Effect. No claims have been asserted in writing against the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by any Person or entity alleging a
violation of such Person's or entity's privacy, personal or confidentiality

required.

                  (o) No issue relating to Taxes has been raised by any Tax
Authority in any Audit, that by application of the same or similar principals,
reasonably could be expected to result in a proposed deficiency for the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any period not so examined. Further, to
the knowledge of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, no state of facts

material Tax liability for the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with

liabilities that are adequately reflected on the Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP.

                  (p) To the knowledge of the Company and the Company

agreements, arrangements or understandings between the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, and any current or former officer or director of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary. The Company does not have any commitment to establish
any new Benefit Plan, to modify any Benefit Plan (except to the extent required
by law or to conform any such Benefit Plan to the requirements of any applicable

                  (b) Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists

for the benefit of any current or former employees, officers, consultants or

limitation, applicable federal and state securities laws.

                  (c) All Pension Plans have been the subject of determination,
notification, advisory and/or opinion letters from the Internal Revenue Service
to the effect that such Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from federal
income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code or have
remaining a period of time under applicable Treasury regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter and make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to the qualified status of each
such Company Benefit Plan, a true, complete and correct copy of each such
determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion letter has been provided to
Parent, and no such determination notification, advisory and/or opinion letter
has been revoked nor has any event occurred since the date of the most recent
determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion letter or application
therefor for each Pension Plan that would adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its costs.

                  (d) Neither the Company, nor any Company Subsidiary, nor any
Commonly Controlled Entity has at any time maintained, contributed or been
obligated to contribute to any Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA, including any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA).

                  (e) No current or former employee, officer, or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary will be entitled to any additional
compensation or benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or
exercisability or any other enhancement of any compensation or benefits under
any Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (f) The deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms
of the Benefit Plans will not be subject to disallowance under Section 280G or
162(m) of the Code.

                  (g) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) by any employee, consultant, officer or
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be an Excess Parachute
Payment. No such person is entitled to receive any Parachute Gross-Up Payment
and the Company's board of directors has not granted to any officer, director,
consultant or employee of the Company any right to receive any Parachute
Gross-Up Payment.

                  (h) No Benefit Plan provides benefits, including without

(other than routine claims for benefits).

                  (j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor any
Commonly Controlled Entity, nor any of the Benefit Plans, nor any trust created
thereunder nor any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction
or has taken or failed to take any action in connection with which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) or ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section
4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code.

                  (k) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to the

agreement with any labor organization applicable to the employees of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary and no such agreement is currently being negotiated.

Parent or any of Parent Subsidiaries pursuant to any Parent Material Contract
other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, rights, terminations, amendments, accelerations,
cancellations or Encumbrances that individually or in the aggregate would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially adversely affect
the ability of Parent to consummate the Mergers within the time frame in which

violation, breach, default, right, termination, amendment, acceleration,
cancellation or Encumbrance.

authorization, registration, declaration or filings. The consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings set forth in (i)

to be filed by Parent with the SEC since January 1, 2000 and has made available
to the Company or its counsel such forms, reports and documents in the form
filed with the SEC (as those documents have been amended and including those

As of their respective dates, Parent SEC Filings (i) were prepared and timely
filed in accordance with and complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and (ii) did not at the time
they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
hereof, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact or disclose any matter or
proceeding required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were

forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

                  (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including,
in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Filings,
(i) complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any similar
or successor form under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated therein, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements may not contain footnotes and were or are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments. The reserves reflected in
the Parent Financial Statements are adequate, appropriate and reasonable and
have been calculated in a consistent manner in accordance with GAAP. The balance
sheet of Parent contained in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
period ended March 31, 2003 is hereinafter referred to as the "Parent Balance
Sheet."

                  (c) Parent has made available to the Company or its counsel
(i) a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications to the Parent
SEC Filings, which have not yet been filed with the SEC but that Parent intends
to file as of the date hereof, (ii) complete and correct copies of any
correspondence with, and inquiries from, the SEC with respect to previously

correspondence generated in connection with the submission of filings under
Section 16 of the Exchange Act and requests for and responses to requests for
Edgar identification codes, and (iii) complete and correct copies of any
correspondence with, and inquiries from, Nasdaq or the French Stock Exchange
Authorities which in and of themselves constitute information currently material
to Parent's business.

                  (d) Parent has implemented "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act)
designed


                                                                            -44-

is made known to Parent's chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
Each required form, report and document containing financial statements that has
been filed with or submitted to the SEC since July 31, 2002, was accompanied by
the certifications required to be filed or submitted by Parent's chief executive
officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and at
the time of filing or submission of each such certification, such certification
was true, accurate and complete, and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (e) Since June 30, 2000, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary nor, to Parent's Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or Representative of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any written complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices. No attorney representing Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, whether or not employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, has
reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or
similar violation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to Parent's board of directors or any committee thereof or to any
director or officer of Parent.

business in all material respects only in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices and in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable laws and regulations and, specifically and without limitation of
the foregoing, there has not been, with respect to Parent:

other partnership interests or any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire
any such shares or other securities except for repurchases from employees or
consultants following their termination pursuant to the terms of their
pre-existing stock option or purchase agreements, or (iii) any amendment of any
material term of any outstanding security.

liabilities incurred since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices.

have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) In the one (1) year period preceding the date hereof,

            Section 5.15 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Parent has received the
written opinion of Thomas Weisel to the effect that the consideration to be paid
by Parent to the holders of HoldCo Common Stock, Company Common Stock and
options to acquire Company Common Stock, in the aggregate, pursuant to the
Merger, is fair to Parent from a financial point of view as of the date of such
opinion and a true and complete copy of such opinion will be delivered to
Company when available.

                        (i) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its
      Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
      existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any Persons
      with respect to any offer or proposal for a merger, consolidation or other
      business combination involving the Company, any acquisition of a
      substantial amount of the capital stock (or securities convertible into,
      or exchangeable or exercisable for, capital stock) or assets of the
      Company, any recapitalization with respect to the Company or any other
      transaction similar to any of the foregoing with respect to the Company

      will not authorize its employees to continue any existing discussions,
      negotiations or communications with any Persons with respect to any
      Company Acquisition Proposal.


                                                                            -53-

                        (ii) Except as provided in Section 6.2(c), the Company
      will not, and will not authorize or permit its Representatives or
      authorize its employees to, directly or indirectly (A) initiate, solicit,
      knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to,
      or the making of any offer or proposal which constitutes, or is reasonably
      likely to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or
      participate in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any
      information or data to, any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub 1,
      Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3 or any of their respective affiliates or
      Representatives) relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal, except as
      to the existence of these provisions, (C) make or authorize any statement,
      recommendation or solicitation in support of, or approve, any Company
      Acquisition Proposal, (D) enter into any letter of intent or similar
      document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or
      otherwise relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal or transaction

                        (iii) Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any
      of the Company's Representatives will be deemed to be a breach of this
      Agreement by the Company, whether or not such Representative is so
      authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on
      behalf of the Company.

                  (b) Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals. The
Company will promptly notify Parent orally and in writing if any proposals are
received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or
discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with the Company or any of
its Representatives, in each case in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal or a written indication that a Company Acquisition Proposal is under
consideration indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of the Person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions
thereof. The Company agrees that it will keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and material terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal. The
Company will provide Parent with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such
lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Company's board of
directors) of any meeting of the Company's board of directors at which its board
of directors is reasonably expected to discuss or consider any Company
Acquisition Proposal.

                  (c) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until
such time as the Company Merger is approved by the Company's stockholders in
accordance with applicable law, the Company may furnish information concerning
its business, properties or assets to any Person pursuant to an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms (i) no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) which will not include
any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party and
which (iii) will not have the effect of


                                                                            -54-
<PAGE>
prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement,
and may participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning
any Company Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, (y) such Person has on an
unsolicited basis, and in the absence of any willful or knowing violation of
this Section 6.2 by the Company or any of its Representatives, submitted a bona
fide written Company Acquisition Proposal to the Company, and (z) in the good
faith judgment of the Company's board of directors, upon the advice of outside
legal counsel to the Company, the failure to provide such information or access
or to engage in such discussions or negotiations would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company
will promptly provide to Parent any material non-public information regarding
the Company provided to any other party which was not previously provided to
Parent, such additional information to be provided no later than the date of
provision of such information to such other party.

                  (d) Compliance with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or any other provision hereof
will prohibit the Company or the Company's board of directors from taking and
disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9
or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable law; provided, however, that neither the
taking or disclosing to the Company's stockholders of a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 nor compliance with the Company's disclosure obligations
under applicable law shall relieve the Company or the Company's board of
directors of their respective obligations and restrictions under this Agreement
(including those articulated in this Section 6.2), or limit, restrict or
otherwise impair the rights of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub
3 under this Agreement.

      not being satisfied, or that would impair the ability of Parent to
      consummate the Mergers in accordance with the terms hereof or materially
      delay such consummation; or

                        (v) enter into any written or oral agreement, contract,
      commitment or arrangement to take any of the actions described in (i)
      through (iv) above.

            Section 7.2 Acquisition Proposals.

                  (a) No Solicitation.


                                                                            -56-

                        (i) Parent agrees that it will, and will cause its
      Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
      existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any Persons
      with respect to any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
      combination resulting in a change of control of Parent or sale of all or
      substantially all of the Parent Shares or Parent's assets that would be
      reasonably likely to (A) materially adversely affect the ability of Parent
      to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
      material delay or (B) require a vote of Parent's stockholders prior to the
      Parent Stockholders' Meeting (a "Parent Acquisition Proposal"). In
      addition, Parent agrees that it will not authorize its employees to
      continue any existing discussions, negotiations or communications with any
      Persons with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal.

                        (ii) Except as provided in Section 7.2(c), Parent will
      not, and will not authorize or permit its Representatives or authorizes
      its employees to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or
      knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to,
      the making of any offer or proposal which constitutes, or is reasonably
      likely to lead to, any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or
      participate in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any
      information or data to, any Person relating to any Parent Acquisition
      Proposal, except as to the existence of these provisions, (C) make or
      authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of, or
      approve, any Parent Acquisition Proposal, or (D) enter into any letter of
      intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment
      contemplating or otherwise relating to any Parent Acquisition Proposal or
      transaction contemplated thereby.

                        (iii) Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any
      of Parent's Representatives will be deemed to be a breach of this
      Agreement by Parent, whether or not such Representative is so authorized
      and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of
      Parent.

                  (b) Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals. Parent
will promptly notify the Company orally and in writing if any offer or proposal
is received by, Parent or any of its Representatives which constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent will provide
the Company with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior
notice as is provided to the members of Parent's board of directors) of (i) any
meeting of Parent's board of directors at which its board of directors is
reasonably expected to discuss or consider any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
the taking of any actions referred to in Sections 7.2(a)(ii)(C) or (D), or (iii)
the amendment, modification, withdrawal, condition or qualification of the
recommendation of the board of directors of Parent or any committee thereof.

                  (c) Certain Parent Acquisition Proposals.


                                                                            -57-
<PAGE>
                        (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
      7.2(a), Parent may furnish information concerning its business, properties
      or assets to any Person pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement
      with terms no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the
      Confidentiality Agreement, and may take any of the actions referred to in
      Sections 7.2(a)(ii) (B) through (D) above concerning a Parent Acquisition
      Proposal if, but only if, (A) such Person has on an unsolicited basis,
      submitted a bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal to Parent, and
      (B) in the good faith judgment of Parent's board of directors, based on
      the advice of independent outside legal counsel, the failure to take any
      such action would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
      fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, however, that the taking
      of any such action will not and shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of this Agreement.

                        (ii) Nothing in this Section 7.2 will prevent Parent
      from responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry or engaging in
      negotiations or discussions or entering into any agreement with respect to
      any transaction that is not a Parent Acquisition Proposal; provided, that
      any agreement relating to such transaction will not and shall not affect
      the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.

                  (d) Compliance with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 7.2 or any other provision hereof
will prohibit Parent or Parent's board of directors from taking and disclosing
to Parent's stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act or any similar situation provided for under
similar applicable French law and regulations; provided, however, that the
taking or disclosing to Parent's stockholders of a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 or any similar applicable French law and regulations shall
not relieve Parent or Parent's board of directors of their respective
obligations and restrictions under this Agreement (including those articulated
in this Section 7.2), or limit, restrict or otherwise impair the rights of the
Company under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

                  (a) Promptly following the domestication of HoldCo as
contemplated by Section 8.30, HoldCo will submit to the HoldCo Stockholder for
its approval and adoption (as appropriate) this Agreement, the HoldCo Merger and

following the execution of this Agreement by the parties, the Company will
submit to HoldCo for its approval and adoption (as appropriate) this Agreement,
the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company
Proposals"). The Company will use its best efforts to obtain the approval and
adoption (as appropriate) of the HoldCo


                                                                            -58-
<PAGE>
Proposal and the Company Proposals by the HoldCo Stockholder and HoldCo,
respectively, in accordance with this Section 8.1(a).

                  (b) As promptly as practicable following the approval and
adoption of the Company Proposals by HoldCo, the Company will, in accordance
with the applicable law, notify each Company stockholder that the Company
Proposals have been approved and adopted by HoldCo and that appraisal rights are
available under the DGCL, including by filing with the SEC the Company
Information Statement in accordance with the Exchange Act. Parent will furnish
all information concerning itself as the Company may reasonably request in
connection with such actions and the preparation of any such notice and the
Company Information Statement. Parent and its counsel will be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Company Information Statement (and any
amendment or supplement thereto) prior to its being filed with the SEC.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company will notify its stockholders with respect to the approval and adoption
of the Company Proposals in accordance with applicable law.

                  (d) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement,
Parent in its capacity as the sole stockholder of each of Merger Sub 1, Merger
Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3 shall approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the
Mergers.

            Section 8.2 Approval by Parent.

Mergers, (ii) approval of the issuance of Parent Shares pursuant to the Capital
Increase, (iii) the appointment of two additional members to Parent's board of
directors as contemplated by Section 8.8, and (iv) such other matters as Parent
reasonably believes are necessary to be approved under applicable law to
consummate the Mergers in accordance with the terms hereof (collectively, the
"Parent Proposals"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(y) Parent shall be permitted to adjourn the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, from
time to time, until such time as all other conditions set forth in Article IX
(other than conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing) have
been satisfied or duly waived and (z) unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, Parent will call, hold and convene the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting for the purpose of considering the approval of the Parent
Proposals.

                  (b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2(b), Parent's
board of directors will recommend that Parent's stockholders vote in favor of
the Parent Proposals. Neither Parent's board of directors nor any committee
thereof will amend modify, withdraw, condition or qualify the recommendation in
a manner adverse to the Company unless Parent's board of directors determines in
good faith, based on the advice of independent outside legal counsel, that the
failure to so amend, modify or withdraw,


                                                                            -59-

condition or qualify the recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in
a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

            Section 8.3 Parent Proxy Statement; Registration Statement.

                  (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, Parent will prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-4 (together with all amendments thereto, the "Registration Statement")
for the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Shares to be issued
pursuant to the Mergers. The Company will furnish all information concerning
itself as Parent may reasonably request in connection with such actions and the
preparation of the Registration Statement. Parent will use all reasonable
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as
practicable and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and its counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Registration Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto)
prior to it being filed with the SEC.

                  (b) Prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement,
Parent will take all or any action required under any applicable U.S. federal or
state and non-U.S. securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent

                  (c) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (i) Parent will seek the appointment of commissiares aux apports in
connection with the Mergers, (ii) Parent will prepare, publish and/or make
available, to the extent required, and in accordance with the applicable French
law and regulations, to Parent's stockholders the resolutions related to the
Parent Proposals, the rapport du conseil d'administration a l'assemblee and the
rapport des commissaires aux apports (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the "Parent Proxy Statement") relating to the Parent's
Stockholders' Meeting to be held to consider approval of the Parent Proposals,
and (iii) Parent will prepare and file with the French Stock Exchange
Authorities all filings required (the "Parent French Filings") in connection
with the Parent Stockholders' Meeting to be held to consider approval of the
Parent Proposals. The Company will promptly furnish all information concerning
the Company as Parent may reasonably request in connection with such actions and
the preparation of the Parent Proxy Statement and the Parent French Filings. The
Company and its counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Registration Statement, the Parent Proxy Statement and the other
Parent French Filings (and any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to them
being filed with the applicable agency.

                  (d) The Parent Proxy Statement will include the recommendation
of Parent's board of directors to Parent's stockholders in favor of the Parent
Proposals, subject to Section 8.2(b).

                  (e) Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of (i) the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective, (ii) the issuance of any stop order, (iii) the suspension of the
qualification of Parent


                                                                            -60-

additional information, (v) any request by the COB or other French regulatory

at which the COB grants its approval, as the case may be, on the relevant Parent
French Filings.

                  (f) The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the
Registration Statement will not, at (i) the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective, and (ii) the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Company Information Statement will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. If, at any time prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, any
event or circumstance relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or their
respective officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent which should be
set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement, the
Parent French Filings or the Company Information Statement, Parent will promptly
inform the Company. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the
SEC or the COB in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will comply as to form and substance in all
material aspects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and

Parent French Filings are filed with the COB will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be

discovered by the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statements or the Parent
French Filings, the Company will promptly inform Parent. All documents that the
Company is


                                                                            -61-

responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply as to form and substance
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.

            Section 8.4 Confidentiality.

                  (a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company
have previously executed a non-disclosure agreement dated June 17, 2003 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Parent agrees that its
obligations with respect to confidentiality thereunder will apply to HoldCo and
information concerning HoldCo to the same extent as the Company as though HoldCo
were a party thereto. In addition, the parties hereto agree that the terms and
conditions of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and information
exchanged in connection with the execution hereof and the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby will be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement. Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3 and HoldCo hereby agree that
each will be bound by the confidentiality terms thereof to the same extent as
Parent is bound by the terms thereof, as if each of them were a party thereto.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties (and each
employee, Representative, or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and
all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment and any facts
that may be relevant to the Tax structure of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that neither party (nor any
employee, Representative or other agent thereof) may disclose any information
that is not relevant to understanding the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the identity
of any party and any information that could lead another to determine the
identity of any party), or any information to the extent that such disclosure
could result in a violation of any federal or state securities law.

            Section 8.5 Public Disclosure. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement will be a joint press release
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Unless otherwise required by law
(including federal, state and foreign securities laws), or, as to Parent, by the
rules and regulations of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or
the rules and regulations of the French Stock Exchange Authorities, no statement
or other disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry) of the subject
matter of this Agreement, including the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, will be made by any party hereto unless approved by Parent
and the Company prior to release; provided, that such approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

            Section 8.6 Listing of Parent Shares.

                  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Parent ADSs to be issued in the Mergers pursuant
to the Capital Increase to be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National
Market (or such other stock exchange or trading system on which Parent ADSs are
then primarily trading).


                                                                            -62-
<PAGE>
                  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued in the
Mergers pursuant to the Capital Increase to be authorized for listing on
Euronext.

            Section 8.7 Form S-8. Parent will file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms that Parent is eligible to
use) under the Securities Act with respect to the Parent Shares subject to the
Company Stock Option Plan, to the extent Form S-8 registration is available for
such Parent Shares, as soon as practicable but, in any event, within five (5)
business days following the Effective Time and will maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement(s) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.

            Section 8.8 Board of Directors. Parent will take all necessary
action, subject to applicable law, to cause the number of members of Parent's
board of directors to be increased by two (2) as of the Effective Time, and to
use reasonable best efforts to cause the vacancies to be filled by (a) David J.
Roux (or such other Person as may be designated in writing by HoldCo Stockholder
at least forty-five (45) days prior to the filling of such vacancy; provided,
that such Person is reasonably acceptable to Parent) and (b) one (1) individual
who qualifies as an "independent" director of Parent pursuant to proposed and
applicable law and regulations (the "Independent Director"). Parent's board of
directors will in good faith propose and recommend for appointment one (1)
current "independent" director of the Company to fill the Independent Director
vacancy. The Company and its counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on Parent's board of directors resolution contemplated by
this Section 7.8.

            Section 8.9 Affiliates. Schedule 8.9 sets forth those Persons who
are "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under
the Securities Act (each such Person, an "Affiliate"). The Company will provide
Parent such information and documents as Parent will request for purposes of
reviewing such list. The Company has delivered, or will use all reasonable
efforts to cause to be delivered, to Parent from each of its respective
Affiliates, other than the HoldCo Stockholder and Affiliates of the HoldCo
Stockholder, an executed Affiliate Agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the parties. Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3
will be entitled to take all necessary steps to ensure that any Parent Shares
issued to such Affiliates are identified as restricted securities within the
meaning of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and that any resales of
such Parent Shares will be made in accordance with an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration
statement.

            Section 8.10 Access to Information. HoldCo and the Company will, and
will cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford Parent and its accountants,
counsel and other Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
to its properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to the
Company Merger Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business,
including the status of product development efforts, properties, results of
operations and personnel (subject to such reasonable procedures as the parties
may agree), as Parent may reasonably request, and, during such period, upon
request by Parent, the Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to
furnish promptly to Parent a copy of any report, schedule,


                                                                            -63-

registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and the Company
will reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect to transition of employees
following the Closing; provided, however, that the Company may restrict the
foregoing access to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity applicable to the Company requires such party to restrict or
prohibit access to any such properties or information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) no information retrieved from the Company's financial reporting
system will be made available to Persons who are directly involved in pricing or
any other competitive activity at Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (b) Parent
shall not use any information obtained from the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 8.10 for any
purposes other than assessing the financial condition of the Company for
purposes of this Agreement, and (c) Parent will not share, provide or sell the
information to any third party or use the information in any manner that could
reasonably be considered a restraint on competition or result in a violation of
any applicable law. In addition, any information obtained from the Company or
any Company Subsidiary pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 8.10
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

            Section 8.11 Notification.

                  (a) By the Company. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3 of any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate,
or any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.11(a) will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent or the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or the conditions to the
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3.

                  (b) By Parent. Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger

failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section
8.3(a) or 8.3(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 8.11(b) will not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the Company or the representations,
warranties or covenants of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3
or the conditions to the obligations of the Company.

            Section 8.12 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts.

                  (a) Regulatory Filings. Each of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger
Sub 2, Merger Sub 3 and the Company will coordinate and cooperate with one
another and will each use all reasonable efforts to comply with, and will each
refrain from taking any action that would impede compliance with, all Legal
Requirements, and as promptly


                                                                            -64-
<PAGE>
as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub
2, Merger Sub 3 and the Company will make all filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, application or submission
of other documents required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including (i)
Notification and Report Forms with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice ("DOJ") as required by the HSR Act, (ii) any other filing necessary to
obtain any Company Necessary Consent or Parent Necessary Consent (together, the
"Necessary Consents"), (iii) filings under any other comparable pre-merger
notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws of any
applicable jurisdiction, as agreed by the parties hereto, and (iv) any filings
required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable state or

Company will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any
Governmental Entity under this Section 8.12(a) to comply in all material
respects with all applicable Legal Requirements.

                  (b) Exchange of Information. Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub

preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other (and
its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a
summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with any Governmental

hereby; provided, that with respect to any such filing, presentation or
submission, each of Parent and the Company need not supply the other (or its
counsel) with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) to the extent
that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable

                  (d) Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the express provisions of
Section 8.12(e) and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist

advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner

Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, including all Necessary Consents (provided, that the

Closing hereunder), (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining

result in their dismissal, removal, elimination or termination, and (v) the
execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the
Company's board of directors will, if any takeover statute or similar Legal
Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Company Merger, this Agreement or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, use all reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Company Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Legal Requirement on the Company Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (e) Limitation on Divestiture and Litigation. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement
will be deemed to require Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates to (i) except to the
extent provided under Section 8.12(d)(iv), litigate or agree to litigate against
any Governmental Entity or (ii) take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture

separate of Company capital stock or imposing or seeking to impose any

(y) otherwise taking any step to avoid or eliminate any impediment which may be
asserted under any Legal Requirement governing competition, monopolies or
restrictive trade practices.

action necessary to render such statute inapplicable to all of the foregoing. If

applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, Parent will take all action necessary to render such statute or other
similar law inapplicable to all of the foregoing.

outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the exercise price at which such
Person acquired the Company Common Stock upon exercise of a Company Stock Option
plus applicable statutory interest; (ii) outstanding options to acquire Company
Common Stock at twenty percent (20%) of the amount equal to the exercise price
of the subject Company Stock Options multiplied by the total number of shares of

statutory interest. If applicable, the Company will make filings with the
California Department of Corporations, as well as any other state or other
agency with whom the Company is so required to file.

            Section 8.15 Resignations and Appointments. The Company shall use

            Section 8.16 Employee Benefits(a).

                  (a) Following the Effective Time, Parent will use all
reasonable efforts to give each Continuing Employee (as defined below) credit
for prior service with the Company and any Company Subsidiaries for purposes of
(i) eligibility and vesting under any applicable employee benefit plans of
Parent in which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate at or
following the Effective Time, provided that if the Company maintains a
comparable Benefit Plan, service shall be credited solely to the extent that
such service was or would have been credited for such purposes under such
comparable plan, and (ii) determination of benefits levels under any vacation
policy in which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate at or
following the Effective Time. Parent shall give credit under those applicable
employee benefit plans of Parent that are welfare benefit plans and in which
Continuing Employees become eligible to participate at or following the
Effective Time, for all co-payments made, amounts credited toward deductibles
and out-of-pocket maximums, and time accrued against applicable waiting periods,
by Continuing Employees (including their eligible dependents), in respect of the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs but if the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries maintains a comparable Benefit Plan, solely to the extent such
waiting period requirements and conditions were not applicable to the particular
Continuing Employee under such comparable Benefit Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Continuing Employees" shall mean those employees of Parent and
employees of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time who shall have
been employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  (b) If Parent maintains as of the Effective Date, a
tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan that accepts eligible rollover
distributions within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, the assets
of the Continuing Employees located in the US under the defined contribution
401(k) plan of the Company may be rolled over, to the extent permitted and in
the form acceptable, to the 401(k) plan of the Parent.

                  (c) Parent agrees that the Continuing Employees may
participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by Parent (the "Parent
ESPP"), commencing on the first date of the Offering Period (as defined in the
Parent ESPP) coincident or immediately following the Effective Date and subject
to the terms and conditions of the Parent ESPP, provided that no such
participation is required hereunder to the extent that there are inadequate
shares for such purpose under the Parent ESPP.

                  (d) Effective as of the Effective Time, for a period of one
year following the Closing Date, or if shorter, until such time as the
applicable Continuing Employee ceases to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to
Continuing Employees, (i) employee benefits that are substantially similar in
the aggregate to those benefits provided to such employees by the Company
immediately prior to the date hereof, or (ii) at Parent's election, employee
benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those benefits
provided by Parent (or its applicable Subsidiary) to similar situated employees
of Parent (or its applicable Subsidiary).


                                                                            -68-

                  (e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
together develop retention programs for Continuing Employees who are key
employees whom the Parent desires to continue employment. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Company will together develop severance plans for
Continuing Employees who cease employment within one year of the Closing Date
that are comparable to those of the Parent's standard practices.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
be interpreted as conferring, or intending to confer, on any Continuing Employee
or other Company employee a right to continued employment with the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent.

certain Indemnification Agreement, dated as of March 29, 2000, as amended, by
and among VERITAS, Suez Acquisition Company (Cayman) Limited and certain other
persons who executed a Joinder Agreement thereto, as contemplated by Section 17
(successors) thereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, or
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be
required to make payments, expand monies or otherwise agree to any economic
arrangements or concessions to satisfy its obligations under this Section 8.17.

required by Parent to comply with applicable SEC and COB regulations, (ii) the
reasonable review of any Company audit or review work papers for up to the past
three (3) years, including the examination of selected financial statements and
data, and (iii) the delivery of such representations from the Company's
independent accountants as may be reasonably requested by Parent of its
independent auditors in connection with the preparation of the Registration

Preferred Stock, (b) cause Option Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HoldCo, to
be formed as a limited liability company, (c) issue and contribute to the
capital of Option Sub such number of shares of HoldCo Preferred Stock as will,
upon the consummation of the HoldCo Merger and in accordance with Section 2.1(b)
hereof, result in Option Sub owning at least the maximum number of Parent Shares
that may be issuable upon exercise of all outstanding Company Stock Options in
accordance with the terms hereof, and (d) to the extent necessary or advisable,
take such reasonable action such that, upon exercise of any Company Stock Option
after the Effective Time, the Parent Shares to be issued to the holder of such
Company Stock Option will be delivered by Option Sub.

Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Shares) resulting

officer or director of the Company or Parent who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act (or who will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby) with respect to equity
securities of the Company or Parent.

            Section 8.23 Transaction Expenses. The fees and expenses paid or
payable by the Company in connection with the Company's previously proposed
initial public offering, this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including fees and expenses of the financial advisors,
legal counsel and public accountants listed on Schedule 8.23) will be reasonable
and customary for such transactions and, except as listed on Schedule 8.23,
shall not include any fees payable to the HoldCo Stockholder or any of its
stockholders, partners or Affiliates.

                  (b) Insurance. For a period of six (6) years after the

persons who are covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy as of the date hereof on terms comparable to those applicable
to the current directors and officers of the Company for a period of six (6)
years; provided, however, that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in excess of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, and to the extent
annual premium would exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the Surviving
Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained the
maximum amount of coverage as is available for such one hundred fifty percent
(150%) of such annual premium.

Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and

cause Parent to not be considered a corporation pursuant to Section 367(a) of

                  (e) HoldCo Officer's Certificate. HoldCo will have delivered

                        (i) Parent will have received a written opinion from
      Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, dated as of the date of the
      Second HoldCo Merger Effective Time, in form and substance reasonably
      satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax
      purposes, (i) the HoldCo Merger when taken together with the Second HoldCo
      Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of


                                                                            -74-

      Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized by
      a stockholder of HoldCo (other than a stockholder of HoldCo who owns,
      directly or indirectly and taking into account certain attribution rules

      Merger) on the conversion of its shares of HoldCo Common Stock into Parent
      Shares except to the extent of cash received, including cash received in
      lieu of a fractional share of Parent Shares, provided that HoldCo (or its
      successor) complies with the reporting requirements contained in Treasury
      Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6), and such opinion shall not have been
      withdrawn; provided, however, that if Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
      LLP shall not render such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be
      deemed satisfied if another law firm with a nationally recognized tax
      practice, as reasonably satisfactory to Parent (other than the law firm
      providing the opinion pursuant to Section 9.3(f) of the Agreement), shall
      render such opinion to Parent. In rendering such opinion, Skadden, Arps,
      Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP or such other law firm, as the case may be, may
      require and be entitled to rely on representations, covenants and rulings
      of Parent and HoldCo, including the HoldCo Merger Parent Tax Certificate
      and the HoldCo Tax Certificate.

      purposes (i) the Company Merger when taken together with the Second
      Company Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
      Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized by
      a stockholder of the Company (other than a stockholder of the Company who
      owns, directly or indirectly and taking into account certain attribution
      rules including the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-
      3(c)(4)(i), five percent (5%) or more of the total voting power or total
      value of Parent's outstanding capital stock immediately after the Second
      Company Merger) on the conversion of its shares of Company Common Stock
      into Parent Shares except to the extent of cash received, including cash
      received in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Shares, provided that the
      Company (or its successor) complies with the reporting requirements
      contained in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6), and such
      opinion shall not have been withdrawn; provided, however, that if Skadden,
      Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP shall not render such opinion, this
      condition shall nonetheless be deemed satisfied if another law firm with a
      nationally recognized tax practice, as reasonably satisfactory to Parent
      (other than the law firm providing the opinion pursuant to Section 9.3(f)
      of the Agreement), shall render such opinion to Parent. In rendering such
      opinion, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP or such other law firm,
      as the case may be, may require and be


                                                                            -75-

      the Company, including the Company Merger Parent Tax Certificate and the
      Company Tax Certificate.

                  (g) Governmental Restriction. There shall not be any pending
or overtly threatened suit, action or proceeding asserted by any Governmental
Entity (i) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of
the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby the effect of
which restraint or prohibition if obtained would cause the condition set forth
in Section 9.1(c) not to be satisfied, or (ii) seeking to require Parent, any
Parent Subsidiary, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to effect any Action of
Divestiture which would have the effect set forth in clause (ii) of the first
sentence of Section 8.12(e).

            Section 9.3 Additional Conditions to Obligation of HoldCo and the
Company to Effect the Mergers. The obligation of each of the Company and HoldCo
to effect the Mergers will be subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the
Company on or prior to the Closing Date of each of the following conditions, any
and all of which may be waived in whole or in part by the Company to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3 contained in
this Agreement will have been true and correct in all respects on the date
hereof and will be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date with
the same force and effect as if made on the Closing Date (except that those
representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular
date will have been true and correct only as of such date), with such exceptions
as do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that for purposes of
determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, any update of
or modification to the Parent Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been
made after the execution of this Agreement will be disregarded.

                  (b) Agreements and Covenants. Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub
2 and Merger Sub 3 will have performed or complied in all material respects with
all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by them at or prior to the Closing Date.

                  (c) Parent Material Adverse Effect. No Parent Material Adverse
Effect will have occurred since the date hereof and be continuing.

                  (f) Tax Opinions.

                        (i) HoldCo will have received a written opinion from
      Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a Professional Corporation, dated as of
      the date of the Second HoldCo Merger Effective Time, in form and substance
      reasonably satisfactory to HoldCo, to the effect that, for U.S. federal
      income tax purposes, (i) the HoldCo Merger when taken together with the
      Second HoldCo Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning
      of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized
      by a stockholder of HoldCo (other than a stockholder of HoldCo who owns,
      directly or indirectly and taking into account certain attribution rules,

      Parent's outstanding capital stock immediately after the Second HoldCo
      Merger) on the conversion of its shares of HoldCo Common Stock into Parent
      Shares except to the extent of cash received, including cash received in
      lieu of a fractional share of Parent Shares, provided that HoldCo (or its
      successor) complies with the reporting requirements contained in Treasury
      Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6), and such opinion shall not have been
      withdrawn; provided, however, that if Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati
      shall not render such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed
      satisfied if another law firm with a nationally recognized tax practice,
      as reasonably satisfactory to HoldCo (other than the law firm providing
      the opinion pursuant to Section 9.2(f) of the Agreement), shall render
      such opinion to HoldCo. In rendering such opinion, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich
      & Rosati or such other law firm, as the case may be, may require and be
      entitled to rely on representations, covenants and rulings of Parent and
      HoldCo, including the HoldCo Merger Parent Tax Certificate and the HoldCo
      Tax Certificate.

      from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a Professional Corporation, dated
      as of the date of the Second Company Merger Effective Time, in form and
      substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that, for
      U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) the Company Merger when taken

      within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) no gain or loss

      a fractional share of Parent Shares, provided that the Company (or its
      successor) complies with the reporting requirements contained in Treasury
      Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6), and such opinion shall not have been
      withdrawn; provided, however, that if Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati
      shall not render such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed
      satisfied if another law firm with a nationally recognized tax practice,
      as reasonably satisfactory to the Company (other than the law firm
      providing the opinion pursuant to Section 9.2(f) of the Agreement), shall
      render such opinion to the Company. In rendering such opinion, Wilson
      Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati or such other law firm, as the case may be, may
      require and be entitled to rely on representations, covenants and rulings
      of Parent and the Company, including the Company Merger Parent Tax
      Certificate and the Company Tax Certificate.

                                  TERMINATION

            Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the board of
directors of the terminating party or parties, and except as provided below,
whether before or after the requisite approval of the stockholders of HoldCo,
the Company or Parent:

                  (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the boards of
directors of Parent, HoldCo and the Company;

                  (b) by either Parent, HoldCo or the Company, if the Company
Effective Time has not occurred by January 31, 2004 which date may be extended
by either party to March 31, 2004, if the Mergers shall not have been
consummated as the result of a failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Section 9.1(c) or Section 9.1(f)) (as appropriate, the "End Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b)
and the right to extend the End Date will not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has


                                                                            -78-
<PAGE>
been the principal cause of the failure of the Mergers to be consummated by such
date and such failure constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

                  (c) by either the Company, HoldCo or Parent, if the required
approval of the stockholders of Parent contemplated by this Agreement has not
been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a meeting
of Parent stockholders duly convened therefor or at any adjournment thereof;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1(c) will not be available to Parent where the failure to obtain Parent
stockholder approval has been caused by the action or failure to act of Parent
and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by Parent of
this Agreement;

                  (d) by Parent, if the action by written consent of the HoldCo
representing the required approval of the stockholders of the Company
contemplated by this Agreement has been revoked, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction has issued an order, decree or ruling, in each case that such
action by written consent of the HoldCo is invalid and such order, decree or
ruling has become final and non-appealable, or if either the Company or the
HoldCo challenges the validity of, or attempts to revoke or repudiate, the
written consent of the HoldCo or publicly discloses any intention to do any of
the foregoing;

                  (e) by either the Company, HoldCo or Parent, if a court of
competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity will have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action, in each case permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other action
has become final and non-appealable;

                  (f) by either the Company or HoldCo, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth
in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent has become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.3(a) or
(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty will have become untrue; provided, that if such
inaccuracy in Parent's representations and warranties or breach by Parent is
curable by Parent prior to the End Date through the exercise of all reasonable
efforts, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section
10.1(f) prior to thirty (30) days following the receipt of written notice from
the Company to Parent of such breach; (it being understood that the Company may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f) if it will have
materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by Parent is cured so that
such conditions would then be satisfied);

                  (g) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of the Company has become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.2(a) or (b) would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or
warranty will have become untrue; provided, that if such inaccuracy in the
Company's representations and warranties or breach by the Company is curable by
the Company prior to the End Date through the


                                                                            -79-
<PAGE>
exercise of all reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 10.1(g) prior to thirty (30) days following the receipt of
written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach; (it being understood
that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(g) if
it will have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by the Company
is cured so that such conditions would then be satisfied);

                  (h) by Parent, if a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred since the date hereof and is continuing;

                  (i) by the Company, if a Parent Material Adverse Effect has
occurred since the date hereof and is continuing;

                  (j) by Parent, at any time prior to the adoption and approval
of the Company Proposals by the required vote of the stockholders of the
Company, if a Company Triggering Event shall have occurred;

                  (k) by the Company, at any time prior to the adoption and
approval of the Parent Proposals by the required vote of the stockholders of
Parent, if a Parent Triggering Event shall have occurred; or

                  (l) by the Company, if Parent's board of directors recommends
or Parent consummates a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with a
third party, in which Parent Shares are or would be converted into the right to
receive non-cash consideration which the Company's board of directors
determines, in good faith based on the advice of an independent financial
advisor and taking into account market value, liquidity and exchange listing,
would be less valuable to the Company's stockholders than the Parent Shares that
would otherwise be issued to the Company's stockholders in the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated hereby in absence of such other transaction.

            Section 10.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any
termination of this Agreement under Section 10.1 above will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating party
to the other party hereto. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect,
except (i) as set forth in Section 8.4 this Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 and
Article XII, each of which will survive the termination of this Agreement and
(ii) nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any material
breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement will affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations will survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms.

            Section 10.3 Fees and Expenses.

                  (a) General. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including fees and expenses of financial advisors, financial sponsors, legal
counsel and other advisors, will be paid by the party incurring such expenses
whether or not the Mergers


                                                                            -80-

are consummated; provided, however, that Parent and the Company will share
equally the filing fee for the Notification and Report Forms filed with the FTC
and DOJ under the HSR Act and pre-merger notification and reports forms under
similar applicable laws of other jurisdictions.

                  (b) Payments.

                        (i) Payment by the Company. The Company will promptly
      pay to Parent, but in no event later than two (2) business days after the
      date of such termination, a fee equal to twenty-one million dollars
      ($21,000,000) in immediately available funds (the "Termination Fee") in
      the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
      10.1(d) or 10.1(j).

                        (ii) Payment by Parent. Parent will promptly pay to the
      Company, but in no event later than two (2) business days after the date
      of such termination, the Termination Fee in immediately available funds in
      the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
      Section 10.1(k) or (B) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company
      or Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(c); provided, that such payment will be
      made in the case of termination pursuant to Section 10.1(c) if but only if
      (1) following the date hereof, and prior to such meeting of the Parent's
      stockholders referred to in Section 10.1(c), there shall have been
      publicly disclosed an offer or proposal with respect to an Acquisition by
      a third party and such third party publicly discloses its lack of support
      for the Mergers and (2) within twelve (12) months following the
      termination of this Agreement, Parent executes an agreement with respect
      to an Acquisition and an Acquisition is consummated within twenty-four
      (24) months following termination of this Agreement; provided, further,
      that, in the case of this clause (B) above, the Termination Fee will be
      payable only upon the consummation of an Acquisition, in which case, such
      payment will be made promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business
      days after the consummation of such Acquisition.

            Section 10.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of the
Parent Proposals by Parent's stockholders and approval of the Company Proposals
by Company's stockholders, provided that after approval of the Parent Proposals
by Parent's stockholders, no amendment will be made which by law or the rules of
the Nasdaq National Market requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3 and the Company.

            Section 10.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time any party hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective board
of directors,


                                                                            -81-

may, to the extent legally allowed (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will
not constitute a waiver of such right.

or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the Company

            Section 12.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as

to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

            Section 12.6 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon
a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy

equity.

itself to the Personal jurisdiction of any Delaware state court in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such Personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any
such court, and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than a state court sitting in the State of Delaware.

            Section 12.8 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

            Section 12.9 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by any
of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the

assign in accordance with the terms of this Section 12.9. Subject to the
preceding sentences, but without relieving any party hereto of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

            Section 12.10 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on
the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any
other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are
cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

            Section 12.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND
MERGER SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
