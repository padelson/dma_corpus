PURCHASE PRICE FOR BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.   (a) Buyer
may conduct, at its sole cost, such examinations and investigations
(including title examinations and investigations), as it may in its sole
discretion choose to   16   conduct to determine if any violations of the
representations or warranties in Article 3 and Article 4 exist. In order to
be entitled to assert the existence of any violation of a representation or
warranty in Article 3 or Article 4 under this Section 2.4, Buyer must deliver
to the Company and the Securityholder Representative on or before the Notice
Date a written notice (the "Defect Notice") specifying each defect that it
asserts constitutes a violation of the representations set forth in Article 3
or Article 4 (a "Rep and Warranty Defect"), a description of each such Rep
and Warranty Defect, the amount of the adjustment to the Total Preliminary
Aggregate Purchase Price that it asserts based on such defect and its method
of calculating such adjustment. If such Defect Notice is not timely
submitted, Buyer will be deemed to have waived all rights under this Section
2.4.   (b) Upon timely delivery of the Defect Notice, Buyer and the
Securityholders shall in good faith negotiate the validity of the claim
and the amount of any adjustment to the Total Preliminary Aggregate Purchase
Price using the following criteria:   (i) No adjustment will be made to the
Total Preliminary Aggregate Purchase Price under this Section 2.4 except to
the extent that the net total of all adjustments exceeds $1,250,000 in the
aggregate (the "Aggregate Defect Threshold"); by way of example, if the net
total of all adjustments under this Section 2.4 equals $1,300,000, then an
adjustment of $50,000 shall, subject to subsection (c) of this Section 2.4,
be made to the Total Preliminary Aggregate Purchase Price. The amount of any
adjustment for a Rep and Warranty Defect shall be determined without giving
effect to the knowledge qualifications contained in Article 3 and Article 4
and without giving effect to the materiality qualifications contained in
Section 3.2; Section 4.1; Section 4.3 (but giving effect to the use of the
term "Material Agreements" therein); Section 4.9; Sections 4.10(c) and (d);
Section 4.13(b); Section 4.14; Sections 4.16(a), (b), (c), (e) and (g);
Section 4.17; Section 4.20; Section 4.22; Section 4.23; Section 4.28; and
Sections 4.30(f), (g), (k) (but giving effect to the use of the term
"Material Agreements" therein and to materiality qualifications in subclause
(iv) thereof), (l) and (m). In addition, the amount of any adjustment for a
Rep and Warranty Defect with respect to Section 4.16 shall be determined
without giving effect to any disclosures made on Schedule 4.16 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that effect shall be given to
disclosures on Schedule 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule of
past environmental matters that have been remediated in accordance with
applicable Environmental Law.   (ii) If the requested adjustment is based
on the Company owning a net revenue interest as to a particular Ownership
Interest less than that shown in the Schedule 1.1-C of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, then a downward adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the
Allocated Value set forth for such Ownership Interest by a fraction (A) the
numerator of which is an amount equal to the net revenue interest shown on
Schedule 1.1-C of the Company Disclosure Schedule for such Ownership Interest
less the decimal share to which the Company would be entitled as a result of
its Ownership Interest which is unaffected by such Rep and Warranty Defect
and (B) the denominator of which is the net revenue interest shown on
Schedule 1.1-C of the Company Disclosure Schedule for such Ownership
Interest. Any downward adjustments requested by Buyer may be offset by upward
adjustments if it is determined that the Company\'s net revenue interest for
all or part of any Ownership Interests is greater than that shown in Schedule
1.1-C of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   17    (iii) If the requested
adjustment is based on the Company owning a working interest as to a
particular Ownership Interest that is larger than the working interest shown
in Schedule 1.1-C of the Company Disclosure Schedule, but without a
proportionate increase in the Company\'s net revenue interest as to such
Ownership Interest, then the adjustment is calculated by (x) determining the
effective net revenue interest that results from such larger working
interest, (y) determining what the net revenue interest would be using such
effective net revenue interest and the working interest shown in Schedule
1.1-C of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (z) then calculating the
adjustment in the manner set forth in clause (ii) preceding (including the
effect of any offsets due to upward adjustments). By way of example, with
respect to an Ownership Interest with an Allocated Value of $1,000,000, if
the Company owns a 60% working interest instead of a 50% working interest and
a 45% net revenue interest instead of a 40% net revenue interest, then the
downward adjustment of $62,500.00 to the Total Preliminary Aggregate Purchase
Price (assuming the Aggregate Defect Threshold had been exceeded) would be
calculated as follows:   (w) Ownership Interest: 50% WI, 40% NRI, 80%
Effective NRI   (x) Defect Interest: 60% WI, 45% NRI, 75% Effective NRI  
(y) Adjustment Percentage: (.80 - .75)/.80 = .0625   (z) Downward
Adjustment: .0625 x $1,000,000 = $62,500.00   (iv) If the requested
adjustment is based on a Lien or other monetary charge upon a particular
Ownership Interest that is liquidated in amount, then the adjustment is the
amount necessary to remove such Lien or other monetary charge from the
affected Ownership Interest.   (v) In respect of the representation
and warranty contained in Section 4.21, if the Company\'s net gas
underproduced position as to its Ownership Interests is equal to or greater
than 100,000 Mcf, then no adjustment shall be made to the Total Preliminary
Aggregate Purchase Price. If the Company\'s net gas underproduced position as
to its Ownership Interests is less than 100,000 Mcf (such amount shall be
referred to as the "Underproduction Amount"), then the Total Preliminary
Aggregate Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the amount equal to the product
derived from multiplying $1.50 by the sum of 100,000 minus the
Underproduction Amount.   (vi) If the requested adjustment is based on
a violation of a representation or warranty that is not adjusted pursuant
to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this Section 2.4(b), then the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith regarding the validity of the claim and the
amount of any adjustment to the Total Preliminary Aggregate Purchase
Price.   (vii) No fact, circumstance or condition of the title to an
Ownership Interest shall be considered to effect a reduction in the value of
the Ownership Interest, unless due consideration has been given to (x) the
length of time that such Ownership Interest has been producing
Hydrocarbon substances and has been credited to and accounted for by the
Company   18   and its predecessors in title, if any, and (y) whether any
such fact, circumstance or condition is of the type that can generally be
expected to be encountered in the area involved and is usually and
customarily acceptable to (and thus not considered to create an adverse
effect on value by) reasonable and prudent operators, interest owners and
purchasers engaged in the business of the ownership, development and
operation of oil and gas properties.   (c) As an alternative to adjusting
the Total Preliminary Aggregate Purchase Price, the Company may elect to cure
all or certain of the asserted Rep and Warranty Defects, provided that such
cure period shall only extend until the fifth calendar day after the Notice
Date.   (d) If Buyer and the Company are unable to reach agreement within
five (5) calendar days after the Notice Date as to the validity of claims and
amounts for adjustments to the Total Preliminary Aggregate Purchase Price, or
as to the sufficiency of any cure pursuant to Section 2.4(c), then such
disagreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with
Section 10.20.   (e) Any adjustment made to the Total Preliminary Aggregate
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall only be enforceable when
evidenced by (i) an amendment to this Agreement executed by Buyer and
the Securityholders acting through the Securityholder Representative or (ii)
by arbitrative order rendered in accordance with Section 10.20. With respect
to determining the adjustment under this Section 2.4 to the Closing
Aggregate Purchase Price payable to a Securityholder, the amount of any such
adjustment shall be allocated on a pro rata basis to all Securityholders
based on the number set forth with respect to each Securityholder under the
column entitled "Number of Shares Owned and Subject to Options" in Schedule
C-1.   2.5 ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO PRELIMINARY AGGREGATE
PURCHASE PRICE.   (a) To arrive at the Closing Aggregate Purchase
Price payable to a Securityholder, the Preliminary Aggregate Purchase Price
payable to such Securityholder shall be adjusted (in addition to any
adjustments made as a result of Rep and Warranty Defects) as follows:   (i)
upward or downward by (A) taking the positive or negative difference between
Final Working Capital and Preliminary Working Capital and dividing the amount
by 2,975 and (B) multiplying the result under the preceding clause (A) by the
sum of (x) number of Shares owned by the Securityholder as set forth on
Schedule A and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Options held by the Securityholder as set forth on Schedule
B;   (ii) upward or downward by (A) taking the positive or negative
difference between the Preliminary Debt Amount and the Final Debt Amount and
dividing the amount by 2,975, and (B) multiplying the result under the
preceding clause (A) by the sum of (x) number of Shares owned by the

requirements of the Code in form and operation. All liabilities associated

and in such manner as will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to all of the
assets, properties, books and records, contracts, facilities, audit and tax
work papers, information systems and computer networks, and payroll records
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including access to the Operated

shall not be obligated under the terms of this Section 6.2 to disclose to
Buyer or the Buyer Representatives, or grant Buyer or the Buyer
Representatives access to, information that is within the

without first obtaining the consent of such third party, and the Company, to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, will use its reasonable efforts to
obtain any such consent and (ii) is subject to an attorney/client or attorney
work product privilege ("Company Privileged Information"); provided, however,
that with respect to any information that the Company claims is Company
Privileged Information, the Company agrees to describe such information as
fully and completely as reasonably possible without resulting in the loss of
such privilege or disclosing specific legal advice and to reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in providing additional information reasonably requested
by Buyer, in as much detail as reasonably possible while maintaining the
confidential or privileged nature of such information.   6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL
STUDIES. The Company hereby acknowledges Buyer\'s right to conduct a Phase I
environmental analysis (as contemplated by the most recent version of ASTM
1527E) of the Operating Properties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, prior to the Closing, no further inspections, including
invasive or intrusive samplings or studies, may be conducted by Buyer, its

properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries without the consent of the

discretion. The Company shall advise Buyer as to whether it consents to such
further inspections within three calendar days of Buyer\'s written request to
conduct same.   6.4 THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. After the date hereof and prior to

with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,

announcement is required by any laws (including common law), statutes, rules,
regulations, ordinances, judgments, orders, decrees, injunctions and writs of
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the business or
operations of the Company or Buyer; and provided further, that either the
Company or Buyer may respond to inquiries by the press or others regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, so long as such responses
are consistent with such party\'s previously issued press releases.   (b)
From and after the date hereof, each Restricted Party agrees, severally and
not jointly with any other Person, to keep confidential and protect, and not
divulge or otherwise allow access to any and all information of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising out of the business or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including any and all notes,
analyses, compilations, studies, summaries and other material containing or
based, in whole or in part, on any such information (the "Confidential
Information"). Each Restricted Party agrees, severally and not jointly with
any other Person, that such Confidential Information constitutes a unique and
valuable asset, and that any disclosure of such Confidential Information in
breach of this Section 6.5(b) would be wrongful and would cause irreparable
harm to Buyer. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality will not apply to
any Confidential Information (i) that is now or subsequently
becomes generally publicly known, other than as a direct or indirect result
of the breach of this Agreement by any Restricted Party, (ii) that a
Restricted Party receives from a third party without obligation of
confidentiality, (iii) that a Restricted Party independently develops after
Closing or (iv) that is learned or developed by a Restricted Party as a
result of his or its general experience in the oil and gas business. Each
Restricted Party agrees, severally and not jointly with any other Person,
that the provisions and restrictions contained in this Section 6.5(b) are
necessary to protect the legitimate continuing interests of Buyer in
acquiring the Company and entering into this Agreement, that the covenants in
this Section 6.5(b) have been specifically bargained for, that any violation
or breach of such provisions and restrictions will result in irreparable
injury to Buyer for which a remedy at law would be inadequate and that, in
addition to any relief at law that may be available to Buyer for
such violation or breach and regardless of any other provision contained in
this Agreement, Buyer will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable
relief restraining such violation or breach (without any requirement that
Buyer provide any bond or other security). All obligations arising under this
Section 6.5(b) shall terminate in full as of the first anniversary of the
Closing Date.   6.6 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. The Company shall give
prompt written notice to Buyer of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event of which it has knowledge that has caused any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect as of the date of this Agreement and (b)
the failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant to be complied with   43   by it hereunder. No such
notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the parties or
the conditions to their respective obligations hereunder.   6.7 NO
NEGOTIATIONS. None of the Securityholders, the Company, its Subsidiaries nor
their officers, directors, employees, Affiliates,
stockholders, representatives, agents, nor anyone acting on behalf of any of
them shall, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, initiate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, provide any nonpublic information or
assistance to, or consider the merits of any unsolicited inquiries or
proposals from, any Person (other than Buyer) concerning any merger, sale of
assets, purchase or sale of equity securities or similar transaction
involving, directly or indirectly, the Company or its Subsidiaries unless
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Article 8.
The Company shall notify Buyer of such inquiries or proposals (including in
such notification the identity of the Person making the inquiry or proposal
and the terms thereof), if any, and of any subsequent communications by the
Person making such inquiry or proposal, in each case within 24 hours of the
making thereof.   6.8 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. From and after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
to, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, make available
to each Securityholder and their respective representatives (including
counsel and independent auditors) reasonable access to all financial and Tax
information, files, documents and records (written and computer) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent that such access is reasonably
required in order for a Securityholder to comply with a Tax or other legally
required reporting obligation or Tax or legal dispute (excluding any such
dispute in which the Company, Buyer or any of their Affiliates may be an
adverse party) arising out of any period prior to and including the Closing
Date. Any such access shall be at the sole cost and expense of the respective
Securityholder.   6.9 INVESTIGATION AND AGREEMENT BY BUYER; NO OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES.   (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it
has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has
formed an independent judgment concerning, the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective businesses and operations, and Buyer has been furnished
with or given full access to such information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations as they
requested. In connection with Buyer\'s investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations, Buyer and its
representatives have received from the Company or its representatives certain
projections and other forecasts for the Company and its Subsidiaries and
certain estimates, plans and budget information. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets, (ii) Buyer is familiar
with such uncertainties, (iii) Buyer is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluations of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them or its
representatives and (iv) Buyer will not (and will cause all of
its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates and all other Persons acting on its
behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of action against the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of the Company\'s direct or indirect directors, officers,
employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates, consultants, counsel,
accountants, investment bankers or representatives with respect thereto, or
hold any such other Person liable with respect thereto.   44    (b)
Buyer agrees that, except for the representations and warranties in Articles
3 and 4 of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its respective
Affiliates has made and shall not be deemed to have made to Buyer or to any
of its representatives or Affiliates any representation or warranty of any
kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer is not
relying upon any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of
future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or
any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or
future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or
made available to Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective counsel,
accountants, advisors, lenders or other representatives.   (c) The Company
acknowledges and agrees that except for the representations and warranties
made by Buyer as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates has made and shall not be construed as having made to the
Company or any Affiliate thereof any representation or warranty of any
kind.   6.10 INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) From and after the Closing, each of
the Securityholders shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Company, Buyer and their Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, controlling persons, agents and
representatives (the foregoing references to Affiliates, directors, officers,

to the Seal Agreement), whenever arising, related to (i) individuals
performing services for the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate at any time prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefit plans or
arrangements of any kind with respect to any such individuals, including for
purposes of clauses (i) and (ii), (A) any obligation pursuant to COBRA (or
any equivalent state continuation coverage requirement) to provide post-
employment group health plan coverage to any employee or former employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary, and (B) any obligation for any income and
employment Tax withholding, reporting or payment obligations (including FICA,

the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall

be terminated prior to the Closing and the transactions contemplated
hereunder may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:   (a) by
mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;   (b) by Buyer if the
Company refuses to consent to Buyer\'s conducting further inspections,
including invasive or intrusive samplings and studies, as contemplated by
Section 6.3 hereof;   (c) by either Buyer or the Company:   (i) if the

more than $5,000,000;   (ii) if there shall have been any breach by
the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set

breach of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or before such date.   8.2 EFFECT OF

Company or Buyer as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith

part of Buyer, the Company or any Securityholder or their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or stockholders, except (a)
Article 8 and Article 10 shall survive such termination and (b) no such
termination shall relieve any party from liability for breach of any term or
provision hereof, provided that no party shall have any liability
or obligation hereunder in the event of a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or 8.1(c)(i).   8.3 RETURN OF DOCUMENTATION.

PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES. Each member of the Restricted Group agrees, severally
and not jointly with any other Person, that except as otherwise provided
herein such member of the Restricted Group will not, during the period
beginning on the date hereof and ending with respect to the covenants set
forth in Sections 9.1(a)(i), 9.1(a)(ii), 9.1(b) (insofar as it pertains to
a Relevant Geographic Area described in Section 9.1(a)(i) or 9.1(a)(ii))
and 9.1(c) (insofar as it pertains to a Relevant Geographic Area described
in Section 9.1(a)(i) or 9.1(a)(ii)), on the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, and with respect to the covenants set forth in Section 9.1(a)(iii),
9.1(b) (insofar as it pertains to a Relevant Geographic Area described in
Section 9.1(a)(iii)) and 9.1(c) (insofar as it pertains to a Relevant
Geographic Area described in Section 9.1(a)(iii)) below, on the date six
months immediately following the Closing Date (as applicable, the "Restricted
Period"), directly or indirectly, for any reason, for such member\'s own
account or on behalf of or together with any other Person: (a) acquire, for
such member\'s own account or the account of any business in which he owns
more than 1% of the outstanding capital stock, (i) in the case of Ownership
Interests in Operated Properties in Denton County, Texas and Tarrant County,
Texas, any interest in any oil or natural gas property within a one-mile
radius of any such Operated Properties, (ii) in the case of all other
Ownership Interests in Operated Properties, any interest in any oil or
natural gas property on which such Ownership Interests are located or (iii)
in the case of Ownership Interests that are not in Operated Properties, any
interest in any oil or natural gas property on which such Ownership Interests
are located (collectively, the "Relevant Geographic Area"), (b) accept
employment, advise, assist or render service in any way to any Person that
competes directly with the Company in the acquisition,
exploration, development, exploitation or production of oil and natural gas
in the Relevant Geographic Area or (c) enter into or take part in or lend his
name, counsel or assistance to any business, either as proprietor, principal,
investor, partner, director, officer, executive, consultant, advisor, agent,
independent contractor, or in any other capacity whatsoever, for any purpose
that would be directly competitive with the acquisition, exploration,
development, exploitation or production   49   activities of the Company
or any of its affiliated companies in the Relevant Geographic Area.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set forth in this Section 9.1
shall not apply or otherwise restrict any member of the Restricted Group from
acquiring any ownership interest in property included in the
Relevant Geographic Area and otherwise restricted pursuant to this Section
9.1 if such property (A) is not an Operated Property or the acquired
ownership is in the form of a royalty interest and (B) does not have a PV-10%
value in the Reserve Report of greater than $250,000. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any member of the Restricted Group may own and hold as a passive
investment up to 5% of the outstanding capital stock of a competing Person if
that class of capital stock is listed on a national stock exchange or
included in the Nasdaq National Market. Further, notwithstanding the
foregoing, each member of the Restricted Group may acquire interests in
properties that are within the Relevant Geographic Area (other than
properties within the boundaries of the real property described in the Furst
Ranch Oil and Gas Lease) and otherwise restricted pursuant to this Section
9.1(a) (collectively, the "Restricted Properties") if such acquisition
transaction is with one or more third parties and the Restricted Properties
do not constitute more than 20% of the aggregate value of such acquisition
transaction. For purposes of this Section 9.1, the word "acquire" and
correlative terms shall mean and include all direct and indirect
acquisitions, whether individually or through or in combination with another
Person, and whether consummated through a purchase, lease,
merger, consolidation, exchange, business combination or other transaction,
in a single transaction or series of transactions.   9.2 INJUNCTIONS AND
RESTRAINING ORDERS. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses to
Buyer as a result of any breach by a member of the Restricted Group of such
member\'s covenants in Section 9.1, and because of the immediate and
irreparable damage that could be caused to Buyer for which it would have no
other adequate remedy, each member of the Restricted Group agrees that Buyer
may enforce the provisions of Section 9.1 by injunctions and restraining
orders against that member if such member breaches any of
those provisions.   9.3 RESTRAINT. The parties hereto each agree that
Sections 9.1 and 9.2 impose a reasonable restraint on the Restricted Group in
light of the activities and business of Buyer on the date hereof and the
current business plans of Buyer.   9.4 SEVERABILITY; REFORMATION. The
covenants in this Article 9 are severable and separate, and the
unenforceability of any specific covenant in this Article 9 is not intended
by any party hereto to, and shall not, affect the provisions of any other
covenant in this Article 9. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions set forth in
Section 9.1 are unreasonable as applied to any member of the Restricted
Group, the parties hereto, including that member of the Restricted Group,
acknowledge their mutual intention and agreement that those restrictions be
enforced to the fullest extent the court deems reasonable, and thereby
shall be reformed to that extent as applied to that member and any other
member of the Restricted Group similarly situated.   9.5 INDEPENDENT
COVENANT. All the covenants in this Article 9 are intended by each party
hereto to, and shall, be construed as an agreement independent of any other
provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of
action of any member of the Restricted Group against Buyer, whether
predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to
the enforcement by Buyer of any covenant in this Article 9. It is  
50   specifically agreed that the period specified in Section 9.1 shall be
extended in the case of each member of the Restricted Group by the time
during which that member is in violation of any provision of Section 9.1. The
covenants contained in this Article 9 shall not be affected by any breach of
any other provision hereof by any party hereto.   9.6 MATERIALITY. The
Company and each member of the Restricted Group, severally and not jointly
with any other Person, hereby agree that this Article 9 is a material and
substantial part of the transactions contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE 10 
MISCELLANEOUS   10.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Except
as expressly provided in Section 6.10, none of the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing. Except as expressly
provided in Section 2.4 and Section 6.10, the representations and warranties
contained herein are to serve only as a basis for a party to assert, under
Article 7, that the conditions to Closing have not been met and, under
Article 8, that it has a specified termination right. Accordingly, after
Closing and except as provided in Section 6.10 no party hereto shall have any
liability to any other party hereto based upon any representation or warranty
made herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection with
this Agreement. After the Closing, the provisions of Section 6.10 shall be
Buyer\'s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company, HRM or any
Securityholder.   10.2 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. This Agreement may only
be amended by written agreement of the Company, Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative or, as provided in Section 10.19, the applicable
Securityholder.   10.3 NOTICES.   (a) Any notice or other communication

SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions

arising in whole or in part under, related to, based on, or in

whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement except as expressly set forth
herein.   10.9 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (which term shall be
deemed to include the exhibits and schedules hereto and the other
certificates, documents and instruments delivered hereunder) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto and supersede all prior agreements, letters of intent and

subject matter hereof. There are no representations or warranties, agreements
or covenants other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the

GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS,
WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS.   10.11
ASSIGNMENT. Except with respect to certain rights and obligations assigned to
the Securityholder Representative as provided by this Agreement, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.   10.12 WAIVERS. At any time prior to the Closing, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
performance of any of the covenants or agreements, or satisfaction of any of
the conditions, contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Except as provided in this  
53   Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereof shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof.   10.13
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT. The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall constitute a part of
this Agreement for all purpose and shall remain in full force and effect

its terms; provided, however, immediately after the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate without any further
action by any party thereto.   10.14 INCORPORATION. Exhibits and Schedules
referred to herein are attached to and by this reference incorporated herein
for all purposes.   10.15 COOPERATION AFTER CLOSING. Each party shall, at
any time and from time to time after Closing, execute, acknowledge where
appropriate and deliver such further instruments and documents and take such
other action as may be reasonably requested by another party in order to
carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement.   10.16 RULES OF
CONSTRUCTION.   (a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has
been represented, or has been advised of its right to be represented, by
independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have
preceded the execution of this Agreement. Each party and its counsel
cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the
documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto shall
be deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed against
any party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against any party that draft it is of no application and is hereby
expressly waived.   (b) The inclusion of any information in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of
such information in the Company Disclosure Schedule, that such information is
required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or that such items
are material to the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any headers, footers or
other references indicating a date as of which any schedule or any list,
memorandum, spreadsheet or other attachment to any schedule was prepared or
otherwise purporting to indicate any date as of which any such information
speaks shall have no effect on the dates or times as of which any
representation or warranty in this Agreement is made. The headings, if any,
of the individual sections of each of the Company Disclosure Schedules are
inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part
thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule is
arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in this Agreement
merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a particular representation or
warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to
all other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of
such item to   54   such representations or warranties is readily
apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of
an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to
such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference
thereto.   (c) The specification of any dollar amount in
the representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the
Company Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement.   10.17 EXPENSES AND OBLIGATIONS. Except as otherwise set
forth herein, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne solely and entirely by the party that has incurred such expenses. As
provided in Section 2.1, Buyer shall pay the Company Legal Costs on the
Closing Date. If any Company Legal Costs are submitted to the Company after
the Closing Date, such fees shall be paid by the Securityholders, pro rata in
accordance with their ownership of the Shares immediately prior to
Closing.   10.18 RELEASE. Subject to the limitations set forth in the
last sentence in this Section 10.18, as of the Closing Date each
Securityholder shall be deemed to unconditionally and irrevocably release and
forever discharge, effective as of and forever after the Closing Date, to the
fullest extent permitted by laws (including common law), statutes, rules,
regulations, ordinances, judgments, orders, decrees, injunctions and writs of
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Securityholder, each
of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
HRM) and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel
and representatives (collectively, the "Released Parties") from any and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, claims, demands, actions or causes of
action, suits, judgments or controversies of any kind whatsoever that
Securityholder may possess (collectively, "Pre-Acquisition Claims") against
the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than HRM), if any, or any of them
that arises out of or is based on any agreement or understanding or act or
failure to act (including any act or failure to act that constitutes ordinary
or gross negligence or reckless or willful, wanton misconduct),
misrepresentation, omission, transaction, fact, event or other matter
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (whether based at law or in equity
or otherwise, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, known or unknown,
accrued or not accrued) (collectively, "Pre-Acquisition Matters"), including:
(a) claims by the Securityholder with respect to repayment of loans or
indebtedness; (b) any rights, titles and interests in, to or under any
agreements, arrangements or understandings to which the Securityholder is
a party; and (c) claims by the Securityholder with respect to dividends,
violation of preemptive rights, or payment of salaries or other compensation
or in any way arising out of or in connection with the Securityholder\'s
employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than HRM), the
cessation of that employment, the Securityholder\'s status as an officer,
director, stockholder or optionholder of the Company or otherwise. Each
Securityholder further agrees, from and after the Closing Date, not to file
or bring any claim before any Governmental Authority on the basis of or
respecting any Pre-Acquisition Claim concerning any Pre-Acquisition Matter
against any Released Party. Each Securityholder (a) acknowledges that such
Securityholder fully comprehends and understands all the terms of this
Section 10.18 and their legal effects and (b)   55   expressly represents
and warrants that (i) such Securityholder is competent to effect the release
made in this Section 10.18 knowingly and voluntarily and without reliance on
any statement or representation of any Released Party or its representatives
and (ii) such Securityholder had the opportunity to consult with an attorney
of such Securityholder\'s choice regarding this Section
10.18. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 10.18 shall not affect the
rights and remedies of the Securityholders with respect to (A) this
Agreement, including Section 6.11 and (B) any rights against HRM.   10.19
APPOINTMENT OF ATTORNEY-IN-FACT.   (a) C. Randall Hill (the "Securityholder
Representative") (and any successor appointed to act on its behalf in
accordance with this Section 10.19), hereby is appointed, authorized and
empowered to act, on behalf of the Securityholders, in connection with, and
to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement and the related transaction documents, and in connection with the
activities to be performed on behalf of the Securityholders under this
Agreement.   (b) Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to
rely exclusively upon the communications of the Securityholder
Representative relating to the communications of the Securityholders. Buyer
need not be concerned with, and shall be entitled to rely on, the authority
of the Securityholder Representative to act on behalf of all Securityholders
hereunder, and shall not be held liable or accountable in any manner for any
act or omission of the Securityholder Representative in such capacity.  
(c) Except as set forth in the following sentence, the Securityholder
Representative may enter into and grant any amendments, modifications,
waivers or consents with respect to this Agreement and the related
transaction documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the Securityholder Representative may not enter into or
grant any amendments, modifications, waivers or consents with respect to this
Agreement unless such amendments, modifications, waivers or consents
shall affect each Securityholder similarly and to the same relative extent,
and (ii) any such amendment, modification, waiver or consent which does not
affect any Securityholder similarly and to the same relative extent as it
affects other Securityholders must be executed by such Securityholder to be
binding on such Securityholder.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Securityholders Representative in its role as
Securityholder Representative shall have no liability whatsoever to the
Company or Buyer.   (e) In the event of the death, disability or
incapacity of the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholders may
appoint a substitute therefor. The Securityholders shall act by majority vote
in interest. Each Securityholder, by his or her execution of this Agreement,
hereby irrevocably appoints the Securityholder Representative as his or her
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for all purposes of this Agreement.   (f)
The grant of authority provided for in this Section 10.19 is coupled with an
interest and is being granted, in part, as an inducement to the parties to
enter into this   56   Agreement and shall be irrevocable and survive the
death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Securityholder and
shall be binding on any successor thereto.   10.20 ARBITRATION.   (a) Any
dispute arising under Sections 2.4 or 2.5(c), which cannot be resolved by
mutual agreement, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding
arbitration in the State of Texas, County of Tarrant, in accordance with the
commercial arbitration rules of the AAA, except as otherwise provided herein.
Either Buyer or the Company may invoke arbitration of such issue by serving
