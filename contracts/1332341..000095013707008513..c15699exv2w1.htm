 (a) _Company Units_. 

   

 (i) Each of the Companys Class A units ("Class A Units"), Class B units ("Class B Units") and Class C units ("Class C Units" and, together with the Class A Units and Class B Units, "Units") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Units to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_, will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to _Section 1.6(d)_) into the right to receive, respectively, the Class A Per Unit Consideration, the Class B Per Unit Consideration or the Class C Per Unit Consideration (together with the Class A Per Unit Consideration and the Class B Per Unit Consideration, the "Per Unit Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate representing such Unit in the manner provided in _Section 1.7_. 

  

 (ii) The applicable Per Unit Consideration to be paid in exchange for each Unit as provided in _Section 1.6(a)(i)_ shall include shares of common stock of Parent, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent Common Stock") and/or cash ("Cash Consideration") as provided on Exhibit A hereto. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Units_. Each Unit held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

   

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each unit of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable unit of the Surviving Company. 

   

 (d) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Units who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Units in accordance with _Section 1.7(c_), receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding taxes as contemplated by _Section 1.7(f)_, which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) most recent trading days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day one day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq"). 

   

 (e) _Adjustments to Per Unit Consideration_. The applicable Per Unit Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse 

     ##### 

   

    

stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect
to Parent Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 1.7  _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Parent hereby designates Wells Fargo or such other party as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree upon to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger. 

  

 (b) _Parent to Provide Cash and/or Common Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time (and in any event not less than two (2) days prior to the Closing), Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which shall provide that Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this _Article I_, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and/or cash payable in exchange for outstanding Units pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_. In addition, Parent shall make available as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_ and any dividends or distributions which holders of Units may be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_. Any cash and/or Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time but in any event within two (2) business days, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a Unit or Units that were converted into the right to receive the applicable Per Unit Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ _1.7(d)_ : (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that surrender of Units shall be effected only upon delivery of the letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Units in exchange for (1) the applicable Per Unit Consideration, (2) cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_ and (3) any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_. Upon delivery of such Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Units surrendered by such Letter of Transmittal shall be entitled to receive in exchange for each such Unit the applicable Per Unit Consideration (after taking into account all Units surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_, payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_ and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_, and the Units so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Any shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Units shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or is otherwise required by applicable law or regulation. Until so surrendered, each Unit will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of the applicable Per Unit Consideration (which shall include Cash Consideration and/or the number of 

   ##### 

  

    

full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Units shall have been so
converted) and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance
of any fractional shares in accordance with _Section 1.6(d)_ and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 1.7(d)_. 

  

 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Units_. No dividends or other distributions declared with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any Unit with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Unit shall surrender such Unit pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Unit, there shall be paid to the record holder of the Units evidencing full shares of Parent Common Stock that may be issued in exchange therefore pursuant to  _Section 1.6(a)_, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such full shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership_.

rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional
Assignees. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party
hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon,

their respective successors and assigns.
