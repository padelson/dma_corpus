  Exhibit C |  | Disclosure Schedules to Contribution Agreement CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

 

This CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (as it may be amended, modified or amended and
restated from time to time, this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 1, 2015,
is made and entered into by and between Westmoreland Coal Company, a Delaware
corporation (" _Contributor_ "), and Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP,
a Delaware limited partnership (the " _Partnership_ "). Contributor and the
Partnership are sometimes referred to in this Agreement individually as a "
_Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_."

RECITALS

 

A. Contributor owns 100% of the Membership Interests.

 

B. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Contributor desires
to contribute to the Partnership (through the Operating Company), and the
Partnership desires to accept from Contributor (through the Operating
Company), the Membership Interests (the " _Partnership Consideration_ "), in
exchange for (i) $135,000,000 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), (ii) an
aggregate number of Common Units as determined pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_
(the " _Common Units Consideration_ ") and (iii) an aggregate number of Series
A Convertible Units as determined pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ (the "
_Series A Convertible Units Consideration_ " and, together with the Common
Units Consideration, the " _Equity Consideration_ "). 

C. On June 1, 2015 Westmoreland Kemmerer, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Contributor, was converted (the " _Conversion_ ")
into a Delaware limited liability company named Westmoreland Kemmerer LLC.

D. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the contribution
of the Partnership Consideration in exchange for the Contributor Consideration
will, to the maximum extent permitted under the Code and Treasury Regulations,
qualify as an exchange to which Section 721(a) of the Code applies.

E. The Partnership Board has determined that it is in the best interests of
the Partnership, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Transaction_ "). The Conflicts
Committee has determined that the Transaction is in the best interests of the
Partnership and is fair and reasonable to the Partnership and to the
Unaffiliated Holders.

F. The Board of Directors of Contributor has determined it is in the best
interests of the Contributor and its stockholders, and declared it advisable,
for the Contributor to enter into this Agreement and the Transaction.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CONTRIBUTOR

 

Contributor hereby represents and warrants to the Partnership as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date (except for such representations and
warranties expressly made as of a specified date) as follows:

3.1 Existence; Qualification.

 

(a) Contributor is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
organizational power, authority, material governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals to own, lease

 



\- 4 -  and operate its properties, including the Membership Interests, and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. Contributor is duly qualified,
registered or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which it currently conducts businesses or
owns, operates, leases, licenses, uses or operates any properties or assets,
except where the failure to be so duly qualified, registered or licensed and
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Contributor
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) As of the Closing Date, Kemmerer is a limited liability company duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware and has all requisite organizational power, authority, material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to own and
lease its properties, including the Assets, and to operate its properties. As
of the Closing Date, Kemmerer is duly qualified, registered or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which it currently conducts businesses or owns,
operates, leases, licenses, uses or operates any properties or assets, except
where the failure to be so duly qualified, registered or licensed and in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Contributor Material
Adverse Effect. As of the Closing Date, Contributor has delivered to the
Partnership true, correct and complete copies of the Organizational Documents
of Kemmerer, as in effect on the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, all
such Organizational Documents are in full force and effect, and Kemmerer is
not in violation of any provision of its Organizational Documents.

 

3.2 Validity of Agreement, Authorization. Contributor has the requisite power
and authority to enter into the Transaction Documents to which it is or will
be party, and to carry out its obligations thereunder. The execution and
delivery of the Transaction Documents and the performance of Contributors
obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by the board of directors of
Contributor, and no other proceedings on the part of Contributor are necessary
to authorize such execution, delivery and performance. Each of the Transaction
Documents to which Contributor is or will be a party has been (in the case of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents executed on the date
hereof), or will be at the Closing (in the case of any other Transaction
Documents), duly executed and delivered by Contributor and constitutes, or
will constitute when executed, as applicable, Contributors valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against Contributor in accordance with its terms
(except as its enforceability may be limited by the Remedies Exception).

 

3.3 Consents and Approvals. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ of the
Contributor Disclosure Schedules, no consent, approval, waiver or
authorization of, or declaration, filing, registration or qualification with,
or notice to, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is necessary for
the consummation by Contributor of the Transaction,

 

3.4 No Conflicts. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.4_ of the Contributor
Disclosure Schedules, the execution, delivery and performance by Contributor
of the Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party, and the
consummation by Contributor of the Transaction, do not (a) violate any
provision of any Law applicable to Contributor or its Subsidiaries or
by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound, (b) result in
any breach or violation of any provision of the Organizational Documents of
Contributor or any of its Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing Date,
Kemmerer), (c) constitute a default (or an event that with the giving of
notice or passage of time or both would give rise to a default) or cause any

 



\- 5 -  obligation under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
amendment, preferential purchase right or acceleration (with or without the
giving of notice or the passage of time or both) under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Contributor or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing Date, Kemmerer) is a party or by
which any property or asset of any of Contributor or any of its Subsidiaries
(including as of the Closing Date, Kemmerer) is bound or affected, or (d)
constitute (with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time or
both) an event which would result in the creation of any Lien (other
than Permitted Liens) on the Membership Interests or any asset of Kemmerer,
except, in the cases of clauses (a), (c) and (d), for such defaults or rights
of termination, cancellation, amendment, acceleration, violations or Liens as
would not reasonably be expected to (i) have a Contributor Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transaction
party or (iii) materially impair Contributors ability to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

3.5 Capitalization of Kemmerer and Ownership, Condition and Sufficiency of
the Assets.

(a) As of the Closing Date:

 

(i) Contributor is the record owner of and has good and valid title to the
Membership Interests, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens),

(ii) the Membership Interests constitute 100% of the total issued and
outstanding membership interests in Kemmerer,

(iii) the Membership Interests have been duly authorized and are validly
issued, fully-paid (to the extent required by the Organizational Documents of
Kemmerer) and non-assessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected
by Sections 18-607 and 18-804 of the Delaware LLC Act), and

 

(iv) the Membership Interests were not issued in violation of the
Organizational Documents of Kemmerer or any other agreement, arrangement or
commitment to which Contributor or Kemmerer is a party and are not subject to
or in violation of any preemptive or similar rights of any Person.

 

(b) Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Partnership will own all of the Membership Interests. As of the Closing Date:

(i) the Membership Interests were issued in compliance with Law;

 

(ii) there are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants, convertible
securities or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character relating to any membership interests in Kemmerer or obligating
Contributor or Kemmerer to issue or sell any membership interests (including
the Membership Interests), or any other interest, in Kemmerer, and

 



\- 6 - (iii) other than the Organizational Documents, there are no voting
trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings in effect with respect
to the voting or transfer of any of the Membership Interests.

(c) As of the Closing, Kemmerer has (i) good and valid title to the Assets
and (ii) all of the real property rights sufficient to conduct the Kemmerer
Mining Operation, in both cases free and clear of all Liens except Permitted
Liens and those Liens set forth on _Schedule 3.5(c)_ of the Contributor
Disclosure Schedules. The Assets include all of the real property, contract
rights, Permit rights and equipment that, in the aggregate and together with
the Transferred Reserves, is required for the coal mining operations at the
Kemmerer Mine as such mining operations have been conducted during the 12
month period preceding the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) Neither Contributor nor, as of the Closing Date, Kemmerer, is a party to
any agreements, arrangements or commitments obligating Contributor to grant,
deliver or sell, or cause to be granted, delivered or sold, the Assets, by
sale, lease, license or otherwise, other than this Agreement, and other than
inventory sold by Kemmerer to its customers in the Ordinary Course of
Business.

 

(e) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the assignment of the
Membership Interests as contemplated by this Agreement gives rise to
any rights of first refusal, rights of first offer or similar rights under
any agreement to which Kemmerer or Contributor is a party that would entitle
any Person to purchase or otherwise acquire any of the Assets or Membership
Interests or require that an offer to purchase or acquire any of the Assets
or Membership Interests be made to any Person.

(f) As of the Closing Date, Kemmerer does not have an ownership interest in
any other Person.

(g) The Coal Reserves constitute all of the coal reserves to which Kemmerer
has any rights as of the Closing Date. The real property rights of Kemmerer
in and to the Coal Reserves, together with the Transferred Reserves, shall be
sufficient to enable Kemmerer to mine and/or contract to have mined on a
surface mining basis all of the Coal Reserves without any need for the
acquisition of additional real property rights.

3.6 Legal Proceedings.

 

(a) There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Contributor,
threatened, (i) challenging the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, (ii) otherwise relating to such transactions or the Transaction
Documents or (iii) that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Kemmerer Mining Operation
or the Assets.

(b) Other than with respect to Proceedings arising under Environmental Laws
that are the subject of  _Section 3.8_ or as set forth on _Schedule 3.6(b)_
of the Contributor Disclosure Schedules, there are no Proceedings pending or,
to the Knowledge of Contributor, threatened, against Contributor in relation
to any of the Assets. To the Knowledge of Contributor, no event has occurred
and no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected give rise to, or
serve as a basis for, any such Proceedings.

 



\- 7 - (c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.6(c)_ of the Contributor Disclosure
Schedules, there are (i) no outstanding orders from any Governmental
Authority that adversely affect in any material respect the Kemmerer Mining
Operation or the ability of (A) Kemmerer to use or operate the Assets as they
are currently used and operated or (B) as of the Closing Date, Kemmerer to
own the Assets as they are currently owned and (ii) no unsatisfied judgments,
injunctions, decrees, rulings, penalties or awards against or affecting the
Kemmerer Mining Operation or the Assets.

3.7 Permits.

 

(a) All Permits currently held by Kemmerer relating to the Kemmerer Mining
Operation constitute all Permits necessary for the operation of the Kemmerer
Mining Operation as presently conducted and as proposed to be conducted. As of
the Closing Date, all such Permits are held by Kemmerer. All such Permits that
have been issued are in full force and binding upon Kemmerer and,
to Contributors knowledge, the other parties thereto. There are no
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Contributor, threatened, that seek
the revocation, cancellation, suspension or materially adverse modification of
such Permits. Kemmerer is in compliance in all material respects with all
such Permits. All Permits are renewable by Kemmerer by their terms in the
Ordinary Course of Business without the need to comply with any special
qualification procedures or to pay any amounts other than routine filing
fees. Contributor has not received written notice to the effect that (i)
Kemmerer is not in compliance with, or is in violation of, any Permit, (ii)
any currently existing circumstances are likely to result in a failure of
Kemmerer to comply with, or result in a violation by Kemmerer of, any Permit,
or (iii) any pending Permit application related to the Kemmerer Mining
Operation will be delayed, denied or made subject to any
special qualification procedures or the payment of any amounts other than
routine filing fees.

(b) Neither Contributor nor Kemmerer has been notified in writing or
otherwise by OSMRE or the agency of any state administering SMCRA or any
comparable state statute that Kemmerer or the Kemmerer Mining Operation is:
(i) ineligible to receive additional Permits (i.e., "permit blocked" under
OSMREs Applicant Violator System (AVS)); or (ii) under investigation to
determine whether its eligibility to receive or maintain any such Permits
should be revoked. As of the Closing Date, no facts exist that presently or

comment and approval a copy of the proposed Tax Return no later than thirty
(30) days prior to the filing date of such Tax Return (including extensions
thereof). Contributor and the Partnership shall consult and attempt to resolve
in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such proposed
Tax Returns. If Contributor and the Partnership cannot agree on the amount of
Taxes owed by the Parties or the treatment of an item shown on such Tax Return
within fifteen (15) days, Contributor and the Partnership shall refer
the matter to Deloitte Tax LLP. Contributor and the Partnership shall equally
share the fees and expenses of Deloitte Tax LLP and the determination of
Deloitte Tax LLP as to the amount owing by the Parties with respect to the
proposed Tax Returns shall be binding on both Contributor and the Partnership

(g) For purposes of this  _Section 5.6_, the portion of any Taxes (other
than Taxes allocated pursuant to _Section 5.6(e)_) levied with respect to
Kemmerer or the Assets for any Straddle Period that is allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are either based
upon or related to income or receipt or imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year of Kemmerer
ended with (and include) the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of any other
Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire taxable
period. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends
after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant
taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give
effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with
past practices of the Parties and shall be in conformity with the Code and
any other applicable authorities except to the extent required by any
applicable Law.

7.3 Indemnification Procedure.

 

 __(a) Promptly after any Indemnified Party becomes aware of facts giving rise
to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to  _Section 7.2_, such
Indemnified Party will assert its claim for indemnification under _Section
7.2_ (each, a _"Claim"_ ) by providing a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ")
within the applicable Survival Period to the applicable indemnifying party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") specifying, in reasonable detail, to the extent
known by such Indemnified Party, the nature and basis for such Claim ( __
_e.g._ __, the underlying representation, warranty or covenant alleged to have
been breached and the condition or conduct allegedly resulting in such
breach). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party s delay in
sending a Claim Notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from Liability
hereunder with respect to such Claim except to the extent (and limited solely
to the extent) of any material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party by such
failure or delay, provided that such Claim Notice is provided within the
applicable Survival Period. __

(b) If any Proceeding is instituted or any Claim is asserted by any Third
Party in respect of which indemnification may be sought under _Section 7.2_
and in respect of which the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to
indemnify the Indemnified Party for all of such Indemnified Partys Loss
(subject to any applicable limitations in this _Article VII_) (a _"Third
Party Claim_ " __), the Indemnifying Party will have the right, at such
Indemnifying Party s expense, to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim, including the appointment and selection of counsel on behalf of the
Indemnified Party so long as such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of
any such Third Party Claim, it shall within 30 days after receiving notice of
the Claim notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its intent to do so.
Subject to _Section 7.3(c)_, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
settle or compromise or take any corrective or remedial action with respect to
any such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings
will be diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion
or settled at the discretion of the

 



\- 29 -  Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party will be entitled, at its own cost,
to participate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, unless separate representation of the Indemnified Party by
counsel is reasonably necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case
such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim but
fails to diligently prosecute such Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying
Party does not assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may assume control of such defense and, if the Third
Party Claim is determined to be a matter for which the Indemnifying Party is
required to provide indemnification under the terms of this _Article VII_,
the Indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable costs and expenses of such
defense (including fees and expenses of counsel).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party may not settle, compromise, take any corrective or
remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent decree or permit a
default without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent, in each case,
that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by
the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a binding, irrevocable,
written release of any Indemnified Party from all Liability, (ii) provides for
any admission of Liability on the part of any Indemnified Party, (iii)
requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of any Indemnified
Party or (iv) imposes any Liability or continuing obligation on or could
potentially require any payment from any Indemnified Party.

 

7.4 Limitations.

(a) No Indemnifying Party shall have any Liability under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_
or _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ related to a representation or warranty (other than a
Fundamental Representation and representations made in _Section 3.10_) in
respect of any individual claim involving Loss to any Indemnified Party of
less than $100,000 (each, a " _De Minimis Claim_ "), unless such individual
claim is directly related to one or more other claims that in the
aggregate involve Loss in excess of $100,000, in which case, the Indemnifying
Party will have Liability for the full amount of such claims (subject to the
other limitations contained in this _Section 7.4_) and such claims shall not
be considered  _De Minimis_ Claims (provided, that, notwithstanding anything
in the foregoing to the contrary, solely for the purposes of this _Section
7.4(a)_, all claims related to any fact or circumstance that causes any
representation or warranty made in any particular section of this Agreement
to be inaccurate shall be deemed to be related to all other claims related to
such fact or circumstance).

 

(b) No Partnership Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ related to a representation or warranty
(other than a Fundamental Representation and representations made in _Section
3.10 _or in the case of knowing and intentional fraud) unless the aggregate of
all Loss claimed by the Partnership Indemnified Parties pursuant to such
section that are not _De Minimis_ Claims exceeds 1% of the Reference Amount
(the " _Claim Deductible_ "), in which case, subject to _Section 7.4(d)_,
Contributor shall indemnify the Partnership Indemnified Party only for the
Loss in excess of the Claim Deductible.

(c) No Contributor Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ related to a representation
or warranty (other than a Fundamental Representation and representations made
in _Section 3.10_) unless the aggregate of all Losses claimed by the
Contributor Indemnified Parties pursuant to such section exceed the Claim
Deductible, in which case, subject to _Section 7.4(d)_, the Partnership shall
indemnify the Contributor Indemnified Party only for the Losses in excess of
the Claim Deductible. 

 



\- 30 - (d) Contributor shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Partnership
Indemnified Parties under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ for Losses that exceed, in the
aggregate, 10% of the Reference Amount; provided, however, that such
limitation shall not apply to Losses of the Partnership Indemnified Parties
arising from any Fundamental Representation or the representations made in
_Section 3.10_, or knowing and intentional fraud, and Contributors aggregate
Liability for such Losses, together with any other indemnifiable Losses, shall
not exceed the Reference Amount. The Partnership shall not have any
obligation to indemnify the Contributor Indemnified Parties under _Section
7.2(b)(i)_ for Losses that exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the Reference
Amount; provided, however, that such limitation shall not apply to Losses of
the Contributor Indemnified Parties arising from any Fundamental
Representation, and the Partnerships aggregate Liability for such Losses,
together with any other indemnifiable Losses, shall not exceed the Reference
Amount.

(e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE
PARTNERSHIP, CONTRIBUTOR, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE
HEREUNDER TO ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY (i) PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
OR (ii) LOST PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES EXCEPT, IN
THE CASE OF THIS CLAUSE (ii), TO THE EXTENT SUCH LOST PROFITS OR DAMAGES ARE
(A) NOT BASED ON ANY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTY ENTITLED TO
INDEMNIFICATION AND (B) THE NATURAL, PROBABLE AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE
RESULT OF THE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE THERETO OR THE MATTER FOR WHICH
INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION THROUGH
WHICH SUCH DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT, EXCEPT IN EACH CASE OF THE FOREGOING CLAUSES
(i) AND (ii), TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH LOST PROFITS OR DAMAGES ARE INCLUDED IN
ANY ACTION BY A THIRD PARTY AGAINST SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR WHICH IT IS
ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

7.5 Calculation of Loss. In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified
Party, the amount of any indemnified Loss shall be computed net of (a)
payments actually recovered by any Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy with respect to such Loss net of expenses and (b) any actual recovery
by any Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to such Loss net of
expenses. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue reimbursement for Loss, including under insurance policies and
indemnity arrangements.

7.6 No Duplication. In no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to
recover any Loss under one section or provision of this Agreement to the
extent of the full amount of such Loss already recovered by such Indemnified
Party, nor shall its insurer or indemnitor be entitled to any kind of
subrogation or substitution that would give it the right to make a claim
against the Indemnifying Party.

 



\- 31 - 7.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Contributor and the Partnership
shall treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article VII_ as
adjustments to the Consideration for all Tax purposes, except as made
otherwise required by Law following a final determination made by the United
States Internal Revenue Service or a Governmental Authority with competent
jurisdiction.

ACCORDANCE WITH  _SECTION 10.6_ OR (ii) PURSUE CLAIMS PURSUANT TO OR ARISING
UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED FOR THEREIN.

 

 __(b) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto, each Party, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, covenants, agrees
and acknowledges that (i) no Person other than the Parties shall have any
obligation or Liability hereunder, under any Transaction Document or under

TERMINATION

8.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Contributor and the Partnership;

(b) by Contributor or the Partnership if there shall be in effect a final
nonappealable order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to Contributor,
on the one hand, or the Partnership, on the other hand, if such order was
primarily due to the failure of Contributor, on the one hand, or the
Partnership, on the other hand, to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(c) by the Partnership if Contributor shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Contributor shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section
6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable of
being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 15
days following receipt by Contributor of notice of such breach from the
Partnership;

 



\- 33 - (d) by Contributor if the Partnership shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Partnership shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.3(a)_ or  _6.3(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach is
incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured within 15 days following receipt by the Partnership of notice of such
breach from Contributor; or

 

(e) by Contributor or the Partnership if the Closing does not occur on or
before October 31, 2015 (the " _Outside Date_ "), as such Outside Date may be
amended from time to time with the prior written consent of the Parties;
provided that such failure of the Closing to occur is not due to the failure
of such Party to perform and comply in all material respects with the
covenants and agreements to be performed or complied with by such Party prior
to the Closing.

8.2 Procedure Upon Termination. If a Party is entitled to, and does,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Party terminating the

9.1 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This
Agreement and all questions relating to the interpretation or enforcement of
this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law
of the State of Delaware without regard to the Law of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction that would call for the application of the substantive
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Service of summons,
complaint or other process in connection with any Proceedings contemplated
hereby may be made in accordance with _Section 10.3_ addressed to such Party
at the address specified pursuant to _Section 10.3_. Each Party irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware, or if, but only if, that such court does not have
jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if that such court does not have
jurisdiction over such action or Proceeding, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Delaware Superior Court) (collectively, the " _Courts_ "), for the
purposes of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any Proceeding
relating hereto except in such Courts). Service of any process, summons,
notice or document hand delivered or

 



\- 34 -  sent in accordance with _Section 10.3_ to such Partys respective address

sentence. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby

waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees that a final judgment
in any Proceeding properly brought in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in
any jurisdiction or in any other manner provided at law or in equity. EACH
PARTY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND
ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH.

compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. Whenever an approval, waiver or a material determination or decision
by the Partnership is called for in this Agreement, such approval, waiver,
determination or decision must be authorized by the Conflicts Committee.

10.5 Expenses. Each Party shall pay its own costs and expenses (including
legal, accounting, financial advisory and consulting fees and expenses)
incurred by such Party in connection with the negotiation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. 

10.6 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a breach of
this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to each of the Partnership and
Contributor and neither Party will have an adequate remedy at Law. Therefore,
the obligations of each Party under this Agreement, including Contributors

Partnerships obligation to issue and/or deliver the Contributor Consideration
to Contributor, shall be enforceable by a decree of specific performance
issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive

hereto), together with each of the other Transaction Documents, constitute
the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous
discussions, agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.

10.8 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Law, but if
any provision or portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any Law in any jurisdiction by any
applicable Governmental Authority, (a) such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of
any other provision of this Agreement in such jurisdiction or affect the
validity, legality or enforceability of any provision in any other
jurisdiction, (b) such provision shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
only to the extent strictly required by such Governmental Authority, (c) to
the extent any such provision is deemed to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, Contributor and the Partnership each agree that it shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Governmental Authority to
modify such provision so that such provision shall be valid, legal and
enforceable as originally intended to the greatest extent possible and (d) to
the extent that the Governmental Authority does not modify such provision,
Contributor and the Partnership each agree that they shall endeavor in good
faith to exercise or modify such provision so that such provision shall be
valid, legal and enforceable as originally intended to the greatest extent
possible.

10.9 Disclosure Schedules. The inclusion of any information (including dollar
amounts) in any section of the Contributor Disclosure Schedules or the
Partnership Entities Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment by a Party that such information is required to
be listed on such section of the Contributor Disclosure Schedules or the
Partnership Entities Disclosure Schedules or is material to or outside the
ordinary course of the business of such Party or the Person to which such
disclosure relates. The information contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits
and the Schedules is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits or the Schedules shall
be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third Person of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of a legal requirement or breach of
contract). The disclosure contained in one disclosure schedule contained in
the Contributor Disclosure Schedules or the Partnership Entities Disclosure
Schedules may be incorporated by reference into any other disclosure schedule
contained therein, and shall be deemed to have been so incorporated into any
other disclosure schedule so long as it is readily apparent that the
disclosure is applicable to such other disclosure schedule.

10.10 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of
or enforceable by any Third Person, including any creditor of any Party or

claim in respect of any liability (or otherwise) against any Party. 

 



\- 37 - 10.11 Facsimiles; Electronic Transmission; Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed by facsimile or other electronic transmission (including scanned
documents delivered by email) by any Party and such execution shall be deemed
binding for all purposes hereof, without delivery of an original signature
being thereafter required. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which together shall constitute one and the same document.

 

10.12 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance of this
Agreement.

 

10.13 Right to Rely. Following the Closing, any rights to indemnification,
payment, reimbursement or other remedy based on representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto shall not be affected by any investigation conducted at any
time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) before the
Closing. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or in the performance of or compliance with, any
such covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification,
payment, reimbursement, or any other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements.
