(a) The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and subject to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the
Closing, Acquiror and the Company shall cause Merger Sub to be merged with and
into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub

   "Certificate of Merger") in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. The time of such filing and acceptance by the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or such other later time as may be agreed in writing
by Acquiror and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, is
referred to herein as the "Effective Time." The Company, as the surviving
corporation of the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving

(b) The Surviving Corporation of the Merger.

  

  

(i) Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

  

  

(A) Certificate of Incorporation. Unless otherwise determined by Acquiror
prior to the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be
identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of
incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is
LiveRamp, Inc."

  

  

(B) Bylaws. Unless otherwise determined by Acquiror prior to the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

  

  

(ii) Directors and Officers.

  

  

(A) Directors. Unless otherwise determined by Acquiror prior to the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold the office of a director of the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until his
or her successors is duly elected and qualified.

  

  

(B) Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Acquiror prior to the Effective
Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall

Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

1.3 Effects of the Merger on Securities of Merging Corporations.

-2-  

  

 

  value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001

evidencing ownership of any such shares shall thereupon evidence ownership
only of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  

  

(b) Company Capital Stock.

  

  

(i) Generally. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the Stockholders or
any other Person, each share of Company Capital Stock (excluding (A) Cancelled
Shares, which shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 1.3(b)(ii),
and (B) Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated in the manner set forth in
Section 1.3(b)(iii)) that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the
right to receive the Per Share Consideration upon the terms set forth in this
Section 1.3 and throughout this Agreement (including the escrow holdback set
forth in Section 2.3(b)(ii) and Article IX and the Representative Expense Fund
holdback set forth in Section 2.3(b)(iii)) and surrender of the Company Stock
Certificate in respect thereof and the Exchange Documents all in the manner
provided in Section 2.3(c). Until so surrendered, each Company Stock
Certificate that is outstanding after the Effective Time shall be deemed, for
all purposes after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive
the Per Share Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 1.3(b)(i). For
purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Per Share Consideration
payable to each Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.3(b)(i), (x) all shares
of the Company Capital Stock held by each such Stockholder shall be aggregated
on a certificate-by-certificate basis and (y) the amount of cash to be paid to
each Stockholder for each Company share certificate held by such Stockholder
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

  

  

(ii) Cancelled Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company, the Stockholders or
any other Person, each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and
outstanding and held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Cancelled Shares") shall be
cancelled without any consideration paid therefor.

  

  

(iii) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which the holder
thereof has properly demanded appraisal rights or dissenters' rights in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of
California Law, and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's
appraisal rights under Delaware Law or, if applicable, California Law
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital
Stock set forth in Section 1.3(b)(i), but the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law or, if applicable,
California Law. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3(b)(iii), if
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights under Delaware
Law or, if applicable, California Law, then, as of the later of the Effective
Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
consideration for Company Capital Stock, as applicable, set forth in Section
1.3(b)(i), without interest thereon, and subject to the escrow provisions set
forth in Article IX and the Representative Expense Fund holdback set forth in
Section 2.3(b)(iii), upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares. The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law or, if applicable, California Law. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

  consent of Acquiror, make any payment with respect to any such demands or
offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any communication to be made by
the Company to any Stockholder with respect to such demands shall be submitted
to Acquiror in advance and shall not be presented to any Stockholder prior to
the Company receiving Acquiror's prior written consent.

 

  

  

(c) Company Options.

  

  

(i) Vested Company Options. Effective as of the Effective Time, each Vested
Company Option shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share
subject thereto, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Consideration
for each share of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of
such Vested Company Option over the per share exercise price of such Vested
Company Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Company
Option Cash Out Amount"), upon the terms set forth in this Section 1.3 and
throughout this Agreement (including the escrow holdback set forth in Section
2.3(b)(ii) and Article IX and the Representative Expense Fund holdback set
forth in Section 2.3(b)(iii)), and each such Vested Company Option shall
terminate at the Effective Time. The payment of the Company Option Cash Out
Amount to any holder of Vested Company Options shall be reduced by any income
or employment Tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of
applicable state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entities, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of
such Vested Company Options.

  

  

(ii) Unvested Company Options.

  

 

 

  

(A) Held by Continuing Employees. Effective as of the Effective Time, each
Unvested Company Option that is held by a Continuing Employee and is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
Acquiror as an Acquiror Option. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement or in a Key Employee Offer Letter, each such Company Option so
assumed by Acquiror pursuant to this Section 1.3(c)(ii) shall continue to
have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions
(including vesting terms) set forth in the Plan and the option agreements
relating thereto, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that (x) such assumed Company Option shall be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock and (y) the per share exercise price for the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such assumed Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
exercise price of the option, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to
such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall in
all events be determined in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the
Code, and in the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, Section
424 of the Code.

  

  

(B) Held by Non-Continuing Employees. Effective as of the Effective Time, each
Unvested Company Option that is held by a Non-Continuing Employee and is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger, be immediately cancelled without any consideration therefor.

  

  

(iii) Necessary Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the prior
review and approval of Acquiror, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to effect the transactions anticipated by this

  

  

 

  

 

-4-  

  

 

  Section 1.3(c) under the Plan and any Contract applicable to any Company
Option (whether written or oral, formal or informal), including the
determination by the administrator of the Plan that the treatment of Company
Options as contemplated by this Section 1.3(c) is permissible under the terms
of the Plan and the applicable equity award agreements, delivering all
required notices, obtaining all necessary approvals and consents, and
delivering evidence satisfactory to Acquiror that all necessary determinations
by the Company's Board of Directors or applicable committee of the Company's
Board of Directors to cash out, terminate or provide for the assumption of all
Company Options in accordance with this Section 1.3(c)(iii) have been made.

 

  

  

(iv) No Acceleration. Except as set forth in Schedule 1.3(c)(iv), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not resolve to accelerate the vesting of any
Company Options. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall take
all actions necessary (including requiring Key Employees to re-vest or extend
the vesting period on their Company Options) to ensure that as of the Closing,
each of the Key Employees has a number of Unvested Company Options equal to no
less than fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate number of Company Capital
Stock and Company Options held by such Key Employee and that such Unvested
Company Options have no less than twenty-four (24) months remaining in their
vesting period.

  

  

(v) S-8 Registration. Within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date,
Acquiror shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8, if
available for use by Acquiror, registering that number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of all Company Options that are assumed by Acquiror pursuant
to Section 1.3(c) that are eligible to be registered on Form S-8.

  

  

1.4 Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Pre-Closing WC Statement. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Acquiror a statement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror (the "Pre-Closing WC Statement") setting
forth in reasonable detail the Company's good faith estimate of Closing
Working Capital (including all components thereof), accompanied by reasonably
detailed back-up documentation for such calculation and any additional
information reasonably requested by Acquiror. The Company shall prepare the
Pre-Closing WC Statement using the same accounting principles, practices,
procedures, policies and methods, with consistent classifications, judgments,
inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies that were
employed in the preparation of Sample Working Capital Statement. The Company
shall give Acquiror a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on a draft
of the Pre-Closing WC Statement prior to the Closing Date, and shall take in
consideration in good faith any comments of Acquiror on the Pre-Closing WC
Statement.

  

  

(b) Post-Closing WC Statement. As promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date (the "Acquiror
Review Period"), Acquiror shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared
and delivered, to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the "Post-
Closing WC Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Acquiror's good
faith calculation of Closing Working Capital (including all components
thereof), accompanied by reasonably detailed back-up documentation for such
calculation and any additional information reasonably requested by the
Stockholder Representative. Acquiror shall prepare the Post-Closing WC
Statement using the same accounting principles, practices, procedures,
policies and methods, with consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions,
exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies that were employed in
the preparation of Sample Working Capital Statement. If Acquiror fails to
deliver the Post-Closing WC Statement within the Acquiror Review Period, the
Pre-Closing WC Statement delivered by the Company at Closing shall be final
and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-5-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Review of Post-Closing WC Statement. The Stockholder Representative shall
have sixty (60) calendar days following its receipt of the Post-Closing WC
Statement (the "Review Period") to review the Post-Closing WC Statement,
together with information provided in accordance with this Section 1.4(c)
(which shall be promptly provided by the Stockholder Representative). The
Stockholder Representative shall be granted access during business hours to
the books, records and accounting work papers of the Company to the extent
reasonably necessary to conduct its review, and the Acquiror shall use
reasonable best efforts as practicable to respond promptly, in good faith and
as fully and accurately as is reasonably possible to inquiries from the
Stockholder Representative related to such review. Acquiror will use
reasonable best efforts to provide access to the books and records of the
Company electronically, to the extent such books and records were in an
electronic format prior to the Closing, and shall transmit financial
statements, general journals and trial balances of the Company and its
subsidiaries in formats such as Excel spreadsheets, or searchable Word or pdf
documents, to the extent such information was stored in such formats prior to
the Closing. On or before the expiration of the Review Period, the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver to Acquiror a written statement accepting or
disputing the Post-Closing WC Statement. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative shall dispute the Post-Closing WC Statement, such statement
shall include a detailed itemization of the Stockholder Representative's
objections and the reasons therefor (such statement, a "Dispute Statement").
Any component of the Post-Closing WC Statement that is not disputed in a
Dispute Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and not
subject to appeal. If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver a
Dispute Statement to Acquiror within the Review Period or delivers a statement
accepting the Post-Closing WC Statement, the Post-Closing WC Statement shall
be final and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal.

  

  

(d) Dispute Resolution. If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Dispute
Statement during the Review Period, Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute
Statement during the thirty (30) calendar days immediately following the
Stockholder Representative's receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer
period as Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative may mutually agree (the
"Resolution Period"). Any such disputed items that are resolved by Acquiror
and the Stockholder Representative during the Resolution Period shall be final
and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. If Acquiror and
the Stockholder Representative do not resolve all such disputed items by the
end of the Resolution Period, Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative
shall submit all items remaining in dispute with respect to the Dispute
Statement to KPMG LLP or any other nationally recognized independent
accounting firm upon which Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall
reasonably agree (the "Accounting Firm") for review and resolution. The
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting
Firm shall make all calculations in accordance with the practices used in
preparation of the Post-Closing WC Statement, shall determine only those items
remaining in dispute between Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative, and
shall only be permitted or authorized to determine an amount with respect to
any such disputed item that is either the amount of such disputed item as
proposed by Acquiror in the Post-Closing WC Statement or the amount of such
disputed item as proposed by the Stockholder Representative in the Dispute
Statement. Each of Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall (i) enter
into a customary engagement letter with the Accounting Firm at the time such
dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm and otherwise cooperate with the
Accounting Firm, (ii) have the opportunity to submit a written statement in
support of their respective positions with respect to such disputed items, to
provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in defense of their
respective positions with respect to such disputed items and to submit a
written statement responding to the other party's position with respect to
such disputed items and (iii) subject to customary confidentiality and
indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their
respective books, records, personnel and representatives and such other
information as the Accounting Firm may require in order to render its
determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to Acquiror
and the Stockholder Representative a written determination (such determination
to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in
arriving at such

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-6-  

  

 

  determination and to be based solely on information provided to the
Accounting Firm by Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative) of the
disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the disputed
items, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto
and not subject to appeal. Fifty percent (50%) of any expenses relating to the
engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by Acquiror and fifty percent
50% of such expenses shall be paid by the Stockholder Representative.

 

  

  

(e) Post-Closing Payments.

  

  

(i) If the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.4 exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital as set forth on the
Pre-Closing WC Statement, then Acquiror shall deposit or shall cause to be
deposited with the Payment Agent as soon as practicable, but no later than
three (3) Business Days after such final determination of the Closing Working
Capital, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash
equal to the amount of such excess, which shall be payable to Stockholders and
holders of Vested Company Options in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions.

  

  

(ii) If the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.4 is less than the Estimated Closing Working Capital as set forth on
the Pre-Closing WC Statement, then Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative
shall, as soon as practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days after
such final determination of the Closing Working Capital, provide a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver an amount in cash equal to
the amount of such deficit from the Escrow Fund, which shall be deducted from
Stockholders and holders of Vested Company Options in accordance with their
Pro Rata Portions. For avoidance of doubt, any recovery of any such deficit
from the Escrow Fund shall not be subject to any of limitations on
indemnification set forth in Section 9.3.

  

  

(f) Any payment made under this Section 1.4, to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable Law, shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the Total Consideration.

  

  

1.5 Further Action. If at any time from and after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, Acquiror, Merger Sub, and the officers and directors of the
Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub, are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful
and necessary action.

this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as earned by Acquiror. The

original certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock (a "Company
Stock Certificate"), Acquiror shall cause the Payment Agent to pay to the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereto pursuant to Section 1.3(b)(i) (less
the cash amounts to be withheld and deposited in the Escrow Fund and the
Representative Expense Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Sections
2.3(b)(ii) and 2.3(b)(iii), respectively), and the Company Stock Certificate
so surrendered shall be cancelled. No portion of the Merger Consideration

the holder of record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such
Company Stock Certificate and validly executed Exchange Documents in
accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall

making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.3; provided, however, that
Acquiror may, in its discretion, or as required by the Payment Agent, and as a

surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Acquiror or any agent designated by it any Transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment of any portion of the Total Consideration in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Acquiror or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) Payment Agent to Return Merger Consideration. At any time following the
last day of the sixth month following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall be
entitled to require the Payment Agent to deliver to Acquiror or its designated
successor or assign all cash amounts that have been deposited with the Payment
Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i), and any and all interest thereon or other
income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company Stock
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.3(c), and thereafter the holders of Company
Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Acquiror (subject to the
terms of Section 2.3(h)) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
and all cash amounts that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock
Certificates pursuant to Section 1.3 upon the due surrender of such Company
Stock Certificates and duly executed Exchange Documents in the manner set
forth in Section 2.3(c). No interest shall be payable for the cash amounts
delivered to Acquiror pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.3(f) and
which are subsequently delivered to the holders of Company Stock Certificates.

  

  

(g) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The cash amounts
paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to be
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article I.

  

  

(h) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.3, none of Acquiror, the Payment Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor any
party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

  

  

2.4 Withholding Taxes. The Company, the Payment Agent, the Escrow Agent,
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any provision of federal, local or foreign Tax Laws and shall
be provided any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate
series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, and paid over to the proper
Governmental Entities, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. To the extent that such amounts are not so deducted
and withheld, such Person shall indemnify the Company, the Payment Agent, the
Escrow Agent, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation for any amounts imposed
by a Governmental Entity, together with any related Losses, except to the
extent such related Losses are attributable to Company's, the Payment Agent's,
the Escrow Agent's, Acquiror's or the Surviving Corporation's, as the case may
be, gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

  

  

2.5 Outstanding Loans. In the event that any Person entitled to consideration
hereunder has outstanding loans from the Company or any Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time, the consideration payable to such Person pursuant to Section
1.3 shall be reduced by an amount equal to the outstanding principal plus
accrued interest, if any, of such Person's loans as of the Effective Time,
plus any other amounts owed by such Person to the Company or any Subsidiary
(collectively, such Person's "Loan Repayment Amount"). Such loans shall be
satisfied as to the amount by which the consideration is reduced pursuant to
this Section 2.5. To the extent the consideration payable to such Person is so
reduced, such amount shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person.

has been granted with an exercise price less than the fair market value of a
share of Company Common Stock on the date of grant. The terms of the Plan and
the applicable agreements for each Company Option permit the assumption or
substitution of options to purchase Acquiror Common Stock and the termination
of Company Options as provided in this Agreement, without the consent or

from capital or voting stock of the Company, are issued or outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement.

are no options, warrants, calls, rights, convertible securities, commitments
or agreements of any character, written or oral, to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party or obligating the Company to issue, deliver, sell,
repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or
redeemed, any shares of the capital stock of the Company or obligating the
Company to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change the price of,

Neither the operation of the Company or any Subsidiary on the Leased Real

building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such property or
operations thereon.

or infringement of any Company Registered IP or Company Domain Names; and (iv)
any actions (other than actions that arise from PTO office actions issued
after the Closing Date) that must be taken by the Company within one-hundred
and eighty (180) days of the Closing Date with respect to the Company
Registered IP, including the payment of any registration, maintenance or
renewal fees or the filing of any documents, applications or certificates. To

any Company Registered IP that that would constitute fraud or inequitable
conduct or any other act, in each case that would otherwise affect the
enforceability thereof. All necessary registration, maintenance and renewal
fees in connection with Company Registered IP that are or will be due for
payment on or before the Closing Date have been or will be timely paid and all

any non-exclusive license of Company IP or Company Technology granted in the
ordinary course of business. No Company IP or Company Technology is subject to

stipulation, or Lien, other than any license of Company IP or Company
Technology granted in the ordinary course of business, that restricts in any
manner the use, transfer or licensing thereof by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or may affect the validity, use, or enforceability of such
Company IP or Company Technology. All Company IP that is registered is,
enforceable and, to the Knowledge of Company, valid, and there are no facts or
circumstances that would render any such Company IP unenforceable or, to the
Knowledge of Company, invalid. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has the
sole and exclusive right to bring a claim or suit against a third party for
infringement or misappropriation of the Company IP and Company Technology.

agency during the last three (3) years relating to any Company Employee Plan,
(viii) all policies pertaining to fiduciary liability insurance covering the
fiduciaries for each Company Employee Plan, (ix) all nondiscrimination test
reports and summaries for each Company Employee Plan for the three most recent

advisory letter issued and all applications and correspondence with the IRS

Company Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code. The Company shall use its commercial best efforts to make available
to Acquiror the Company Employee Plan documents set forth on Section 3.16(b)
of the Disclosure Schedule no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
Closing.

  

  

(c) Employee Plan Compliance. The Company and each of its ERISA Affiliates
has, in all material respects, performed all material obligations required to
be performed by them under, is not in material default or material violation
of, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has no Knowledge of any
material default or material violation by any other party to, any Company
Employee Plan, and each Company Employee Plan has been established and
maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in
compliance with all applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules and regulations,
including ERISA or the Code. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (i) is the subject of an unrevoked
favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to such Company
Employee Plan's qualified status under the Code, which determination letter
covers all Tax Law changes for which such a determination letter may be
sought, (ii) has a timely filed request for such a letter pending with the IRS
or has remaining a period of time under the Code or applicable Treasury
Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to request, and make any amendments
necessary to obtain, such a letter from the IRS, or (iii) is a prototype or
volume submitter plan entitled, under applicable IRS guidance, to rely on the
favorable opinion or advisory letter issued by the IRS to the sponsor of such
prototype or volume submitter plan. For each Company Employee Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code there has been no
event, condition or circumstance that has adversely affected or is likely to
adversely affect such qualified status. None of the Company, any Subsidiary
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other Person has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, that is not otherwise exempt under Section 408
of ERISA and that would result in a material liability to the Company or any
Subsidiary, with respect to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-35-  

  

 

  any Company Employee Plan. There are no actions, suits or claims pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated
(other than routine claims for benefits) against any Company Employee Plan or
against the assets of any Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan
can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time
in accordance with its terms, without liability to Acquiror, the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate (other than ordinary administration and termination
expenses and benefits that were earned, vested or accrued under such Company
Employee Plan as of the date of such amendment, termination or
discontinuance). There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by the IRS, DOL, or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any material penalty or material
Tax with respect to any Company Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or
Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code. Except as would not result in a
material liability to the Company or any Subsidiary, the Company and each of
its ERISA Affiliates have timely made all contributions and other payments
required by and due under the terms of each Company Employee Plan. There does
not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be
expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a
liability of the Company or any or Subsidiary at the Effective Time.

 

  

  

(d) No Pension or Funded Welfare Plan, MEWA and Certain Other Company Employee
Plans. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in, contributed to, or agreed to
contribute to, or otherwise be part of (i) any Pension Plan subject to Part 3
of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code; (ii) any "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the
Code; (iii) any multiple employer welfare arrangement, as defined under
Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA (without regard to Section 514(b)(6)(B) of ERISA);
(iv) any multiemployer plan (as defined in Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA); (v) any multiple employer plan or plan described in Section 413(c) of
the Code; or (vi) any self-funded "group health plan," as defined in Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code, including any such plan pursuant to which a stop-loss
policy or contract applies, but excluding any (1) Code Section 125, 127 or 129
plan or (2) any health care flexible spending account plan or arrangement; or
(vii) any "split dollar" life insurance.

  

  

(e) International Employee Plan. Each International Employee Plan has been
established, maintained and administered in all material respects in
compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed
by any and all statutory or regulatory laws that are applicable to such
International Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has
unfunded liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by
insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by applicable Law, no condition
exists that would prevent the Company (or an ERISA Affiliate, as applicable),
the Surviving Corporation (or its relevant subsidiary) or Acquiror from
terminating or amending any International Employee Plan in accordance with its
terms without liability to the Company or its ERISA Affiliates (other than
ordinary administration and termination expenses and benefits earned, vested
or accrued under such International Employee Plan as of the date of such
termination or amendment). To the extent applicable, each International
Employee Plan has been approved by the relevant taxation and other
Governmental Entities so as to enable: (i) the Company and the participants
and beneficiaries under the relevant International Employee Plan and (ii) in
the case of any International Employee Plan under which resources are set
aside in advance of the benefits being paid (a "Funded International Employee
Plan"), the assets held for the purposes of the Funded International Employee
Plans, to enjoy the most favorable taxation status possible and the Company is
not aware of any reasonable ground on which such approval may cease to apply.

  

  

(f) No Post-Employment Obligations. No Company Employee Plan or Employee
Agreement provides, or reflects or represents any liability to provide, post-
termination or retiree or post-employment life insurance, health or other
employee welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except (i) as may be
required by applicable Law, including, without limitation, COBRA, (ii)
benefits through the end of the month of termination of employment, (iii)

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-36-  

  

 

  death benefits attributable to deaths occurring at or prior to termination
of employment, (iv) disability benefits attributable to disabilities occurring
at or prior to termination of employment and (v) conversion rights, and
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever represented, promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Employee (either
individually or to Employees as a group) or any other person that such
Employee(s) or other person would be provided with post-termination or retiree
or post-employment life insurance, health or other employee welfare benefits,
except (i) to the extent required by applicable Law, including, without
limitation, COBRA, (ii) benefits through the end of the month of termination
of employment, (iii) death benefits attributable to deaths occurring at or
prior to termination of employment, (iv) disability benefits attributable to
disabilities occurring at or prior to termination of employment and (v)
conversion rights.

 

  

  

(g) Effect of Transaction. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (alone
or in connection with additional or subsequent events) or any termination of
employment or service in connection therewith will (i) result in any payment
(including severance, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise), becoming due to
any Employee except as provided by this Agreement, (ii) result in any
forgiveness of indebtedness, (iii) increase any benefits otherwise payable by
the Company or any Subsidiary or (iv) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such benefits except as required under Section
411(d)(3) of the Code.

  

  

(h) Health Care Compliance. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate has complied
in all material respects with COBRA, CFRA, FMLA, HIPAA, the Women's Health and
Cancer Rights Act of 1998, the Trade Act of 2002, the Newborns' and Mothers'
Health Protection Act of 1996, Medicare Part D, the TAA Health Coverage
Improvement Act of 2009, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,
the Public Health Services Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, each as amended,
and any similar provisions of state law, as applicable to its Employees.

  

  

3.17 Employment Matters.

  

  

(a) Compliance with Employment Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is in material compliance with all applicable foreign, federal, state and
local laws, rules and regulations respecting employment, employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment, worker classification, tax withholding,
prohibited discrimination, equal employment, fair employment practices, meal
and rest periods, immigration status, employee safety and health, wages
(including overtime wages), compensation, and hours of work, and in each case,
with respect to Employees: (i) has withheld and reported in all material
respects all amounts required by law or by agreement to be withheld and
reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to Employees, (ii)
is not liable for any material arrears of wages, severance pay or any Taxes or
any penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing, and (iii) is not
liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by
or on behalf of any governmental authority, with respect to unemployment
compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for
Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practice). There are no actions, suits,
claims or administrative matters pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated
against the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, or any of their Employees relating
to any Employee, Employee Agreement or Company Employee Plan. There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably
anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits and appeals of such
claims) or actions against Company, any ERISA Affiliate, any Company trustee
or any trustee of any Subsidiary under any worker's compensation policy or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-37-  

  

 

  long-term disability policy. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
is party to a conciliation agreement, consent decree or other agreement or
order with any Governmental Entity with respect to employment practices. The
services provided by each of the Company's and their ERISA Affiliates'
Employees are terminable at the will of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates
and any such termination would result in no liability to the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate (other than ordinary administration expenses or with respect
to benefits that were previously earned, vested or accrued under Company
Employee Plans prior to such termination). Section 3.17(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule lists all liabilities of the Company to any Employee, that result
from the termination by the Company, Acquiror or any Subsidiary of such
Employee's employment or provision of services, other than those disclosed in
Section 3.16(g). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has direct or
indirect liability with respect to any misclassification of (a) any person as
an independent contractor rather than as an employee, (b) any employee leased
from another employer or (c) any employee currently or formerly classified as
exempt from overtime wages.

 

  

  

(b) Labor. No strike, labor dispute, slowdown, concerted refusal to work
overtime, or work stoppage or labor strike against the Company or any

reasonably anticipated. The Company has no Knowledge of any activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any Employees. There are no
Actions, labor disputes or grievances pending or threatened or reasonably
anticipated relating to any labor matters involving any Employee, including
charges of unfair labor practices. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act or similar Law. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any
collective bargaining agreement, works council, union or similar Contract with
respect to Employees and no such agreement is being negotiated by the Company
or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any action
which would constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" within the meaning
of the WARN Act or similar state or local law, issued any notification of a
plant closing or mass layoff required by the WARN Act or similar state or
local law, or incurred any liability or obligation under WARN or any similar
state or local law that remains unsatisfied. No terminations prior to the
Closing would trigger any notice or other obligations under the WARN Act or
similar state or local law.

  

  

(c) No Interference or Conflict. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
stockholder, director, officer, Employee or consultant of the Company or any
Subsidiary is obligated under any Contract, subject to any judgment, decree,
or order of any court or administrative agency that would interfere with such
person's efforts to promote the interests of the Company or any Subsidiary or
that would interfere with the Company's business. Neither the execution nor
delivery of this Agreement, nor the carrying on of the Company's business as
presently conducted or proposed to be conducted nor any activity of such
officers, directors, Employees or consultants in connection with the carrying
on of the Company's business or any Subsidiary's businesses as presently
conducted or currently proposed to be conducted will, to the Knowledge of the
Company, conflict with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions, or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, any Contract under which any of
such officers, directors, Employees, or consultants is now bound.

  

  

3.18 Governmental Authorizations. Each consent, license, permit, grant or
other authorization (a) pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary
currently operates or holds any interest in any of their respective
properties, or (b) which is required for the operation of the Company's or any
Subsidiary's business as currently conducted or the holding of any such
interest (collectively, "Company Authorizations") has been issued or granted
to the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be. The Company
Authorizations are in full force and effect and constitute all Company
Authorizations required to permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to operate
or conduct their respective businesses or hold any interest in their
respective properties. The Company has been and is in compliance with the
terms and conditions of the Company Authorizations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-38-  

  

 

 

 

  

3.19 Litigation. There is no Action of any nature pending, or to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened, against the Company, any Subsidiary, their
respective properties and assets (tangible or intangible) or any of their
respective officers or directors (in their capacities as such), nor is there
any reasonable basis therefor. No Governmental Entity has at any time
challenged or, to the Knowledge of the Company, questioned the legal right of
the Company or any Subsidiary to conduct their respective operations as
presently or previously conducted. There is no Action of any nature pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against any Person who has a
contractual right or a right pursuant to Delaware Law to indemnification from
the Company related to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Effective
Time, nor is there any reasonable basis therefor.

  

  

3.20 Insurance. Section 3.20 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all insurance
policies and fidelity bonds covering the assets, business, equipment,
properties, operations, employees, officers and directors of the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate, including the type of coverage, the carrier, the amount
of coverage, the term and the annual premiums of such policies. There is no
claim by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate pending under any of such policies
or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed or that
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has a reason to believe will be denied or
disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds. In addition, there is
no pending claim of which its total value (inclusive of defense expenses)
would reasonably be expected to exceed the policy limits. All premiums due and
payable under all such policies and bonds have been paid (or if installment
payments are due, will be paid if incurred prior to the Closing Date) and the
Company and its ERISA Affiliates are otherwise in material compliance with the
terms of such policies and bonds (or other policies and bonds providing
substantially similar insurance coverage). Such policies and bonds are in full
force and effect. The Company does not have any Knowledge or reasonable belief
of threatened termination of, or premium increase with respect to, any of such
policies. None of the Company nor any Affiliate of either has ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any self-insurance
plan.

  

  

3.21 Compliance with Laws.

associated with or acting on their behalf) has, directly or indirectly, taken
any action which would cause it to be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any rules or regulations thereunder or
any similar anti-corruption or anti-bribery Laws applicable to the Company or
to the

at all times until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1, the

posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of
this Article VI and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which Acquiror may be entitled
at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any

ARTICLE VII

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

7.1 Stockholder Approvals.

  

  

(a) Requisite Stockholder Approval. Immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall solicit written consent from all of its
Stockholders in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Stockholder
Written Consent"). The Company shall promptly deliver to Acquiror a copy of
each executed Stockholder Written Consent upon receipt thereof from any
Stockholder pursuant to such solicitation. Within 30 minutes after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to Acquiror Stockholder
Written Consents from Stockholders pursuant to the preceding solicitation and
will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that such Stockholder Written
Consents are sufficient to fully and irrevocably deliver the Requisite
Stockholder Approval. Upon receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Company shall promptly deliver notice (the "Stockholder Notice") to each
Stockholder whose consent was not obtained prior to the Company's receipt of
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, which notice shall include the notice to
stockholders required by Section 262 of Delaware Law of the approval of the
Merger and that appraisal rights are available. Such Stockholder Notice shall
be subject to Acquiror's reasonable review and comments. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall not alter, modify, change or revoke its
unanimous approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, nor its unanimous recommendation to the Stockholders to
vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) 280G Approvals. The Company shall obtain waivers by any "disqualified
individuals" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code of any payments
and/or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (which determination shall be made by the Company and
shall be subject to review and approval by Acquiror) ("Section 280G Payments")
and, promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall submit to the
Stockholders for approval (in a form and manner reasonably satisfactory to
Acquiror), by such number of Stockholders as is required by the terms of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code such that such Section 280G Payments shall
not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code. Prior
to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Acquiror evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror that (i) a Stockholder vote was solicited
in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder
and the requisite Stockholder approval was

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-47-  

  

 

  obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to
the Stockholder vote (the "280G Approval"), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was
not obtained and as a consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be
made or provided, pursuant to a 280G waiver, each in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit E (the "280G Waiver"), entered into by each Person who otherwise
might receive any payments and/or benefits in connection with the Merger that
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
that waived any right or entitlement to such payments and/or benefits so that
such payment and benefits do not constitute "parachute payments" thereunder.

 

  

  

7.2 Governmental Approvals.

  

  

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of Section 7.4, each of
the Company, any Subsidiary and Acquiror shall promptly execute and file, or
join in the execution and filing of, any application, notification or other
document that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval
or consent of any Governmental Entity, whether federal, state, local or
foreign, that may be reasonably required, or that Acquiror may reasonably
request, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain all such authorizations, approvals and consents. To the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, each of the Company and Acquiror shall promptly
inform the other of any material communication between the Company or Acquiror
(as applicable) and any Governmental Entity regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby. If the Company or Acquiror or any Affiliate thereof shall
receive any formal or informal request for supplemental information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, then the Company or Acquiror (as applicable)
shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a response
in compliance with such request. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall
direct, in its sole discretion, the making of such response, but shall
consider in good faith the views of the other.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Acquiror,
the Company nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to litigate any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding that may be brought in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither
Acquiror, the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required
to agree to any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), of shares of capital
stock or of any business, assets or property of Acquiror, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates, or the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise
control of such assets, properties and stock.

  

  

(c) Acquiror shall, in consultation with the Company and subject to Section
7.2(b), determine strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate all activities
with respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any
Governmental Entity as contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Acquiror
shall direct, in its sole discretion, the taking of such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers, but shall consider in good faith the views of the other.
Notwithstanding Acquiror's rights to lead all proceedings as provided in the
prior sentence, Acquiror shall not require the Company to, and the Company
shall not be required to, take any action with respect to any applicable
antitrust or anti-competition Law which would bind the Company or its
Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Merger occurs.

  

  

7.3 Third Party Contracts.

  

  

(a) Notices and Consents. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any third parties to
any Contract (including all of the Contracts set forth in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-48-  

  

 

  Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Schedule) as are required thereunder in
connection with the Merger in order for such Contract to remain in full force
and effect following the Merger. Such consents, modifications, waivers and
approvals shall be in a form acceptable to Acquiror. In the event the Merger
does not close for any reason, neither Acquiror nor Merger Sub shall have any
liability to the Company, the Stockholders or any other Person for any costs,
claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain
such consents, modifications, waivers and approvals.

 

  

  

(b) Released Agreements. The Company Acquiror shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that any obligations of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries under the Contracts set forth on Schedule 7.3(b) (the
"Released Agreements") have been satisfied prior to the Closing and the
counterparty to such Contracts have executed a release releasing the Company
and its Subsidiaries from any further obligations under such Contracts. The
form and substance of each release agreement shall be subject to prior review
and approval by Acquiror. Upon the Closing, the Company shall have paid all
amounts owed under the Released Agreements (as a result of the Released
Agreements or otherwise), and the Company will not incur any claim, liability
or obligation (absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or
otherwise) under any Released Agreements following the Closing Date. The
Company shall be responsible for making any payments required to obtain
releases for the Released Agreements and shall reflect such payment or other
consideration incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date or anticipated to
be incurred or payable after the Closing in the Statement of Expenses. In the
event the Merger does not close for any reason, neither Acquiror nor Merger
Sub shall have any liability to the Company, the Stockholders or any other
Person for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the
Company seeking to obtain such releases.

  

  

7.4 Reasonable Efforts to Close. Subject to the terms and conditions provided
in this Agreement (including Section 7.2(b)), each of the parties hereto shall
use reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly,
all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable, including by using reasonable best efforts to take
all action necessary to satisfy all of the conditions to the obligations of
the other party or parties hereto to effect the Merger set forth in Article
VII, to obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals and other documents
required to be delivered hereunder and to effect all necessary registrations
and filings and to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays,
legal or otherwise, in each case in order to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the
purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

7.5 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Tax Returns. Acquiror shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and each Subsidiary
required to be filed after the Closing Date, and shall timely remit, or cause
to be remitted, to the appropriate Governmental Entity all Taxes reflected on
such Tax Returns, subject to Acquiror's right to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(ix). To the extent such Tax Returns include any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Law
and consistent with the past practices of the Company and its subsidiaries in
all material respects, except to the extent necessary in Acquiror's reasonable
good faith judgment to comply with applicable Law. Not later than thirty (30)
days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return that is an income
Tax Return and not later than ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing
any such material Tax Return that is not an income Tax Return, Acquiror shall
deliver or cause to be delivered a copy of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation and workpapers, to the Stockholder Representative for
the Stockholder Representative's review and comment. Acquiror shall reasonably
and in good faith consider comments of the Stockholder Representative and
shall provide a copy of any such Tax Return as filed to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-49-  

  

 

  the Stockholder Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, without the prior written consent of Stockholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
Acquiror shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company, any Subsidiary
or the Surviving Corporation to, take any of the following actions, if such
action could reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnification claim
by an Indemnified Party under Article IX: (i) amend any Tax Return required to
be filed by or with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, except to the extent necessary in Acquiror's reasonable
good faith judgment to comply with applicable Law; (ii) make or change any Tax
election with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary that applies to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period; or (iii) settle, adjust, or compromise any Tax Contest for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the Acquiror intends to make voluntary disclosures
relating to sales and use taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and shall be
entitled to take all reasonable actions relating to such voluntary
disclosures, including settling, adjusting or compromising related Tax
Contests, provided that any such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall
require the consent of the Stockholder Representative, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 

  

  

(b) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds that are received in cash by Acquiror, the
Company, any Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, and any amounts credited
against Taxes payable to which the Company, any Subsidiary or the Surviving
Corporation becomes entitled, that relate to Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and which are not included as a
Current Asset for purposes of the calculation of Closing Working Capital paid
prior to Closing (excluding any refund or credit that arises as the result of
a carryback of a loss from a Taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date) or Taxes paid pursuant to an indemnity claim under
Article IX shall be for the account of the Indemnifying Parties, and Acquiror
shall pay over to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties) any such refund or the amount of any such credit within
ten (10) days after receipt thereof or entitlement thereto.

  

  

(c) Cooperation. Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with (i) the filing of any Tax
Returns of or with respect to the Company, any Subsidiary or their respective
operations, and (ii) any audit, examination, voluntary disclosure or other
administrative or judicial proceeding, contest, assessment, notice of
deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes
of the Company, any Subsidiary or their respective operations (a "Tax
Contest"). Such cooperation shall include retaining and providing records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Contest, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder.

  

  

(d) Tax Sharing Agreements. In Acquiror's sole discretion, any Tax sharing,
indemnification or allocation agreement, arrangement, practice or policy to
which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound (other
than customary commercial contracts entered into with lenders, lessors,
customers, vendors, or service providers in the ordinary course of business
not primarily related to Taxes) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date,
and none of the Company or any Subsidiary shall have any liability or
obligation pursuant thereto.

  

  

(e) Transfer Taxes. Acquiror and the Indemnifying Parties shall each be
responsible for the payment of fifty percent (50%) of all Transfer Taxes.

  

  

7.6 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Company Option Commitments.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-50-  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) Before the Closing Date, the Company shall take all such actions as are
necessary (including, to the extent necessary, obtaining written consents or
waivers from the holders of the Company Option Commitments) such that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option Commitment that
is outstanding shall be cancelled and all rights related thereto shall be
extinguished as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall obtain a written
release, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from such holder of all
rights relating to such Company Option Commitments.

  

  

(ii) Subject to approval by Acquiror's Board of Directors (or the compensation
committee thereof) and the holder's execution of a written release in
accordance with Section 7.6(a)(i) (if applicable), Acquiror will grant an
Acquiror Restricted Stock Unit Award to each Continuing Employee, with a value
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option Commitment multiplied by the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share
Consideration over (y) the deemed per share exercise price of such Company
Option Commitment. The Acquiror Restricted Stock Unit Award will have the
vesting schedule set forth opposite such Continuing Employee's name in
Schedule C. Acquiror Restricted Stock Unit Awards will be subject to all of
the terms and conditions of the Acquiror Equity Compensation Plan and
Acquiror's form of restricted stock unit award agreement. Acquiror will
provide Continuing Employees with notice of their awards under this Section
7.6(a) as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. Each Acquiror Restricted
Stock Unit Award will be administered in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Acquiror Equity Compensation Plan.

  

  

(b) Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each current
and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries to have entered into
and executed, and each person who becomes an employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing shall be
required by the Company to enter into and execute, an Employee Proprietary
Information Agreement (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Acquiror) with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries effective as of such
employee's first date of employment or service. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts cause each current and former consultant or contractor
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to have entered into and executed, and
each Person who becomes a consultant or contractor of the Company or any
Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing shall be
required by the Company to enter into and execute, a Consultant Proprietary
Information Agreement (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Acquiror) with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries effective as of such
consultant or contractor's first date of service.

  

  

(c) Termination of Employee Plans. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
take all action necessary to terminate the Plan, such termination to be
effective at or before the Effective Time. Effective as of no later than the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any
and all Company Employee Plans intended to include group severance pay or
benefits and any Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan")
unless Acquiror provides prior written notice to the Company that such 401(k)
plans shall not be terminated. The Company shall provide Acquiror with
evidence that any such Company Employee Plan has been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the board of directors (or similar body) of the Company or its
ERISA Affiliates, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Acquiror (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Company also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating any such Company Employee Plan as
the Company and Acquiror may agree upon. In the event that termination of a
401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other early termination charges or penalties, then the
Company shall provide Acquiror with an estimate of such charges and penalties
within ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing.

Business Day after the Closing, on such terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror and subject to each such Other Employee satisfying the
Employment Eligibility Conditions.

employees who do not satisfy the Employment Eligibility Conditions, and, upon
the request of Acquiror, the Company shall terminate the employment of such
employees no later than immediately prior to the Closing Date (each, an
"Ineligible Employee"). The Company shall cause such Ineligible Employee to
execute and return a valid release and waiver agreement containing a general
release of claims against the Company and Acquiror. Any severance or other
payments paid to such Ineligible Employee in connection with such termination
shall be paid by the Company prior to the Closing or, if unpaid, deemed to be
a Third Party Expense of the Company.

  

  

(g) No Employment Commitment or Plan Amendments. No provision of this
Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted, to provide nor create any
third party beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind or nature
whatsoever in any Stockholder, Key Employee, Continuing Employee, Other
Employee, consultant, contractor or any other Person, including any rights of
employment for any specified period and/or any employee benefits, in favor of
any Person, union, association, Continuing Employee, Key Employee, Other
Employee, consultant or contractor or any other Person, other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and all
provisions of this Agreement will be personal solely among the parties to this
Agreement. In addition, no provision of this Agreement is intended, or shall
be interpreted, to amend any term or condition of the Plan or any other
employee related plan, program or policy of the Company or any Subsidiary.

  

  

(h) Post-Signing Hiring Plan. After the date hereof, the Company and Acquiror
shall jointly prepare in good faith a business plan (the "Pre-Closing Hiring
Plan") for anticipated hiring of additional Employees between the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing ("New Hires"). Any such New
Hires shall be eligible to receive an Acquiror Restricted Stock Unit Award to
the extent contemplated by the Pre-Closing Hiring Plan and such New Hire's
offer letter or other written agreement and to the extent such New Hire
becomes a Continuing Employee. A copy of all Company offer letters or other
written agreements made with New Hires under the Pre-Closing Hiring Plan shall
be provided or made available to Acquiror within three (3) Business Days of
their execution. The value of all Acquiror Restricted Stock Unit Awards
granted to New Hires with a start date or anticipated start date (as set forth
in their offer letter) on or prior to the Closing Date (with each restricted
stock unit to be valued at the Acquiror Trading Price) shall be deemed a Third
Party Expense of the Company.

  

  

7.7 Payoff Letters and Release of Liens.

  

  

(a) Payoff Letters. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall obtain from each creditor of the Company or any
Subsidiary, and deliver to Acquiror, an executed payoff letter, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, setting forth: (i) the amounts
required to pay off in full on the Closing Date, the Indebtedness owing to
such creditor (including the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid
interest and prepayment and other penalties) and wire transfer information for
such payment; (ii) upon payment of such amounts, a release of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; and (iii) the commitment of the creditor to release all
Liens, if any, that the creditor may hold on any of the assets of the Company
prior to the Closing Date (each, a "Payoff Letter").

agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents, in form and

appropriate to effect the release of all Liens, including those Liens set
forth in Schedule 7.7(b).

  

  

7.8 Third Party Expenses.

  

  

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, each party shall be responsible
for its own expenses and costs that it incurs (and whether paid prior to, at
or after the Effective Time) with respect to the negotiation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement. Without limiting or expanding the
foregoing, the Company shall be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred
by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary (and whether paid prior to,
at or after the Effective Time) in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting, finders and all other fees and
expenses of third parties incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) any
termination, pre-payment, balloon or similar fees or payments (including
penalties) of the Company or any Subsidiary on account of outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary, or resulting from the early
termination of Contracts, resulting from, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that this clause (ii)
shall not include any amounts included in Closing Indebtedness); (iii) any
bonus, severance, change-in-control payments or similar payment obligations
(including payments with either "single-trigger" or "double-trigger"
provisions) of the Company or any Subsidiary to Employees resulting from, or
in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby, including to any
Ineligible Employees; (iv) any payments in connection with any change in
control obligations resulting from or in connection with the Merger or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any payment or
consideration arising under or in relation to obtaining any consents, waivers
or approvals of any party under any Contract of the Company or any Subsidiary
as are required in connection with the Merger for any such Contract to remain
in full force and effect following the Closing or resulting from agreed-upon
modification or early termination of any such Contract, (v) the cost of any
tail coverage contemplated by Section 7.11(b) and (vi) the value of any
Acquiror Restricted Stock Unit Award to the extent contemplated by Section
7.6(h) (clauses (i) - (vi), collectively, the "Third Party Expenses"). For the
avoidance of doubt, no fees and expenses shall be double counted when
calculating Third Party Expenses.

  

  

(b) At least three (3) Business Day prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide Acquiror with a statement, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Acquiror, setting forth all paid and unpaid Third Party Expenses incurred by
or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, or
anticipated to be incurred or payable by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary after the Closing (the "Statement of Expenses"). The Company shall
take all necessary action to ensure that Third Party Expenses shall not be
incurred by the Company after the Closing Date without the express prior
written consent of Acquiror. No Subsidiary shall incur any Third Party
Expenses.

  

  

7.9 Access to Information. At all times prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall afford Acquiror and its Representatives access to (i) all of the
assets, properties, Books and Records and Contracts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including all Company IP, (ii) all other information concerning
the business, assets, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions
imposed by applicable law) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Acquiror may
reasonably request, and (iii) all Employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as identified by Acquiror. The Company agrees to provide to
Acquiror and its accountants, counsel and other Representatives copies of
internal financial statements (including Tax Returns and supporting
documentation) promptly upon request. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the
Acquiror shall not be provided access to any of the information pursuant to
this Section 7.9 if such access

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-53-  

  

 

  would be in violation of any applicable Laws, including, but not limited
to, the HSR Act and any other applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition
laws. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation conducted
pursuant to this Section 7.9 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to
qualify, limit, modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty
contained herein or in the Disclosure Schedule, the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, or the rights of Acquiror or any
Indemnified Party under or arising out of a breach of this Agreement.

 

  

  

7.10 Notification of Certain Matters

  

  

. The Company shall give prompt notice to Acquiror of: (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is
likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time,
and (b) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
7.10 shall not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the
party receiving such notice or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission
of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to this
Section 7.10, however, shall affect or be deemed to qualify, limit, modify,
amend or supplement any representation or warranty contained herein or in the
Disclosure Schedule, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the rights of Acquiror or any Indemnified Party under or arising
out of a breach of this Agreement.

  

  

7.11 Indemnification of Company officers and Directors.

  

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or its successor shall, and the Acquiror shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its successor to, fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification provisions under
applicable Law, the Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof or
pursuant to the indemnification agreements listed in Schedule 7.11(a) attached
hereto (the "Indemnification Schedule") insofar as such indemnification
provisions relate to the directors and officers of the Company set forth in
the Indemnification Schedule (such directors and officers being herein called
the "Company Indemnitees"). The rights of each Company Indemnitee shall be
enforceable by each such Company Indemnitee or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of the Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation or its successor (i)
shall be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Law and (ii) shall
not be deemed to release any Company Indemnitee who is also an officer or
director of the Company from his or her obligations pursuant to this Agreement
or any Related Agreement, nor shall such Company Indemnitee have any right of
contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving
Corporation or its successor or Parent with respect with any Loss claimed
against such Company Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Company
Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement by any of the
Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Acquiror shall have no
obligation to maintain the existence of the Surviving Corporation for any
specified period following the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) The Company shall purchase, prior to or concurrent with the Closing, a
prepaid policy or policies (i.e., "tail coverage") that will remain in effect
for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the material terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are comparable to those of such policy
currently in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that the Acquiror
shall not cancel such policy for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time; provided, further, that such payments shall be deemed to be a Third
Party Expense of the Company.

-57-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) The Indemnifying Parties shall have no liability for any Losses to the
extent such Losses were taken into account as a liability or a reduction in
the value of assets in determining the final Closing Working Capital.

  

  

(ii) Losses shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
the state of facts giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreements.

  

  

(iii) The amount of any Losses payable under this Article IX by the

this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Parties from and after the Effective Time for any claims arising under this
Agreement, including claims of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement; provided, however,
that (i) this Section 9.2(e) shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any
right to specific performance or injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party (and this Article
IX shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of such Indemnifying
Party) in connection with a claim based on fraud or intentional
misrepresentation committed by such Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement

with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. No Indemnified Party
shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party to be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder. Nothing
in this Agreement shall limit the right of Acquiror or any other Indemnified
Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the parties
thereto.

breach, Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that the Company has not made and is
not making any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject
matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except as provided in Article
III, and that it is not relying and has not relied on any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied, except for the representations and warranties in Article III.

  

  

9.3 Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Except in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional
breach, the Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not recover any Losses
pursuant to an indemnification claim under Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section
9.2(a)(ii) unless and until (i) with respect to any given claim for Losses,
such claim is individually in excess of $25,000 (the "Individual Basket

full amount of such Losses once the claim exceeds such Individual Basket
Amount), and (ii) the Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall have actually
paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least $1,000,000 in Losses in the

incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties as a group. For the
avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this Section 9.3(a) shall not
apply to indemnification claims under clauses (iii) - (x) of Section 9.2(a),
inclusive.

  

  

(b) Except in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional
breach, the Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive source of recovery for
indemnification claims under Section 9.2(a) shall be recourse against the cash
held in the Escrow Fund, and the liability of each Indemnifying Party for
indemnification claims under Section 7.2(a) shall be limited, in the
aggregate, to a dollar amount equal to such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata
Portion of the Escrow Amount.

  

  

(c) In the event of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional
breach, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to bring indemnification
claims directly against the Indemnifying Parties; provided, however, that (i)
the Indemnified Parties shall only be permitted to recover Losses from the
Indemnifying parties in respect of such fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or intentional breach if and the extent that the Escrow Fund is no longer
available, and (ii) in no event shall the liability of any Indemnifying Party
for any fraud, intentional breach or intentional misrepresentation exceed the
Merger Consideration otherwise receivable by such Indemnifying Party hereunder
(but for such fraud, intentional breach or intentional misrepresentation),
unless any such Indemnifying Party either committed or had actual knowledge of
such fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach (in which
event there shall be no limitation on the liability of such Indemnifying Party
hereunder or under applicable Law except to the extent imposed under
applicable Law).

  

  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying
Party in connection with a claim based on fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or intentional breach committed by such Indemnifying Party or with the actual
knowledge of such Indemnifying Party at the time of its commission.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Indemnifying Party shall have any indemnification obligations to any
Indemnified Party with respect to Losses incurred by reason of or arising

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-59-  

  

 

  out of any reduction in the amount of any U.S. federal, state, local and
non-U.S. net operating loss carryover, Tax credit carryover or similar Tax
attribute of the Company or any Subsidiary arising in any Pre-Closing Tax
Period below the amount set forth on the applicable Tax Return with respect to
such period (each, a "Tax Attribute"), whether such reduction occurs by reason
of the carryback or other utilization of such Tax Attribute by the Company,
any Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, the filing of any amended Tax
Return for the Company or any Subsidiary, the redetermination of the amount of
such Tax Attribute by any Governmental Entity or otherwise; provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 9.3(e) shall affect the Indemnifying Parties'
indemnification obligations for Pre-Closing Taxes pursuant to Article IX.

 

  

  

9.4 Indemnification Claim Procedures.

  

  

(a) If an Indemnified Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this
Article IX, such Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice executed by
an Authorized Representative (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) (an
"Indemnification Claim Notice") to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to the
Stockholder Representative) prior to 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Release
Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) for any claims against the Escrow
Fund (or in the event an Indemnified Party elects to pursue such
indemnification claim directly against an Indemnifying Party, to such
Indemnifying Party directly) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay,
incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and (ii) specifying such Losses in reasonable
detail (to the extent available), the date (if available) that each such Loss
was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or the basis for such anticipated
liability, and, if applicable, the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or covenant to which such item is related. Acquiror may update an
Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time to reflect any change in
circumstances following the date thereof.

  

  

(b) If the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
(or the Indemnifying Party in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) shall not object in writing
executed by an Authorized Representative (or such Indemnifying Party, for
direct claims), prior to 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the 30th day after receipt
of an Indemnification Claim Notice (the "Objection Period") by delivery of a
written notice of objection containing a reasonably detailed description of
the facts and circumstances supporting an objection to the applicable
indemnification claim (an "Indemnification Claim Objection Notice"), such
failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or the applicable
Indemnifying Party) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount
of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. In
such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund cash
with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set forth in such Indemnification
Claim Notice.

  

  

(c) In the event that the Escrow Agent (or the applicable Indemnifying Party)
receives an Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section
9.4(b) (or in the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, if such Indemnifying Party shall object
to any claim or claims made in any Indemnification Claim Notice to recover
claims directly from such Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration of the
Objection Period, the Stockholder Representative (or such objecting
Indemnifying Party) and Acquiror shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Stockholder Representative (or such objecting Indemnifying Party) and Acquiror
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed by an Authorized Representative of both parties and, in the case of
an indemnification claim to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be
delivered to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release
from the Escrow Fund cash with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. Should the amount held in the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-60-  

  

 

  Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount to be
paid to an Indemnified Party in accordance with such memorandum, then each
Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the date of
such memorandum, pay to the Indemnified Party, such Indemnifying Party's Pro
Rata Portion of such shortfall in cash.

 

  

  

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, Acquiror may file suit with respect to the matter in any court having
jurisdiction.

  

  

9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. Any written assertion or commencement by
any Person of any Action (whether against Merger Sub, the Company, Parent, any
Indemnified Parties or any other Person), or written threat of an Action by a
Person identifying a specific grievance, with respect to which any
Indemnifying Party may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify,
compensate or reimburse any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX
("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions:

  

  

(a) If the Indemnified Parties shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Parties shall give the Stockholder Representative notice of
such Third Party Claim (a "Third Party Claim Notice") promptly, and in any
event no later than twenty (20) Business Days following the receipt by the
Indemnified Party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure to
provide such Third Party Claim Notice shall not release the Indemnifying
Parties from any of their obligations under this Article IX. The notice of
claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified
Party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and to the extent
determinable the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising
therefrom.

  

  

(b) Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the
defense of, control and settle any such Third Party Claim. The Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in (but not
conduct the defense of, control or settle) any defense of such Third Party
Claim with the consent of Acquiror which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
including by retaining independent legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Acquiror.

  

  

ARTICLE X

  

STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

  

  

10.1 Appointment and Authority of Stockholder Representative.

  

  

By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, and the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Stockholders,
each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint The
Brenner Group, Inc. as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder
Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to give and
receive notices and communications in respect of indemnification claims under
this Agreement to be recovered against the Escrow Fund, to authorize payment
to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any
indemnification claims hereunder by any Indemnified Party, to object to such
payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to any such indemnification claims, to assert,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to,
any such indemnification claim by any Indemnified Party hereunder against any
Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified
Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying
Party, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms
of this Agreement. The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time
during the term of the Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice in the
event of (i) any action or inaction of the Indemnifying Parties that prevents
the Stockholder Representative

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-61-  

  

 

  from being able to reasonably perform its duties hereunder; or (ii) any
continuing failure to pay any amounts due to the Stockholder Representative
hereunder; or (iii) any subsequent amendments to this Agreement that
materially increases Stockholder Representative's responsibilities as
originally contemplated by this Agreement. The Stockholder Representative may
be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than 30
days prior written notice to Acquiror; provided, however, that the Stockholder
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of
the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative.
Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall
constitute notice to or from the Indemnifying Parties.

 

  

  

10.2 Exculpation and Indemnification of Stockholder Representation. To the
maximum extent permissible by Law, the Stockholder Representative will incur
no liability of any kind with respect to any action or inaction taken or
failed to be taken, by the Stockholder Representative or by its agents, in
connection with its services as the Stockholder Representative, except its own
willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Stockholder Representative may act
in reliance upon any signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and may
reasonably assume that such person has proper authorization to sign on behalf
of the Company. In all questions arising under this Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative may rely on the reasonable advice of counsel, accountants or
other skilled persons, and the Stockholder Representative will not be liable
to the Company or the Indemnifying Parties, or any other person or party for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Stockholder
Representative based on such advice of counsel, accountants or other skilled
persons, as the case may be. The Indemnifying Parties on whose behalf the
Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall indemnify, defend and
save harmless the Stockholder Representative and its members, managers,
directors, officers, agents and employees (the "Indemnitees") from and against
any and all Losses arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder
Representative's acceptance, execution, administration and performance of this
Agreement and the Stockholders Representatives duties hereunder ("Stockholder
Representative Expenses"). The Representative Expense Amount shall be
available to pay directly, or reimburse the Stockholder Representative for,
any Stockholder Representative Expenses, including the fees and costs of any
professional advisors retained by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties. Following the Expiration Date, the resolution of all
indemnification claims made under this Agreement and the satisfaction of all
such indemnification claims, the Stockholder Representative shall have the
right to recover Stockholder Representative Expenses not previously recovered
from the Representative Expense Fund from the Escrow Fund prior to any
distribution to the Stockholders, and prior to any such distribution, shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the Stockholder
Representative Expenses actually incurred. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including an amendment,
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.5 or Section
11.6, shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon the Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and
Acquiror may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Indemnifying Parties. The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and agree
that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement. The
Stockholder Representative will not be required to advance its own funds for
any reason, and may be reimbursed from (i) future distributions to the
Indemnifying Parties (to the extent such amounts have not previously been
paid) and (ii) any available expense funds; provided, that the Indemnifying
Parties shall promptly pay the Indemnitees for any indemnifiable Losses upon
request as each such Loss is incurred. The Escrow Agent and Acquiror are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative. The Stockholder Representative may execute any of its powers
and perform any of its duties

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-62-  

  

 

  hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable
only for the careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult
with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and
retained by it. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in
no event shall the Stockholder Representative be liable for special, indirect,
punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but
not limited to lost profits), regardless of whether or not any such damages
were foreseeable or contemplated and even if the Stockholder Representative
has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage, no matter the form
of action.

 

  

  

10.3 Conflict of Interest.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees, and
Affiliates that the Company is the client of Perkins Coie LLP (the "Firm"),
and not any of its individual Stockholders. After the Closing, it is possible
that the Firm will represent the Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative
and their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "Seller
Group") in connection with the transactions contemplated herein or in the
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Fund and any claims made thereunder pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Acquiror and the Company hereby agree
that the Firm (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group in the future
in connection with issues that may arise under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the administration of the Escrow Fund and any claims that may be
made thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Firm
(or any successor) may serve as counsel to all or a portion of the Seller
Group or any director, member, partner, officer, employee, representative, or
Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.
Each of the parties hereto consents thereto, and waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom, and each such party shall cause any Affiliate
thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that such consent and
waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the
parties have consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in
this connection.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties to this Agreement,
understands and agrees that, with respect to all communications among the
Firm, the Seller Group and/or the Stockholders Representative and their
respective Affiliates that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time and that
relate to the negotiation of this Agreement and the several transactions
contemplated hereby ("Privileged Communications"), from and after the
Effective Time, the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product
privilege and any and all other legal privileges, will belong solely to
Acquiror and its Affiliates by operation of law and will be controlled only by
Acquiror and its Affiliates and shall not be retained by, pass to or, be
claimed by, or otherwise be available in any manner to the Seller Group and/or
the Stockholders Representative and their respective Affiliates, whether in
relation to indemnification or other claims by any Indemnified Party hereunder
or by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror shall afford
the Stockholders Representative and its accountants, counsel and other
representatives, access to such Privilege Communication to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Stockholders Representative to evaluate or defend
a claim for indemnification under Article IX; provided, however, that Acquiror
shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if Acquiror
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable
Law or jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, provided,
further, that in the event that Acquiror does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding proviso, it shall use its reasonable
best efforts to communicate the applicable information to the Stockholders
Representative in a way that would not violate the applicable law or to waive
such a privilege.

information obtained in any investigation pursuant to Section 7.9 or any
information obtained pursuant to the notice requirements of Section 7.10, or
otherwise pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the
effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of November 5, 2012 (as
amended from time to time, the "Confidential Disclosure Agreement"), between
the Company and Acquiror.

  

  

11.4 Public Disclosure. Neither the Company nor any of its Representatives
shall issue any statement or communication to any third party (other than its
agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject
matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor,
without the consent of Acquiror.

  

  

11.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party
against whom enforcement is sought. For purposes of this Section 11.5, the
Stockholders are deemed to have agreed that any amendment of this Agreement
signed by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon and effective
against the Stockholders whether or not they have signed such amendment.

  

  

11.6 Extension and Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, Acquiror, on the
one hand, and the Company and the Stockholder Representative, on the other
hand, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party

  instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. For purposes of this
Section 11.6, the Stockholders are deemed to have agreed that any extension or
waiver signed by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon and
effective against all Stockholders whether or not they have signed such
extension or waiver.

otherwise, except that Acquiror may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as long as Acquiror remains ultimately
liable for all of Acquiror's obligations hereunder.

  

  

11.8 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  

  

11.9 Specific Performance and Other Remedies.

  

  

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto, any Stockholder or the
Stockholder Representative of any covenant, obligation or other agreement set
forth in this Agreement, (i) each party shall be entitled, without any proof
of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy that may be available
to it), to a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus to enforce
the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or other agreement
and an injunction preventing or restraining such breach or threatened breach,
and (ii) no party hereto shall be required to provide or post any bond or
other security or collateral in connection with any such decree, order or
injunction or in connection with any related action or legal proceeding.

  

  

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred herein upon a party hereto
shall be deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or in equity upon such party, and the exercise by
a party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

  

  

(c) The liability of any Person under Article IX will be in addition to, and
not exclusive of, any other liability that such Person may have at law or in
equity based on such Person's fraudulent acts or omissions, or willful
misconduct or intentional misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth in this
Agreement, including the provisions set forth in Article IX, shall be deemed a
waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or remedy which such party
may have at law or in equity based on any other Person's fraudulent acts or
omissions or willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, nor will any
such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit (i) the amounts of recovery
sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation
(ii) the time period during which a claim for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation may be brought or (iii) the recourse which any such party
may seek against another Person with respect to a claim for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

  

  

11.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-66-  

  

 

 

 

  

11.11 Exclusive Jurisdiction. Subject to Section 9.4, each of the parties
hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in connection with any matter based
upon or arising out of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other matters contemplated herein (or,
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware). Subject to Section 9.4, each party agrees not to commence any legal
proceedings related hereto except in such Court of Chancery (or, only if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, in any federal court within the State of Delaware).
By execution and delivery of this Agreement, subject to Section 9.4, each
party hereto and the Stockholders irrevocably and unconditionally submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate courts
therefrom solely for the purposes of disputes arising under the this Agreement
and not as a general submission to such jurisdiction or with respect to any
other dispute, matter or claim whatsoever. The parties hereto and the
Stockholders irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the delivery of
copies thereof by overnight courier to the address for such party to which
notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process shall be
effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable law. The parties hereto
and the Stockholders hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or
proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason, or that
it or any of its property is immune from the above-described legal process,
(ii) that such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that
venue for the action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by such courts, or (iii) any other defense that would hinder
or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any party
hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

  

  

11.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  

  

11.13 USA Patriot Act Compliance. To help the government fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business
entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for
documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The
Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses,
identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority
to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The parties each
agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as
requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.

  

  

11.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, Annex A hereto, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Related Agreements, and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and are not intended to
