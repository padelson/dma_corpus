and deliveries referred to in Articles VI, VII and VIII have been satisfied,
or at such other time, date and place that shall be mutually agreed upon by
the parties hereto (the " _Closing Date_ "). At the Closing, each of
the Shareholders shall sell, transfer, convey or assign and deliver to FSAC,
and FSAC shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Shareholders, the
Shares, free and clear of any and all Liens or rights of any third party (and
each of the Shareholders shall thereafter cease to have any as a shareholder
in ATS other than any rights granted to the Shareholders pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents) and FSAC shall
deliver to the Shareholders Representative on behalf of the Shareholders the
Stock Consideration and an amount equal to the Cash Consideration, and
deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Deposits pursuant to Section 2.2.

  



  

2.2 _Purchase Consideration_.

  



  

As payment in full for all of the Shares and termination of all of the
Options, FSAC shall pay to the Shareholders Representative (a) at Closing

below (clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph collectively the "
_Purchase Consideration_ ").

  



  

(a) _Cash Consideration and Escrows_. At the Closing FSAC shall make the

 _Consideration Amount_ " (defined below). The Shareholders
Representative shall be responsible for directing the distribution of the
Cash Consideration first, to pay in full each Option Holders Net Option
Payment as shown on Schedule 3.10(b) and then to the Shareholders (pro-rata
in proportion to the Shareholders Proportionate Interests, as adjusted to
reflect that the General Indemnity Escrow Deposit, the Expense Escrow Deposit
and the Accounting Method Tax Escrow Deposit shall be made only from the Cash
Consideration that would otherwise be payable at Closing to the Founders) and
FSAC shall be entitled to fully rely on such directions.

  



  

(ii) _Escrows_. At the Closing, FSAC shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the
following amounts (collectively the " _Escrow Deposits_ "):  (1) $500,000
(the " _Balance Sheet Escrow Deposit_ ") to be held by the Escrow Agent in an
escrow account (the " _Balance Sheet Escrow Account_ ") pursuant to the terms
of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B-1_ (the "

_General Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit B-2_ (the " _General
Indemnity Escrow Agreement_ "); (3) $150,000 (the " _Expense Escrow Deposit_
") to be held in an escrow account (the " _Expense Escrow Account_ ") by the

hereto as _Exhibit B-4_ (the " _Accounting Method Tax Escrow Agreement_ "
and together with the Balance Sheet Escrow Agreement, the General Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, and the Expense Escrow Agreement collectively referred to
as the " _Escrow Agreements_ "). The escrow accounts set up by the Escrow
Agent with respect to each of the Escrow Agreements are hereinafter
individually referred to as an " _Escrow Account_ " and collectively as the "
_Escrow Accounts_." The aggregate amount held in the Escrow Accounts by the
Escrow Agent at any time and from time to time, together with any interest or
appreciation thereon, shall be referred to as the " _Escrowed Funds_ " with
that portion of the Escrowed Funds held from time to time in the Balance
Sheet Escrow Account being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "

share of the Shareholders Proportionate Interest of the Closing
Consideration in the form of FSACs common stock (" _Stock Consideration_ ")
rather than in the form of Cash Consideration. The amount of the Closing
Consideration that each such Founder has elected to receive in Stock
Consideration is set forth opposite his name on _Exhibit C_ (the " _Stock
Consideration Amount_ "), and the amount of the Cash Consideration otherwise
payable to him pursuant to Section 2.2(a) shall be reduced by his Stock
Consideration Amount.

  



  

(ii) _FSAC Shares Constituting Stock Consideration_. The number of FSAC
shares of common stock to be issued as Stock Consideration shall be
determined for each Founder on the Closing Date by dividing the Stock
Consideration Amount for each Founder by the Average Share Value.

  



  

(iii) _Fractional Shares_. If the calculation of the number of shares of FSAC
common stock to be received as Stock Consideration pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(ii) would result in the issuance of fractional shares, then the number
of shares of FSAC common stock that the Founder would otherwise receive as

").

  



  

(c) _Contingent Payments_. Pursuant to the terms and conditions described
below in this Section 2.2(c), the Shareholders shall be entitled to the earn
out compensation (collectively the " _Earn Out_ ") described in this Section
2.2(c).

  



  

(i) _Base Earn Out_. Depending on the "EBITDA" (as that term is defined
below) of ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries (excluding the Discontinued
Business Line for all purposes under this Section 2.2(c)) for the period from
November 1, 2005 through April 30, 2007, the Shareholders shall be entitled
to an earn out (the " _Base Earn Out_ ") of up to Fifteen Million
Dollars ($15,000,000), consisting of the "October 2006 Base Earn Out Payment"
and the "April 2007 Base Earn Out Payment" (as hereinafter
defined), contingent upon the extent to which the terms and conditions of
this Section 2.2(c)(i) are satisfied.

  



  

(A) _October 2006 Base Earn Out Period_. If during the period from November
1, 2005 through October 31, 2006, ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries
generate EBITDA (the " _October 2006 Base Earn Out Period EBITDA_") in
excess of Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) (the " _Base Earn Out Threshold_
"); then the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive a payment (the "
_October 2006 Base Earn Out Payment_") in an amount equal Three and Three
Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty-Three Ten Thousandths Dollars ($3.3333) for
each dollar by which the October 2006 Base Earn Out Period EBITDA exceeds the
Base Earn Out Threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the

(B) _April 2007 Earn Out Period_. If during the period from May 1, 2006
through April 30, 2007, ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries generate EBITDA in
excess of the Base Earn Out Threshold (the " _April 2007 Base Earn Out
Period EBITDA_"); then the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive a
payment (the " _April 2007 Base Earn Out Payment_") calculated as follows:

  



  

(1) If the April 2007 Base Earn Out Period EBITDA is greater than the Base
Earn Out Threshold but does not exceed Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($10,500,000), then the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive as
an April 2007 Base Earn Out Payment an amount equal to Four Dollars ($4.00)
for each dollar by which the April 2007 Earn Out Period EBITDA exceeds the
Earn Out Threshold; or

  



  

(2) If the April 2007 Earn Out Period EBITDA is greater than Ten Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($10,500,000); then the Shareholders shall be
entitled to receive as the April 2007 Base Earn Out Payment an amount equal
to (y) Six Million Dollars plus (z) One and Twenty-Five One Hundredths
Dollars ($1.25) for each dollar by which the April 2007 Base Earn Out Period
EBITDA exceeds Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($10,500,000);
provided, however that in no event shall the April 2007 Earn

  



        
   

  



  

Out Earn Out Payment calculated under this Section 2.2(c)(i)(B)(2) exceed Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000).

  



  

(ii) _Additional Earn Out_. ATS has submitted a proposal (the " _Hawaiian
Proposal_ " to the United States Air Force Pacific Rim Engineering Technical
Service. If ATS is awarded the contract related to the Hawaiian Proposal on
or before October 31, 2006 then the Shareholders shall be entitled to the
"2007/2008 Additional Earn Out" (as hereinafter defined). If ATS is awarded
the contract related to the Hawaiian Proposal after October 31, 2006, but
prior to April 30, 2008, then ATS may be entitled to the "2008 Additional
Earn Out" described below. If ATS is awarded the contract related to the
Hawaiian Proposal after April 30, 2008, then ATS shall not be entitled to any
additional earn out. In no event shall the aggregate 2007/2008 Additional
Earn Out or the 2008 Additional Earn Out exceed Twenty Four Million Dollars
($24,000,000).

  



  

(A) _2007/2008 Additional Earn Out_. If ATS is awarded the contract related
to the Hawaiian Proposal on or before October 31, 2006 then the Shareholders
shall be entitled to receive an additional earn out for the period ending
April 30, 2008 (the " _2007/2008 Additional Earn Out_ ") calculated as
follows:

  



  

(1) If during the period from May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2007, ATS
and the Acquired Subsidiaries generate EBITDA (the " _April 2007
Additional Earn Out Period EBITDA_") in excess of Thirteen Million Seven
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,700,000) (the " _April 2007 Additional Earn
Out Threshold_"); then the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive a
payment (the " _April 2007 Additional Earn Out Payment_") in an amount
equal to Six Dollars ($6.00) for each dollar by which the April 2007
Additional Earn Out Period EBITDA exceeds the April 2007 Additional Earn
Out Threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the April
2007 Additional Earn Out Payment exceed Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000);
and

  



  

(2) If during the period from May 1, 2007 through April 30, 2008, ATS
and the Acquired Subsidiaries generate EBITDA (the " _April 2008
Additional Earn Out Period EBITDA_") in excess of Fourteen Million
Dollars ($14,000,000) (the " _April 2008 Additional Earn Out
Threshold_"); then the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive a payment
(the " _April 2008 Additional Earn Out Payment_") in an amount equal to Six
Dollars ($3.00) for each dollar by which the April 2008 Additional Earn Out
Period EBITDA exceeds the April 2008 Additional Earn Out Threshold.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the April 2008 Additional
Earn Out Payment exceed Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000);

  



  

(B) _2008 Additional Earn Out_. If (i) ATS is awarded the contract related to

2008 and (ii) during the period from May 1, 2007 through April 30, 2008, ATS
and the Acquired Subsidiaries generate EBITDA (the " _2008 Additional Earn
Out Period EBITDA_ ") in excess of Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000)
(the " _2008 Additional Earn Out Threshold_ "); then the Shareholders shall
be entitled to receive a payment (the " _2008 Additional Earn Out Payment_ ")
in an amount equal to Six Dollars ($6.00) for each dollar by which the 2008
Additional Earn Out Period EBITDA exceeds the 2008 Additional Earn Out
Threshold (the " _2008 Additional Earn_

  



        
   

  



  

 _Out_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the 2008
Additional Earn Out Payment exceed Twenty Four Million Dollars ($24,000,000).

  



  

(iii) _Calculation of EBITDA_. For purposes of this Section 2.2(c) " _EBITDA_

the Companies consolidated annual audited income statements (so long as
ATS prepares annual audited income statements or, if ATS does not prepare

(iv) _Calculation and Payment of Earn Out_.

  



  

(A) _Calculation_.

  



  

(1) _October 2006 Earn Out Payment_. The amount of October 2006 Earn Out
Payment, if any, due the Shareholders under this Section 2.2(c) shall be
calculated by FSAC and such calculation, together with reasonably detailed
support (the " _October 2006 Earn Out Notice_") shall be delivered to the
Shareholders Representative within twenty (20) days after receipt by FSAC of
its review for the October 2006 Earn Out Period.

  



  

(2) _April 2007 and April 2007 Additional Earn Out Payments_. The amounts of
the April 2007 and April 2007 Additional Earn Out Payments, if any, due the
Shareholders under this Section 2.2(c) shall be calculated by FSAC and
such calculation, together with reasonably detailed support (the " _April
2007 Earn Out Notice_") shall be delivered to the Shareholders
Representative within fifteen (15) days after filing of FSACs Form 10-Q with
the SEC for the second quarter of 2007.

  



  

(3) _April 2008 Additional and 2008 Additional Earn Out Payments_. The
amount of the April 2008 Additional Earn Out Payment or 2008 Additional Earn
Out Payment, if any, due the Shareholders under this Section 2.2(c) shall be
calculated by FSAC and such calculation, together with reasonably detailed
support (the " _April 2008 Earn Out Notice_") shall be delivered to the
Shareholders Representative within fifteen (15) days after filing of FSACs
Form 10-Q with the SEC for the second quarter of 2008.

  



  

(B) _Cash Payment_. If within twenty (20) days following delivery of the
October 2006, April 2007 or April 2008 Earn Out Notice, as applicable, the
Shareholders Representative has not given FSAC notice of his objection to
the computation (which notice must contain a statement in reasonable detail
of the basis of any such objection), then such computation shall be final. If
the Shareholders Representative gives notice of an objection, the parties
shall use their respective best efforts to resolve any dispute by
negotiation. If such dispute cannot be settled by negotiation within fifteen
(15) days after the Shareholders Representatives notice, the dispute shall
be resolved in accordance with the Financial Issue Resolution Process set
forth in Section 2.4. As calculations of all or portions of the October 2006
Earn Out Payment, April 2007 Earn Out Payment, April 2007 Additional Earn Out
Payment, April 2008 Additional Earn Out Payment and 2008 Additional Earn Out
Payment, as applicable, become finalized (fifteen (15) days following
delivery of the October 2006, April 2007 or April 2008 Earn Out Notice, as
applicable, if there is no dispute, or following resolution of the dispute
pursuant to the preceding sentence), payments of the October 2006, April
2007, April 2007 Additional, April 2008 Additional and 2008 Additional Earn
Out Payments, as applicable, supported by those final calculations shall be
made by FSAC to the Shareholders Representative within five (5) Business Days
of the date those calculations are finalized. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, payments of the October 2006, April 2007, April 2007 Additional,
April 2008 Additional and 2008 Additional Earn Out Payments otherwise payable
under this Section 2.2(c)(iv) are subject to FSACs offset rights as set
forth in Section 9.2(g). All sums payable by FSAC to the Shareholders
Representative under this Section 2.2(c)(iv) shall be paid by FSAC to an
account or accounts designated by the Shareholders Representative. The
Shareholders Representative shall be responsible for directing the
distribution of the Earn Out to

  



        
   

  



  

the Shareholders (pro-rata in proportion to the Shareholders Proportionate
Interests) and FSAC shall be entitled to fully rely on such directions.

  



  

(C) _Promissory Note Option for April 2007 and April 2008 Additional Earn
Out Payments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
2.2(c) above, FSAC, at its option may elect to pay up to twenty five percent
(25%) of either the April 2007 Additional or April 2008 Additional Earn
Out Payments by delivery of a Promissory Note payable to the
Shareholders Representative in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_. The
Shareholders Representative shall be responsible for directing the
distribution of any and all payments on any such Promissory Note to the
Shareholders (pro rata in proportion to the Shareholders Proportionate
Interests) and FSAC shall be entitled to fully rely on such directions.

  



  

2.3 _Cash Consideration and Net Working Capital Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) _Cash Consideration_. The " _Cash Consideration_ " shall be an amount
equal to Eighty Five Million Dollars ($85,000,000) (the " _Estimated Closing
Cash Purchase Price_ ") as adjusted upward or downward pursuant to Sections
2.3(b) and (c) below a portion of which shall be deposited into the Escrow
Accounts in accordance with Section 2.2(a)(ii).

  



  

(b) _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet._ Not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, ATS shall deliver to FSAC an estimated, unaudited,
consolidated balance sheet of ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries (the "
_Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as of the Closing Date, together with
all supporting documentation. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared by ATS, in accordance with GAAP and in accordance with ATS
accounting principles, policies, practices, classifications and methodologies
as reflected in the preparation of the October 2005 Balance Sheet (" _ATS
Accounting Practices_ "); _provided_ , _ however_ , that to the extent that
any ATS Accounting Practices are not in compliance with GAAP, GAAP shall
control for purposes of preparing the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall also include a calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital (hereinafter defined).

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Closing Net Working Capital" shall mean
the amount, as of the Closing Date and as shown by the Closing Balance Sheet,
by which ATS current assets (which shall exclude cash and include
accounts receivable, notes receivable, prepaid expense, inventories and other
current assets) exceed its current liabilities (which for purposes of this
definition shall exclude Indebtedness to the extent reflected in current
liabilities). For the avoidance of doubt, current liabilities shall include
any of the Founders Transaction Costs not paid or reimbursed by the Founders
at or prior to the Closing pursuant to Section 5.8; _provided_ that the
Founders shall in no event bear more than 100% of the Founders Transaction
Costs. Closing Net Working Capital shall be calculated (A) on a consolidated
basis for ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries using the accrual method of
accounting and (B) in accordance with ATS Accounting Practices; _provided,
however_ , that to the extent that any ATS Accounting Practices are not in
compliance with GAAP, GAAP shall control for purposes of preparing the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet.

  



  

(c) _Adjustments to Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price_. The Estimated
Closing Cash Purchase Price will be adjusted (i) downwards on a dollar-for-
dollar basis to the

  



        
   

  



  

extent that the Closing Net Working Capital, as shown on the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, is below the Base Net Working Capital and (ii) upwards
on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent that the Closing Net Working
Capital is above the Base Net Working Capital.

  



  

(d) _Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Net Working Capital_. Promptly
following the Closing, FSAC will cause RSM McGladrey (or an equivalent firm
selected by FSAC) **** to review the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet,
including the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Net Working Capital as
reflected thereon. Based on such review, FSAC will deliver a proposed Closing
Balance Sheet, prepared in a manner consistent with Section 2.3(b)
above together with all related work papers, to the Shareholders
Representative within thirty (30) Business Days after the later of (i) the
Closing Date, or (ii) the date of receipt by FSAC of all information
sufficient for FSAC to complete its review of all aspects of the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Proposed Closing Balance Sheet_ "). If within
fifteen (15) **** Business Days following delivery of the Proposed
Closing Balance Sheet, the Shareholders Representative has not given FSAC
notice of his objection to the Proposed Closing Balance Sheet (which notice
must contain a statement in reasonable detail of the basis of any such
objection), then such Proposed Closing Balance Sheet shall constitute the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ ," and the Closing Net Working Capital amount
included therein shall constitute the "Closing Net Working Capital." If the
Shareholders Representative gives notice of an objection, the parties
shall use their respective best efforts to resolve any dispute by
negotiation. If such dispute cannot be settled by negotiation within thirty
(30) **** days after receipt by FSAC of the Shareholders Representatives
notice, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the Financial Issue
Resolution Process set forth in Section 2.4.

  



  

(e) _Final Adjustment to the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price_. If the
Closing Net Working Capital is such that Sections 2.3(d) and/or 2.4 do not
require an adjustment to the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price, then the
Escrow Agent shall disburse to the Shareholders Representative the Balance
Sheet Escrow within five (5) days after the finalization of the Closing
Balance Sheet pursuant to Sections 2.3(d) and/or 2.4. If the Closing Net
Working Capital is such that Sections 2.3(d) or 2.4 require an adjustment to
the Estimated Closing Cash Purchase Price, any amount due to the Shareholders
by FSAC in excess of the Balance Sheet Escrow shall be paid by FSAC to the
Shareholders Representative, and any amount due to FSAC from the
Shareholders shall be paid to FSAC by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow and,
if the amount due FSAC is in excess of the Balance Sheet Escrow Funds, then
such excess shall be paid to FSAC by the Shareholders within five (5) days
after the finalization of the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to Sections
2.3(d) and/or 2.4. In the event that the Shareholders for any reason fail to
make the payment contemplated in the previous sentence, then FSAC may bring
an indemnification claim under ARTICLE IX and the Founders shall be liable
for that payment in accordance with ARTICLE IX. Any earnings on the Balance
Sheet Escrow Funds, net of escrow expenses and taxes, shall be paid, pro
rata, to the parties receiving distributions from the Balance Sheet Escrow
Account. All sums payable by the Escrow Agent to the Shareholders
Representative under this Section 2.3(e) shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to
an account or accounts designated by the Shareholders Representative. The
Shareholders Representative shall be responsible for directing the
distribution of the Balance Sheet Escrow (pro-rata in proportion to the
Shareholders Proportionate Interests) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to fully rely on such directions.

  



        
   

  



  

2.4 _Financial Issue Resolution Process_.

  



  

Disputes between FSAC and the Shareholders Representative, that cannot be
resolved by negotiation within thirty (30) days after receipt by FSAC of the
Shareholders Representatives notice in accordance with Sections 2.2(c) or
2.3(d) shall be referred no later than such 30th day for decision to a
nationally-recognized independent public accounting firm mutually selected by
the Shareholders Representative and FSAC (which firm shall not be either (a)
RSM McGladrey or (b) Grant Thornton LLP, and provided that each party
discloses to the other parties any pre-existing relationships with any
accounting firms prior to the mutual selection of an accounting firm) (the "
_Auditor_ ") who shall act as arbitrator and determine, based solely on
presentations by the Shareholders Representative and FSAC and only with
respect to the remaining differences so submitted. If such accounting firm
cannot be identified within ten (10) business days after the identification
of the need for dispute resolution, the dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with Section 11.11. The Auditor shall deliver its written
determination to FSAC and the Shareholders Representative no later than the
30th day after the remaining differences underlying the dispute are referred
to the Auditor, or such longer period of time as the Auditor determines is
necessary. The Auditors determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties. The fees and disbursements of the Auditor shall be allocated
equally between FSAC and the Shareholders Representative. FSAC and the
Shareholders shall make readily available to the Auditor all relevant
information, books and records and any work papers relating to the dispute
and all other items reasonably requested by the Auditor. In no event may the
Auditors resolution of any difference be for an amount that is outside the
range of FSACs and the Shareholders Representatives disagreement.

derivative, or similar instrument.

  



  

(f) _Contingent or Deferred Acquisition Expenses or Payments_. Except as
otherwise disclosed on Schedule 3.5(f) of the Disclosure Schedules, neither

the SEC on October 20, 2005, as amended to date, the " _Public Disclosure
Documents_ "). The Public Disclosure Documents, as amended prior to the date
hereof, complied, as of the date of their filing with the SEC, as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
Securities Act, as applicable. The information contained or incorporated by
reference in the Public Disclosure Documents was true, complete and correct
in all material respects as of the respective dates of the filing thereof
with the SEC; and, as of such respective dates, the Public Disclosure
Documents did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent updated or superseded by any Public
Disclosure Document subsequently filed by FSAC with the SEC prior to the date

(b) The financial statements of FSAC included in the Public Disclosure
Documents have been prepared in accordance with the published rules and
regulations of the

  



        
   

  



  

SEC and in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated therein, except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto, and presented fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of FSAC as of the dates indicated, and the consolidated

Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

4.10 _Financial Ability_.

  



  

To the Knowledge of FSAC, no condition of FSAC exists, other than the
approval by FSACs stockholders, and the related failure of public FSAC
stockholders owning 20% or more of the FSCA public shares to both vote
against the Contemplated Transactions and exercise their conversion or "put"
rights, that could reasonably be expected to prevent FSAC from acquiring the
funds necessary to finance the Contemplated Transactions.

Neither FSAC nor any director, officer, agent, employee, or other person
associated with or acting on behalf of FSAC has, directly or indirectly: used

(i) to cause FSACs accountants to review the October 2006 Earn Out Period
promptly after the end of the October 2006 Earn Out Period and to (ii) to
timely file FSACs Form 10-Q with the SEC for the second quarter of 2007.

  



  

5.4 _Consents_.

  



  

Without limiting the generality of Section 5.3 hereof, each of the parties
hereto (other than Harry Katrivanos) will use its best efforts to obtain all
licenses, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals of all third
parties and governmental authorities necessary

  



        
   

  



  

in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Closing. Each of the parties hereto (other than Harry
Katrivanos) will make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under
laws and regulations applicable to it as may be required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. FSAC, the Shareholders
and ATS will coordinate and cooperate with each other in exchanging such
information and assistance as any of the parties hereto may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing.

  



  

5.5 _Access to Books and Records Following the Closing_.

  



  

Following the Closing, FSAC shall permit the Shareholders and their
authorized representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to have reasonable access to, and examine and make copies of, all
books and records of ATS, the Acquired Subsidiaries and/or FSAC that relate
to transactions or events occurring prior to the Closing or transactions or
events occurring subsequent to the Closing that are related to or arise out
of transactions or events occurring prior to the Closing; _provided, however_
, (a) that the Shareholders and their representatives shall take such
action as is deemed necessary in the reasonable judgment of FSAC and ATS to
schedule such access and visits through a designated officer of ATS and in
such a way as to avoid disrupting the normal business of FSAC and/or ATS, (b)
neither FSAC nor ATS shall be required to take any action that would
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege and (c) neither
FSAC nor ATS need supply the Shareholders, or their representatives, with any
information which, in the reasonable judgment of FSAC or ATS, FSAC or ATS (as
the case may be) is under a contractual or legal obligation not to supply,
including, without limitation, as a result of any governmental or defense
industrial security clearance requirement or program requirements of any
Governmental Authority prohibiting certain persons from sharing information.
FSAC agrees that it shall retain and shall cause ATS to retain all such books
and records for a period of seven years following the Closing, or for such
longer period following the Closing as may be required by applicable Law.

  



  

5.6 _Founders  Post-Closing Confidentiality Obligation_.

  



  

Following the Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement or in other agreements delivered in connection herewith, the
Founders shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers agents
and representatives, as applicable to, (a) maintain the confidentiality of,
(b) not use, and (c) not divulge, to any Person all confidential or
proprietary information of ATS, except with the prior written consent of FSAC
or to the extent that such information is required to be divulged by legal
process, except as may reasonably be necessary in connection with the
performance of any indemnification obligations under this Agreement or except
as may be required by Law; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing
limitations shall not apply to information that (i) otherwise becomes
lawfully available to the Founders, or their respective Affiliates, officers
agents and representatives after the Closing Date on a nonconfidential basis
from a third party who is not under an obligation of confidentiality to FSAC
or ATS or (ii) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach
of this Agreement by the Founders, or their respective Affiliates, officers
agents and representatives.

  



        
   

  



  

5.7 _Expenses_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.7, each of the parties
shall bear its own expenses related to the Contemplated Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all compensation due Stifel and other third-
party costs of the Shareholders, ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions including all payments to be made in
connection with the Change In Control Releases and other the amounts referred
to on Schedule 5.7 of the Disclosure Schedules (collectively, the " _Founders
 Transaction Costs_") shall be the responsibility of the Founders and, to
the extent payable at Closing, and not otherwise paid by the Founders, shall
be paid at Closing in accordance with Section 5.8(a).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation to pay Taxes shall be
allocated pursuant to Section 5.11 rather than this Section 5.7.

  



  

5.8 _Certain Closing Payments_.

  



  

(a) The Founders shall be obligated to repay all Indebtedness of ATS and the
Acquired Subsidiaries as of the Closing. In connection with the Closing, FSAC
shall repay out of the Cash Consideration, on behalf of the Founders, (i) all
Indebtedness of the ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries remaining outstanding
(other than intercompany indebtedness (if any)), and (ii) all Founders
Transaction Costs. To the extent the amount of any such payment can be
determined, and paid, at or prior to the Closing, then a downward adjustment
shall be made in the Cash Consideration paid at Closing equal to such amount.
In the event any such payment cannot be determined or paid at or prior to
Closing, then (i) the parties to the Escrow Agreements shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay any such amount (from the Balance Sheet Escrow to the
extent of any Balance Sheet Escrow Funds and then from the General Indemnity
Escrow) to FSAC within three (3) Business Days of determination (which may be
through delivery of an invoice) and (ii) the Founders hereby agree and
covenant that they shall be jointly and severally responsible for and shall
immediately deposit in the General Indemnity Escrow cash in the amount of the
distributions made from the Escrowed Funds to cover costs the Founders are
responsible for under this Section 5.8.

  



  

(b) It is the intent of the parties that all Shareholders shall be deemed to
have repaid any and all loans outstanding and owing by any of the
Shareholders to ATS or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Shareholders Representative shall be permitted to make, or direct, non-pro
rata distributions of the Cash Consideration to the Shareholders in order to
account for any such deemed repayments.

  



  

5.9 _No Solicitation of Competitive Transactions_.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, ATS and each of
the Founders agree that they will not, directly or indirectly, through any
officer, director, employee, representative or agent or any of their
affiliates, (i) solicit, initiate, entertain or encourage any inquiries or
proposals that constitute, or could lead to, a proposal or offer for a
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, sale of
substantial assets, sale of a substantial percentage

  



        
   

  



  

of shares of capital stock (including, without limitation, by way of a public
offering or private placement), joint venture (other than teaming agreement
or similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business) or similar
transactions involving ATS or any of its subsidiaries, other than a
transaction with FSAC and/or its affiliates (any of the foregoing inquiries
or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii)
engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public
information to any person or entity relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) agree to, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal. ATS will
notify FSAC immediately (and not later than twenty-four (24) hours) after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or records of ATS by any person or entity that informs ATS that it is
considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be
made orally (and shall be confirmed in writing) and, subject to existing
confidentiality, nondisclosure or other similar agreements, shall indicate
the identity of the party making the proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contract. ATS will prevent any of its
directors, officers, affiliates, representatives or agents (each a "
_Representative_ ") from taking any action prohibited hereby if taken by ATS.
If ATS learns of any such action taken by a Representative, ATS will
immediately advise FSAC and provide the information specified herein.

  



  

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, FSAC, its
affiliates or its Representatives engages in " _Material Negotiations_ " (as
hereinafter defined) concerning a merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, purchase of substantial assets, purchase of
shares of capital stock, joint venture or similar transactions involving a
party other than ATS or any of its subsidiaries (each a " _Proposed
Transaction_ ," but not including Proposed Transactions initiated prior to
the date of this letter)), FSAC shall promptly notify the Shareholders
Representative or ATS representative, Daniel M. Cornell (" _Cornell_ "), of
the same. For purposes of this letter, the term "Material Negotiations" shall
mean the delivery by FSAC to a third party of a term sheet or a letter of
intent. Any notice of a Proposed Transaction (i) shall be made orally (and
shall be confirmed in writing), (ii) shall identify the parties to, and the
terms of the Proposed Transaction, and (iii) shall be subject to existing
confidentiality, nondisclosure and other similar agreements. The
Shareholders Representative and Cornell each agree, as a condition to
receiving notices with respect to any Proposed Transaction, to execute and
deliver to FSAC such additional non-disclosure, confidentiality or similar
agreement as may be required by FSAC.

  



  

5.10 _Personnel_.

  



  

FSAC intends that all Personnel employed by any of the Companies as of the
Closing Date shall have the opportunity to continue as an employee of the
respective Companies following the Closing Date. This Section 5.10 shall not
create any rights to continued employment.

  



        
   

  



  

5.11 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_.

  



  

FSAC shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed,
on a timely basis (in each case, at its sole cost and expense) and on a
basis reasonably consistent with past practice (unless FSAC is advised
otherwise by its outside tax consultants), all Tax Returns with respect to
ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date and required to be filed thereafter (the " _Prior Period
Returns_ "). FSAC shall provide a draft copy of such Prior Period Returns to
the Shareholders Representative for its review at least fifteen (15)
Business Days prior to the due date thereof. The Shareholders Representative
shall provide its comments to FSAC at least five Business Days prior to the
due date of such returns and FSAC shall make all changes requested by ATS in
good faith (unless FSAC is advised in writing by its independent outside
accountants or attorneys that such changes (i) are contrary to applicable
Law, or (ii) will, or are likely to, have a material adverse effect on FSAC
or any of its Affiliates (provided that FSAC agrees to make any such changes
notwithstanding the application of this clause (ii) if the changes are
consistent with applicable Law and past practices of the Companies)). Except
as provided in Section 5.11(c), and _only_ to the extent such Taxes have not
been accrued or otherwise reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheets (and
specifically reflected in Closing Net Working Capital), the Founders shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect to ATS and the Acquired
Subsidiaries shown to be due on such Prior Period Returns. In the event that
the Founders for any reason fail to make the payment contemplated in the
previous sentence, then FSAC may bring an indemnification claim under ARTICLE
IX.

  



  

(b) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_.

  



  

(i) FSAC shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed,
on a basis reasonably consistent with past practice, any Tax Returns of ATS
and the Acquired Subsidiaries for Tax periods that begin before the Closing
Date and end after the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Straddle Periods_ "
and each a " _Straddle Period_ "). FSAC shall permit the
Shareholders Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence prior to filing, and FSAC shall make all
changes reasonably requested by ATS in good faith (unless FSAC is (1) advised
in writing by its independent outside accountants or attorneys that such
changes are contrary to applicable Law or (2) will, or are likely to, have a
material adverse effect on FSAC or any of its Affiliates (provided that FSAC
agrees to make any such changes notwithstanding the application of this
clause (2) if the changes are consistent with applicable Law and past
practices of the Companies)). Within fifteen (15) days after the date on
which FSAC pays any Taxes of ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries with respect
to any Straddle Period, the Founders shall, to the extent such Taxes have not
been accrued or otherwise reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheets (and
specifically reflected in the Closing Net Working Capital), pay to FSAC the
amount of such Taxes that relates to the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "). In the event
that the Founders for any reason fail to make the payment contemplated in the
previous sentence, then FSAC may bring an indemnification claim under Article
IX.

  



  

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



        
   

  



  

(1) In the case of any gross receipts, income, or similar Taxes that are
payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes
allocable to (A) the Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning on the day next succeeding the Closing Date (the "
_Post-Closing Tax Period_ ") shall be determined on the basis of a deemed
closing at the end of the Closing Date of the books and records of ATS.

  



  

(2) In the case of any Taxes (other than gross receipts, income, or similar
Taxes) that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period prior to the
Closing Date shall be equal to the product of all such Taxes multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
from the commencement of the Straddle Period through and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period; _provided, however_ , that appropriate adjustments shall be
made to reflect specific events that can be identified and specifically
allocated as occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (in which case the
Founders shall be responsible for any Taxes related thereto) or occurring
after the Closing Date (in which case, FSAC shall be responsible for any
Taxes related thereto).

  



  

(iii) FSAC shall be responsible for (A) any and all Taxes with respect to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period of any applicable Straddle Period to (but only to)
the extent such Taxes have been accrued or otherwise reserved for on the
Closing Balance Sheet and (B) any Taxes with respect to the Post-Closing
Tax Period of the Straddle Periods.

  



  

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  



  

(i) FSAC and the Founders shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation, or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding and making their respective employees, outside consultants and
advisors available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. FSAC and the
Founders agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by FSAC or the
Shareholders Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other so requests, FSAC or the Founders, as the case may
be, shall allow one of the others to take possession of such books and
records.

  



  

(ii) FSAC and the Founders further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  



        
   

  



  

(iii) FSAC and the Founders further agree, upon request, to provide the other
party with all information that either party may be required to report
pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Department Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(iv) The Shareholders shall provide to FSAC for its review and approval all
material related to the securing of shareholder approval under section 280G
of the Code for the parachute payments identified on Schedule 3.29. Such
material shall be provided to FSAC at least five business days prior to the
obtaining of such shareholder approval. The Shareholders and FSAC agree that
all documents related to such shareholder approval must be mutually agreed to
by the Shareholders Representative and FSAC.

  



  

(d) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions
(including any transfer or similar tax imposed by any governmental authority)
shall be shared equally between FSAC on the one hand and the Founders on the
other, and each shall be responsible for one-half of such Taxes. The party
required by Law to do so will file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable
Law, the other parties will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

  



  

(e) _Indemnification and Tax Contests_. FSACs and the Founders
indemnification obligations with respect to the covenants in this Section
5.11 together with the procedures to be observed in connection with any Tax
Contest shall be governed by Article IX.

  



  

5.12 _Public Announcements_.

  



  

None of FSAC, ATS, any of the Acquired Subsidiaries or the Shareholders, will
issue any press release or make any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, or disclose the existence of this
Agreement to any Person or entity, prior to the Closing and, after the
Closing, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to any applicable
disclosure obligations pursuant to Applicable Law provided that if FSAC
proposes to issue any press release or similar public announcement or
communication in compliance with any such disclosure obligations and related
to the Contemplated Transactions, FSAC shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with the Shareholders Representative before
doing so.

  



  

5.13 _Communications with Customers and Suppliers_.

  



  

The Shareholders Representative and FSAC will mutually agree upon
all communications with suppliers and customers of ATS relating to this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions prior to the Closing Date.

  



        
   

  



  

5.14 _Stifel Agreement_.

  



  

All compensation due Stifel with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions (collectively, the " _Stifel Fees_ "), whether under the Stifel
Agreement or otherwise, is the Founders responsibility. The Founders shall
deliver to FSAC at the Closing a release signed by Stifel and in form
reasonably satisfactory to FSAC (the " _Stifel Release_ ") confirming that
the Stifel Fees have been paid in full and releasing ATS, the Acquired
Subsidiaries and FSAC from all liability with respect to the Stifel Agreement
(other than indemnification claims that may be brought by Stifel against ATS
or the Acquired Subsidiaries under the terms of the Stifel Agreement and
other than with respect to 2.5% of any payments of the 2007/2008 or the 2008
Additional Earn Outs which shall be due and payable to Stifel). The Founders
hereby agree to indemnify and hold FSAC harmless from and against any
indemnification claims brought by Stifel (or any person or entity bringing an
indemnification claim through Stifel) under or with respect to the Stifel
Agreement.

  



  

5.15 _Notification of Certain Matters; Update of Disclosure Schedules_.

  



  

(a) _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Founders (and Harry Katrivanos to
the extent of his individual representations and warranties made in this
Agreement) and ATS shall give prompt notice to FSAC and FSAC shall give
prompt notice to the Shareholders and ATS, of (i) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii)
any material failure of ATS, the Acquired Subsidiaries, the Shareholders, or
FSAC, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided,
however, subject to Sections 5.15(b) and 9.2(f), that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.15(a) shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  



  

(b) _Update of Disclosure Schedules_. The Shareholders and ATS may, at their
option, but no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing,
deliver to FSAC the Disclosure Schedules updated to the date of Closing (the
" _Updated Disclosure Schedules_ "), except where the disclosures or
information therein are as of a specified date which disclosures and
information shall remain as of such date. Any Updated Disclosure Schedules
shall be prepared in a manner such that the Updated Disclosure Schedules
clearly indicates differences between the Disclosure Schedules as delivered
on this date of this Agreement and the Updated Disclosure Schedules. If
Updated Disclosure Schedules are delivered by ATS, such Updated Disclosure
Schedules shall not alter the representations and warranties of the
Shareholders and ATS as set forth in this Agreement and the Disclosure
Schedules, _provided_ , _however_ , that liabilities under Section 9.2(b)
in respect of representations and warranties that are affected by the
Updated Disclosure Schedules shall be limited as set forth in Section 9.2(f).

  



  

5.16 _Discontinued Business Line and Certain Other Matters_

  



  

(a) _Discontinued Operations_. ATS has discontinued its ATSI business line
(the " _Discontinued Business Line_ ", and the products and services of the
Discontinued Business Line, the " _Discontinued Products_ "). The ATSI
business lines is treated as discontinued

  



        
   

  



  

operations in the Interim Financial Statements, in accordance with GAAP. The
Founders and ATS jointly and severally represent and warrant to FSAC that the
accounting for the Discontinued Business Line as discontinued operations, as
reflected in the Interim Financial Statement, reflects, to the Knowledge of
ATS, adequate reserves in relation to such operations (including all
obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement dated November 30, 2005
pursuant to which ATS sold its former subsidiary, ATSI, to NTMI Acquisition
Co., and the indemnification obligations related to the warranty claim
brought by the City of Statesville, North Carolina against ATSI), including,
without limitation, appropriate estimates of expenses to be incurred in
connection with the operations of such discontinued operations after the
respective dates of treatment as discontinued operations through the
respective dates of cessation of operations, in accordance with GAAP. The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet will also reflect such reserves, including
such adjustments as may be required as of the Closing Date as a result of
changes in circumstances and estimates since the date of the Interim
Financial Statements.

  



  

(b) _Maximus Subcontract_. ATS has entered into a time and material price
subcontract with Maximus, Inc. to provide certain software and services in
support of Maximus prime contract with the State of Connecticut (the "
_Maximus Subcontract_ "). ATS performance of the Maximus Subcontract to date
has been at a loss. The Founders and ATS jointly and severally represent and
warrant to FSAC that the Interim Financial Statements reflect ATS good faith
estimate to complete work under the Maximus Subcontract, and reserves in
accordance with GAAP, such that, apart from the reserves reflected in the
January 2006 Interim Financial Statements, ATS does not reasonably expect to
incur additional losses under the Maximus Subcontract. The Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet will also reflect such reserves, including such adjustments as
may be required as of the Closing Date as a result of changes in
circumstances and estimates since the date of the Interim Financial
Statements. If the Maximus Subcontract is terminated prior to Closing upon
terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to FSAC, this Agreement shall be
amended to omit this Section 5.15(b).

  



  

(c) _Self Insured Plans_. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet will reflect a
reserve, estimated on the basis of past experience and experience through the
Closing Date, which will reflect the estimated cost of ATS self-insurance
under the Self Insured Plans through the Closing Date. ATS will fully
disclose to FSAC the basis of the computation of the reserves for the Self
Insured Plans reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. ATS is in the
process of replacing the Self Insured Plans with fully insured plans. In
connection with this replacement, ATS will be required to purchase an
insurance "tail" for run-off liability. The Founders shall jointly and
severally indemnify FSAC, subject to the limitations set forth in ARTICLE IX
on the indemnification obligations of the Founders, for the amount of medical
claims and related administrative costs arising in respect of the run-off
period to the extent they exceed accrued reserves therefor as of the Closing
Date and are not covered by the "tail" or "stop loss" insurance. To the
extent that medical claims and related administrative costs arising in
respect of the run-off period that are not covered by the applicable
insurance are less than the reserve therefor reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet, the excess shall be refunded to the Shareholders, pro rata in
accordance with the Shareholders Proportionate Interests.

  



  

(d) _Hawaiian Proposal_. In connection with the submission of the Hawaiian
Proposal, ATS has established an office in Honolulu, Hawaii (the " _Hawaiian
Office_ "). The Hawaiian Proposal was submitted on or about November 8, 2005.
ATS intends to close the

  



        
   

  



  

Hawaiian Office if the Hawaiian Proposal is not selected by the United States
Air Force as the winning proposal. If the Hawaiian Proposal is not selected
by the United States Air Force as the winning proposal, subject to the
limitations set forth in ARTICLE IX on the indemnification obligations of the
Founders, the Founders shall jointly and severally indemnify FSAC for all
costs of closing the Hawaiian Office including, but not limited to all (i)
rent and other expenses due during the balance of the term of the lease
(expiring November 30, 2007) for the Hawaiian Office and (ii) reasonable
actual costs of closing the Hawaiian Office.

  



  

5.17 _Certain Transfers at Closing_.

  



  

(a) ATS currently leases certain automobiles for use by the Founders in
connection with ATS business. As of the Closing, ATS shall transfer the
leases of the automobiles to the Founders currently using the automobiles,
and such Founder shall assume and be responsible for all payments and
obligations under such lease from and after Closing.

  



  

(b) ATS currently subscribes to season tickets for the Washington Redskins.
After Closing ATS no longer will need such tickets for business purposes, and
if Delmar Lewis wishes to use the tickets from and after Closing, FSAC agrees
to cooperate with him to cause ATS to transfer or make available the tickets
to him through the current term of the subscription; _provided_ that he
assumes and pays all costs associated with the tickets.

  



  

(c) ATS currently maintains split-dollar life insurance policies on the lives
of the respective Founders, as disclosed on Schedule 3.30(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules. As of the Closing, ATS shall transfer such policies to
the respective Founders upon whose lives the insurance is based, and each
such Founder shall assume and be responsible for all payments and obligations
under his respective insurance policy from and after Closing.

  



  

5.18 _Certain Post Closing Covenants of FSAC_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 5.18, FSAC hereby covenants and
agrees that during the various Earn Out periods set forth in Section 2.2(c)
FSAC shall use reasonable efforts to continue the business and operations of
ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries in the ordinary course and, to the extent
consistent therewith, to maintain ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries
respective relationships with customers, employees, suppliers, and others
having business dealings with ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, FSAC shall, during the
various Earn Out periods set forth in Section 2.2(c), except as may otherwise
be agreed upon in writing by the Shareholders Representative:

  



  

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companies to enter into
contracts in connection with their sales pipelines as of the Closing;

  



  

(ii) make available to the Companies capital sufficient, consistent with past
practice, for working capital purposes and other business needs;

  



  

(iii) not take or permit to be taken any action that would result in it not
being possible to account for the operations of the Companies in a manner
consistent with paragraph (c) below;

  



        
   

  



  

(iv) not permit any or all of the Companies to be merged or otherwise
combined with any other entity (except for one or more of the other
Companies);

  



  

(v) not take any action to terminate or reduce the base compensation of Leon
Perry, Doug Manning or Martin Gillepsie, it being recognized that FSAC
intends to make such persons participants in an ATS key employee protection
plan that will be put in effect immediately after the Closing; and

  



  

(vi) not, except on behalf of any of the Companies, solicit business of the
type in which any of the Companies are engaged from any specific contracting
unit of a Person that is or at any time during the preceding twelve (12)
months was a customer of any of the Companies.

  



  

(b) FSAC agrees and acknowledges that the Earn Out payments will be
calculated in accordance with the methodology and procedures set forth in
Section 2.2(c). In furtherance of such methodology and procedures, FSAC
agrees that, except as may otherwise be agreed upon in writing by the
Shareholders Representative, during the various Earn Out periods set forth
in Section 2.2(c):

  



  

(i) the Companies will not be charged with any FSAC corporate overhead
(except to the extent FSAC provides, or otherwise bears the cost of, services
to the Companies) or any incremental costs not consistent with historical
norms or past practices of the Companies prior to the Closing Date,
_provided_ that this clause (i) shall not be interpreted to (w) prohibit the
replacement of personnel who do not remain with the Companies following the
Closing or other actions reasonably designed to increase or maintain EBITDA
levels, (x) prevent the recognition of increased costs due to changes in
general cost levels related to the conduct of the Companies business, (y)
prevent the recognition of uncontrollable increased costs that arise out of
the conduct of the Companies business after the Closing, or (z) prohibit the
incurrence of costs that may be passed on to customers or otherwise do not
have a material effect on EBITDA;

  



  

(ii) prior to the use by a business unit of FSAC or any of its Affiliates
(other than any of the Companies) (each a " _Business Unit_ ") of any
employee of any of the Companies (other than incidental use that does not
interfere with the performance of the employees normal duties) on a bid,
proposal or other business development activity or a project of a Business
Unit where the revenue therefrom would not otherwise be included in the
calculation of EBITDA pursuant to Section 2.2(c), FSAC and the Shareholders
Representative shall negotiate in good faith and agree as to the costs of
such employee(s) of any of the Companies that will be reimbursed to the
Companies, or the portion of revenue generated by the utilization of such
employee(s) of any of the Companies (less applicable direct costs) on such
Business Units project would be attributable to the Companies, as the case
may be, for purposes of the calculation of EBITDA pursuant to Section 2.2(c);

the interests of the Companies and the Shareholders and will allocate the
opportunity in a manner that is reasonable and fair to all parties.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) FSAC recognizes that, in order to compute the amounts that may be due to

Out Payment, it will be necessary for FSAC to maintain accounting records

Subsidiaries (other than the Discontinued Business Line) in a manner that

April 2007 Earn Out Payment.

to, fully cooperate with FSAC in connection with the preparation of
proxy materials, to be filed with the SEC and mailed to the stockholders of
FSAC seeking approval of the Contemplated Transactions by the FSAC
stockholders (such proxy materials, in the form mailed to the FSAC
stockholders, the " _Proxy Materials_ "). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, ATS and the Founders and their respective Representatives
shall review and provide information to FSAC for inclusion in the Proxy
Materials describing the business and affairs of ATS and the Acquired
Subsidiaries, including financial statements of ATS, and the Acquired
Subsidiaries. Further, ATS will cause Grant Thornton, LLP to deliver to FSAC,

the Shareholders, such unaudited financial statements as FSAC prepares,
with respect to the operations conducted by ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries
(other than the Discontinued Product Line), prior to the Closing Date, in the
ordinary course of business. The monthly financial information referenced in
the previous sentence (i) will be prepared internally, (ii) may, or may
not be prepared in accordance with, or otherwise be in conformity with GAAP,
(iii) if not prepared in accordance with GAAP then will not be adjusted for

makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(b) with respect to
such a receivable, FSAC shall, or shall cause ATS to, as applicable, assign
to the Founders pro rata in accordance with the Founders Proportionate
Interests) all right, title and interest (including all causes of action with
respect thereto) in and to such receivable. In the event that any receivables

Founders agree to use reasonable efforts to coordinate any collection efforts
with respect to collection of those receivables.

  



  

5.23 _Accounting Method Taxes_.

  



  

Effective as of November 1, 2004 the Companies changed their method of
accounting from cash to accrual resulting in an associated tax liability of
approximately Seven Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($7,150,000)
payable in four installments of approximately One Million Seven Hundred
Eighty-Seven Thousand Dollars ($1,787,000) each payable over the Companies
tax years commencing in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 (the "Accounting Method
Tax") of which approximately One Million Seven Hundred Eighty-Seven Thousand
Dollars ($1,787,000) has been paid in connection with Companies Tax returns
for the Tax year commencing in 2004 and of which approximately Five Million
Three Hundred Sixty-Two Thousand Dollars ($5,362,000) remains outstanding.
Pursuant to Section 2.2(a) the Accounting Method Tax Escrow has been
established to pay the Accounting Method Tax. As and when installments of the
Accounting Method Tax are due (which with respect to any such installment
shall mean the date that is 2 ½ months after the fiscal year end with respect
to which such installment is payable), FSAC and the Shareholders
Representative shall cause to be distributed from the Accounting Method Tax
Escrow to FSAC an amount (each distribution being hereinafter referred to as
an "Accounting Method Tax Distribution") equal to the Accounting Method Tax
installment then payable for the current tax period as reduced, on a dollar
for dollar basis, by the NOLs used by the Companies in the then current tax
period (the amount by which Accounting Method Taxes are reduced by NOLs in
any applicable tax period is hereinafter referred to as the "NOL Reduction").
As and when FSAC and the Shareholders Representative cause an Accounting
Method Distribution to be made they shall also instruct the Escrow Agent to
distribute from the Accounting Method Tax Escrow to the
Shareholders Representative an amount equal to the applicable NOL reduction,
if any, used to calculate the applicable Accounting Method Tax Distribution.
Upon final payment of the Accounting Method Tax, the remaining balance in the
Accounting Method Tax Escrow, if any shall be distributed to the account(s)
designated by the Shareholders Representative in accordance with the
Accounting Method Tax Escrow Agreement. The Shareholders Representative
shall be responsible for directing the distribution of any Accounting Method
Tax Distribution (pro-rata in proportion to the Founders Proportionate
Interests) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to fully rely on such
directions. Any earnings on the Accounting Method Tax Escrow Funds, net of

  



        
   

  



  

escrow expenses and taxes, shall be paid, pro rata to the Founders in
accordance with their respective Founders Proportionate Interests. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in ARTICLE IX to the contrary,
any Accounting Method Tax payable pursuant to this Section 5.23 shall first
be paid from the Accounting Method Tax Escrow.

  



  

5.24 _E-Mail Access Through ATS_.

  



  

For a period of six (6) months following the Closing FSAC will cause ATS to

Section 2.3(e) and the Founders or ATS obligations pursuant to Article V
(including but not limited to Founders obligations under Sections 5.7, 5.8,
5.11(a), 5.11(b) and 5.14) (C) Taxes as provided in paragraph (ii) of this
Section 9.2(b), to the extent such Taxes have not been accrued or otherwise
reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet (it being the intent of the parties
that all of the provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted to avoid
requiring the Shareholders to pay (or receive a reduction in the Purchase
Consideration) twice for the same Tax).

  



  

(ii) The obligations of the Founders under paragraph (i) of this Section
9.2(b) shall extend to (A) all Taxes with respect to taxable periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date and (B) all Taxes with respect to Straddle
Periods to the extent that such Taxes (1) are allocable to the period prior
to Closing pursuant to Section 5.11(b)(ii) and (2) have not been

  



        
   

  



  

accrued or otherwise reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet. The
obligations of the Founders under paragraph (i) of this Section 9.2(b) shall
also extend to any Accounting Method Tax, reduced on a dollar for dollar
basis by the NOLs used by the Companies in the Tax period with respect to
which such Accounting Method Tax is to be paid, in excess of the Accounting
Method Tax Escrow Funds regardless of whether such Taxes are imposed for a
taxable year beginning before, on, or after the Closing Date. Any FSAC
Indemnitee upon which such Excess Accounting Method Tax is imposed shall be
permitted, solely to the extent Accounting Method Tax Escrow Funds are no
longer available, to recover such Taxes directly from the General Indemnity
Escrow Account. Such obligations shall be without regard to whether there was
any breach of any representation or warranty under Article III with respect
to such Tax or any disclosures that may have been made with respect to
Article III or otherwise. The indemnification obligations under this
paragraph (ii) shall apply even if the additional Tax liability results from
the filing of a return or amended return with respect to a pre-Closing Date
transaction or period (or portion of a period) by FSAC. FSAC shall not cause
or permit ATS or any Acquired Subsidiary to file an amended Tax Return with
respect to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period unless (y) the Shareholders Representative consents in its
sole discretion or (z) FSAC obtains a legal opinion (in form and content
reasonably acceptable to the Shareholders Representative) from counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Shareholders Representative that such amendment
is legally required to be filed (provided, further, that such legal opinion
may not assume any facts that are disputed in good faith by the
Shareholders Representative). In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Section 9.2(b)(ii) and any other provision of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall control.

  



  

(iii) Subject to Sections 9.2(e), 9.2(f), 9.2(h), 9.2(i) and 9.3, each of
the Shareholders severally and not jointly shall protect, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the FSAC Indemnitees from and against any Losses, that may
be sustained, suffered or incurred by FSAC Indemnitees and that are related
to any breach by such Shareholder of his or her representations and
warranties in the following Sections of this Agreement: 3.1(a), 3.2(b),
3.3(b), 3.4(b), 3.11(a), 3.32(b) and 3.33(b).

  



  

(c) _Procedure for Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(i) If any Third-Party Claims shall be commenced, or any claim or demand
shall be asserted (other than audits or contests with Taxing Authorities
relating to Taxes), in respect of which the Indemnified Party proposes to
demand indemnification by Indemnifying Party under Sections 9.2(a) or 9.2(b),
the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such
demand and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the entire
control of the defense, compromise or settlement thereof (including the
selection of counsel), subject to the right of the Indemnified Party to
participate (with counsel of its choice), but the fees and expenses of such
additional counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party will not compromise or settle any such action, suit,
proceeding, claim or demand (other than, after consultation with Indemnified
Party, an action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand to be settled by the
payment of money damages and/or the granting of releases, _provided_ that no
such settlement or release shall acknowledge the Indemnified Partys
liability or obligate FSAC with respect to activities of ATS) without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, or delayed.

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
9.2(c), FSAC at its expense shall have the sole right to control and make all
decisions regarding interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to Taxes, including selection of counsel and selection of
a forum for such contest, _provided, however_ , that in the event such audit
or proceeding relates to Taxes for which the Founders are responsible and
have agreed to indemnify FSAC, (A) FSAC, ATS, and the Shareholders shall
cooperate in the conduct of any audit or proceeding relating to such period,
(B) the Founders, acting through the Shareholders Representative, shall have
the right (but not the obligation) to participate in all facets of such audit
or proceeding at the Founders expense (including, but not limited to, the
right to be present at all meetings and on all telephone conversations and to
receive copies of all correspondence, emails and other forms of
nonverbal communications related to the Taxes in question), (C) FSAC shall
not enter into any agreement with the relevant taxing authority pertaining to
such Taxes without the written consent of the Shareholders Representative,
which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, and (D) FSAC may, without
the written consent of the Founders, enter into such an agreement provided
that FSAC shall have agreed in writing to accept responsibility and liability
for the payment of such Taxes and to forego any indemnification under this
Agreement with respect to such Taxes.

  



  

(iii) The parties will keep each other informed as to matters related to any
audit or judicial or administrative proceedings involving Taxes for
which indemnification may be sought hereunder, including, without
limitation, any settlement negotiations. Refunds of Tax relating to periods
ending prior to the Closing Date (or to that portion of a Straddle Period
that is prior to Closing under the principles of Section 5.11(b)(ii)) shall
be the property of the Shareholders, but only to the extent that such refunds
are not attributable to (A) net operating loss or other carrybacks from
periods ending after the Closing Date, or (B) refund claims that are
initiated by FSAC ( _provided_ that FSAC gives the Shareholders
Representative prior notice of such possible claim and the Shareholders
decline to pursue such refund at its or their own expense); _provided,
however_ , that FSAC shall in no event have an obligation to file or cause to
be filed a claim for refund with respect to any Taxes relating to any period.

  



  

(iv) Any indemnity payment or payment of Tax by the Founders or its or their
Affiliates as a result of any audit or contest shall be reduced by the
present value of the correlative amount, if any, by which any Tax of FSAC or
its Affiliates is or will be reduced for periods ending after the Closing
Date as a result thereof.

  



  

(v) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in all respects with the
Indemnifying Party in any defense, compromise or settlement, subject to this
Section 9.2(c) including, without limitation, by making available all
pertinent books, records and other information and personnel under its
control to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(d) _Procedure for Direct Claims_.

  



  

(i) Any Direct Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party (each a " _Direct Claim Notice_
"). The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of twenty (20) Business Days
from the date of receipt (the " _Direct Claim Notice Period_ ") within which
to respond to a Direct Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not
respond in writing within the Direct Claim Notice Period, then the
Indemnifying

  



        
   

  



  

Party shall be deemed to have accepted responsibility for the claimed
indemnification and shall have no further right to contest the validity of
that claim. If the Indemnifying Party does respond in writing within the
Direct Claim Notice Period, and rejects the claim in whole or in part, the
Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue all remedies under Section 11.11.
To the extent that any FSAC Indemnitees prevail in a Direct Claim (or the
Shareholders Representative concedes (on behalf of the Shareholders), or
otherwise does not timely respond to a Direct Claim Notice made by FSAC) then
the Direct Claim shall be satisfied from the General Indemnity Escrow (and
the Escrow Agent shall pay to FSAC from the General Indemnity Escrow the
amount of the Direct Claim) with no further action required by the
Shareholders, or the Shareholders Representative. In the event that a Direct
Claim is in excess of the General Indemnity Escrow, the Founders shall be and
remain jointly and severally liable for any or all of such excess, subject to
the limitations of this ARTICLE IX, including without limitation, Sections
9.2(e) and 9.2(f).

  



  

(ii) _Costs Related to Direct Claims_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 9.2 to the contrary, except as otherwise may be ordered by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the Shareholders Indemnitees and FSAC Indemnitees
shall each bear their own costs, including counsel fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with Direct Claims against FSAC and the Shareholders,
respectively hereunder that are not based upon claims asserted by third
parties.

  



  

(e) _Calculation of Amount of Claims and Losses_. The amount of any claims or
losses subject to indemnification under Section 9.2(b) shall be calculated
net of any amounts recovered by FSAC or its Affiliates (including ATS after
the Closing) under applicable insurance policies held by FSAC or its
Affiliates, and FSAC agrees to make or cause to be made all reasonable claims
for insurance under such policies that may be applicable to the matter giving
rise to the indemnification claim hereunder. The amount of any claims or
losses subject to indemnification under Section 9.2(b) shall be calculated
net of the present value of any Tax benefits to FSAC or its Affiliates
(including ATS and the Acquired Subsidiaries after the Closing) resulting
from the matter giving rise to the indemnification claim hereunder (computed
at the highest effective marginal tax rates at which FSAC is then paying
Taxes and limited to the extent that the Tax Benefits can be utilized by
FSAC).

  



  

(f) _Limitations on Rights of FSAC Indemnitees_. Rights of FSAC Indemnitees
to indemnification by the Founders and the several Shareholders for breaches
of representations and warranties hereunder shall be subject to the
limitations that (i) FSAC Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification with respect to a claim or claims of breach of representation
and warranty by the Founders or Shareholders unless the aggregate amount of
all such claims made thereunder exceed $375,000, in which event the indemnity
provided for in this Section 9.2 shall be effective with respect to the total
amount of such damages in excess of $375,000, and (ii) the Shareholders
aggregate maximum liability to FSAC Indemnitees under this Article IX shall
not exceed Eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars $11,500,000;
_provided_ , _however_ , that rights of FSAC Indemnitees to indemnification
by the Founders and the several Shareholders, as applicable, for breaches of
representations and warranties based on facts and circumstances reflected in
the Updated Disclosure Schedules, if any, but not in the Disclosure Schedules
dated as of the date of this Agreement, shall be effective only to the extent
such Losses constitute Disclosure Schedule Update Losses, and such Disclosure
Schedule Update Losses shall be subject to the limitations set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence.

  



        
   

  



  

The aforementioned limitations shall not apply to the "Non-Threshold
Indemnifications" as hereinafter defined. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Non-Threshold Indemnifications_ " shall mean and refer collectively
to indemnification liabilities of the Shareholders pursuant to claims based
(i) on the breach of Sections 2.3(e), 5.7, 5.8, 5.11(a), 5.11(b), 5.14, or
5.16(d) ( _provided_  that claims based on a breach of Section 5.16(d) shall
be subject to the $11,500,000 limitation set forth above); or (ii) the
representations and warranties of the Shareholders and ATS pursuant to
Section 3.11 (Title), Section 3.28 (ERISA), Section 3.29 (Taxes), D and
O Indemnification Claims pursuant to Section 3.25 or clauses (B), or (C)
of Section 9.2(b)(i); or (iii) claims based on fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or criminal acts on the part of the
Shareholders, ATS, the Acquired Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, agents, representative and trustees.

  



  

(g) _Limitations on Rights of Shareholders Indemnitees._ The rights of
Shareholders Indemnitees to indemnification by FSAC for breaches of
representations and warranties hereunder shall be subject to the limitation
that Shareholders Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification with
respect to a claim or claims for a breach of representation and warranty by
FSAC unless the aggregate of damages with respect to all such claims exceeds
$100,000, in which event the indemnity provided for in this Section 9.2 shall
be effective with respect to the amount of such damages. The aforementioned
limitations shall not apply to the indemnification liabilities of FSAC with
respect to claims based on fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or criminal
acts on the part of FSAC.

  



  

(h) _Limitation on Rights of Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the Shareholders each acknowledge and agree that that they shall
have no right to make a claim against ATS or any Acquired Subsidiaries
pursuant to any indemnity provision or agreement or otherwise in respect of
Claims of FSAC Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9.2(b).

  



  

(i) _Limitations on Remedies_. No party hereto shall be liable to the other
for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages claimed
by such other party resulting from such first partys breach of its
obligations, agreements, representations or warranties hereunder, provided
that nothing hereunder shall preclude any recovery by an Indemnitee against
an Indemnitor for third party claims.

  



  

9.3 _General Indemnity Escrow Account_.

  



  

(a) Pursuant to Section 2 and the General Indemnity Escrow Agreement, at the
Closing, FSAC shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the General Indemnity Escrow
Deposit and the Escrow Agent shall set up an escrow account pursuant to the
terms of the General Indemnity Escrow Agreement to secure the Founders
indemnification obligations under this Article IX. Within thirty (30) day
following the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Initial
Escrow Distribution Date_ "), the parties to the Escrow Agreement shall
instruct the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to
deliver to the accounts designated by the Shareholders Representative an
amount equal to the Initial Escrow Distribution (as hereinafter defined), if
any. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Initial Escrow Distribution_
" shall mean the General Indemnity Escrow Deposit (including any
undistributed earnings received thereon) less the sum of: (i) Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000), (ii) any disbursements previously made from the General
Indemnity Escrow to FSAC or the Escrow Agent, and (iii) an

  



        
   

  



  

amount equal to the total of all then outstanding claims by FSAC Indemnitees.
The remaining balance of the General Indemnity Escrow, if any, less the sum
of the total of all then outstanding indemnity claims by FSAC Indemnitees
(including amounts offset pursuant to Section 9.4 that have not been
resolved), shall be delivered by the Escrow Agent to the Shareholders
Representative on April 30, 2008 to the accounts designated by the
Shareholders Representative in accordance with the terms of the General
Indemnity Escrow Agreement. The Shareholders Representative shall be
responsible for directing the distribution of the General Indemnity Escrow
(pro-rata in proportion to the Founders Proportionate Interests) and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to fully rely on such directions. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that they shall promptly sign joint instructions (i)
authorizing the Escrow Agent to release the appropriate funds on the Initial
Escrow Distribution Date and April 30, 2008 and (ii) authorizing the Escrow
Agent to release funds subject to outstanding claims (including funds held as
a result of offsets under Section 9.4) as those claims are resolved pursuant
to Section 11.11.

  



  

(b) Any earnings on the General Indemnity Escrow Funds, net of escrow
expenses and taxes, shall be paid, pro rata, to the parties receiving
distributions from General Indemnity Escrow Account.

  



  

9.4 _Right of Set Off_.

  



  

In addition to its rights against the General Indemnity Escrow, if prior to
the Survival Date, FSAC makes one or more claims under Section 9.2(b)
that are in excess of the then balance of the General Indemnity Escrow and
there remain funds due under the Earn Out then, payments of the Earn Out
otherwise due the Founders can be withheld until those claims are resolved
pursuant to Section 11.11 and if resolved in favor of FSAC can be set off
against and satisfied from payment of the Earn Out that have been held
pursuant to this Section 9.4 that are to be subsequently paid. Any portion of
the Earn Out that is withheld by FSAC under this Section 9.4 shall be
deposited by FSAC with Escrow Agent and held by Escrow Agent in the General
Indemnity Escrow until the claims giving rise to the offset are resolved
pursuant to Section 11.11.

  



  

9.5 _Effect of Investigation_.

  



  

The right to indemnification or other remedies based on any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Shareholders or ATS
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date
occurs, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any
condition to the obligation of FSAC to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, where such condition is based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, shall not affect the right to indemnification or
other remedies based on such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation.

(d) by the Shareholders, if there has been a material violation or breach by

(a) FSAC shall upon written request from the Shareholders return all
documents, work papers and other materials (and all copies thereof) obtained
from the Shareholders or ATS relating to the transactions contemplated

(c) The obligations provided for in this Section 10.2, Sections 5.2 and 5.7,
and in the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination of
this Agreement; and

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from liability for
willful breach of this Agreement.

  



  

 **ARTICLE XI** 
  _Miscellaneous_

  



  

11.1 _Further Assurances_.

  



  

At any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, the Shareholders,

transmission and shall be effective upon receipt, provided that notices shall
be presumed to have been received:

  



  

(a) if given by courier service, on the second Business Day following
delivery of the notice to a recognized courier service before the
deadline for delivery on or before the second Business Day following delivery
to such service, delivery costs prepaid, addressed as aforesaid; and

  



  

(b) if given by facsimile transmission, on the next Business Day, _provided_
that the facsimile transmission is confirmed by answer back, written evidence
of electronic confirmation of delivery, or oral or written acknowledgment of
receipt thereof by the addressee.

  



  

From time to time, either party may designate a new address or facsimile
number for the purpose of notice hereunder by notice to the other party in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.2.

  



  

11.3 _Governing Law_.

  



  

This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws (excluding conflict of laws rules and principles)
of the Commonwealth of Virginia applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely within the Commonwealth of Virginia, including all matters
of construction, validity and performance.

  



  

11.4 _Entire Agreement_.

  



  

This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the
other Transaction Documents, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior contracts or
agreements, whether oral or written. There are no representations,
agreements, arrangements or understandings, oral or written, between or among
the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement that are not
fully expressed in this Agreement.

  



  

11.5 _Severability_.

  



  

Should any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance be held invalid or unenforceable to any extent: (a)
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, and only to the extent, of
such unenforceability or prohibition and shall be enforced to the greatest
extent permitted by Law; (b) such unenforceability or prohibition in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
as applied (i) to other

  



        
   

  



  

persons or circumstances or (ii) in any other jurisdiction; and (c) such
unenforceability or prohibition shall not affect or invalidate any other
provision of this Agreement.

  



  

11.6 _Amendment_.

  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated,
amended, supplemented or modified orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which the enforcement of the termination,
amendment, supplement, or modification shall be sought.

  



  

11.7 _Effect of Waiver or Consent_.

  



  

No waiver or consent, express or implied, by any person to or of any breach
or default by any party in the performance by such party of its
obligations hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver
to or of any other breach or default in the performance by such party of the
same or any other obligations of such party hereunder. No single or partial
exercise of any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps
to enforce any right or power, shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. Failure on the part of a
party to complain of any act of any party or to declare any party in
default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not
constitute a waiver by such person of its rights hereunder until the
applicable statute of limitation period has run.

  



  

11.8 _Rights and Remedies Cumulative_.

  



  

(a) Except where other remedies are expressly provided herein,
indemnifications under ARTICLE IX shall constitute the sole remedy for Losses
identifiable pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(i), 9.2(b)(i), or 9.2(b)(iii) except
with respect to fraud or intentional misconduct by a party. To the extent
this Agreement provides for other remedies in addition to the
indemnifications under ARTICLE IX, then such other remedies together with
indemnifications under ARTICLE IX shall be cumulative, and the use of any one
such right or remedy by any party shall not preclude or waive the right to
use any or all other such remedies.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the
avoidance of doubt, and in addition to any other limitations on liability in
this Agreement, in no event shall Harry Katrivanos have any liability under
or pursuant to this Agreement except with respect to his individual
representations and warranties under Sections 3.1(a) (Organization and
Power), 3.2(b) (Authorization and Enforceability), 3.3(b) (No Violation),
3.4(b) (Consents), 3.11(a) (Title to Shares), 3.32(b) (Powers of Attorney)
and 3.33(b) (No Broker), and his covenants and obligations set forth in
Sections 5.3 (Best Efforts), 5.12 (Public Announcements) and 5.15(a)
(Notification of Certain Matters).

  



  

11.9 _Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others_.

  



  

The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors
and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall
be construed to give any person (other than the

  



        
   

  



  

parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and
assigns and as expressly provided herein and to the extent provided in
ARTICLE IX, the Indemnified Parties) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or
provisions contained herein, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise.

  



  

11.10 _Assignability_.

  



  

This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party hereto without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto, _provided, however_ , that the
prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative shall not be
required with respect to (a) any assignment by FSAC of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate of FSAC so long as such
assignment does not relieve FSAC of its obligations hereunder; or (b) any
collateral assignment of FSACs rights and remedies under this Agreement to
any lender under credit and collateral agreements, as such agreements may be
amended, modified or replaced from time to time, so long as such lender does
not have the right to exercise any of FSACs rights and remedies under this
Agreement in the absence a default by FSAC under the applicable credit and
collateral documents. Each of the Shareholders hereby agrees to execute and
deliver (and authorize the Shareholders Representative to execute and
deliver) such documents, instruments and agreements as such lender may
reasonably require to confirm, reaffirm or perfect such collateral
assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

  



  

11.11 _Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_.

  



  

In the event that any dispute arises among the parties pertaining to the
subject matter of this Agreement, and the parties, through the senior
management of FSAC and the Shareholders Representative, are unable to
resolve such dispute within a reasonable time through negotiations and
mediation efforts, such dispute shall be resolved as set forth in this
Section 11.11.

  



  

(a) The procedures of this Section 11.11 may be initiated by a written notice
(" _Dispute Notice_ ") given by one party (" _Claimant_ ") to the other, but
not before thirty (30) days have passed during which the parties have been
unable to reach a resolution as described (unless any party would be
materially prejudiced by such delay). The Dispute Notice shall be accompanied
by (i) a statement of the Claimant describing the dispute in reasonable
detail and (ii) documentation, if any, supporting the Claimants position on
the dispute. Within twenty (20) days after the other partys (" _Respondent_
") receipt of the Dispute Notice and accompanying materials, the parties
shall submit the dispute to mediation in the Washington, D.C. area under the
rules of the American Arbitration Association. All negotiations and mediation
procedures pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall be confidential and treated
as compromise and settlement negotiations and shall not be admissible in any
arbitration or other proceeding.

  



  

(b) If the dispute is not resolved as provided in paragraph (a) within sixty
(60) days after the Respondents receipt of the Dispute Notice, the dispute
shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Within the sixty-day period
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, the parties shall agree on
a single arbitrator to resolve the dispute. If the parties fail to agree on
the designation of an arbitrator within said sixty-day period, the American
Arbitration

  



        
   

  



  

Association in the Washington, D.C. area shall be requested to designate the
single arbitrator. If the arbitrator becomes disabled, resigns or is
otherwise unable to discharge the arbitrators duties, the arbitrators
successor shall be appointed in the same manner as the arbitrator was
appointed.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11.11, the arbitration shall
be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, which shall be governed by the United States
Arbitration Act.

  



  

(d) Any resolution reached through mediation and any award arising out of
arbitration (i) shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties; (ii) shall
be limited to a holding for or against a party, and affording such monetary
remedy as is deemed equitable, just and within the scope of this Agreement;
(iii) may not include special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages;
(iv) may in appropriate circumstances include injunctive relief; and (v) may
be entered in court in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act.

  



  

(e) Arbitration shall not be deemed a waiver of any right of termination
under this Agreement, and the arbitrator is not empowered to act or make any
award other than based solely on the rights and obligations of the parties
prior to termination in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(f) The arbitrator may not limit, expand, or otherwise modify the terms of
this Agreement.

  



  

(g) The laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall apply to any mediation,
arbitration, or litigation arising under this Agreement.

  



  

(h) Each party shall bear its own expenses incurred in any mediation,
arbitration or litigation, but any expenses related to the compensation and
the costs of any mediator or arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties
to the dispute.

  



  

(i) A request by a party to a court for interim measures necessary to
preserve a partys rights and remedies for resolution pursuant to this
Section 11.11 shall not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to mediate or of
the agreement to arbitrate.

  



  

(j) The parties, their representatives, other participants and the mediator
or arbitrator shall hold the existence, content and result of mediation or
arbitration in confidence.

  



  

11.12 _Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

Subject to the provisions of Section 11.11, any suit, action or proceeding
against any party to this Agreement arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be brought in any Federal or state court located in the
Commonwealth of Virginia and each of the parties hereby submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any such suit,
action or proceeding. A final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. To the extent that service
of process by mail is permitted by applicable Law, each party irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding in
such courts by the mailing of such process by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, at its

  



        
   

  



  

address for notices provided for herein. Each party irrevocably agrees not to
assert (a) any objection that it may ever have to the laying of venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any Federal or state court located in the
Commonwealth of Virginia and (b) any claim that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each party waives any right to a trial by jury, to the extent lawful.

  



  

11.13 _No Other Duties_.

  



  

The only duties and obligations of the parties are as specifically set forth
in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations shall be implied in
fact, law or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary obligation.

  



  

11.14 _Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors_.

  



  

Each party has consulted such legal, financial, technical or other expert as
it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this Agreement. Each
party represents and warrants that it has read, knows, understands and agrees
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

11.15 _Waiver of Rights Against Company s Trust Fund_.

  



  

ATS and each of the Shareholders acknowledges that they have read FSACs
Final Prospectus, dated October 19, 2005 ("Prospectus") and understands
that FSAC has established a trust fund, initially in an amount of
$117,180,000, for the benefit of FSACs public stockholders and that FSAC may
disburse monies from the trust fund only (a) to FSACs public stockholders in
the event such stockholders elect to convert their shares, (b) to
FSACs public stockholders upon its liquidation if FSAC fails to consummate a
business combination or (c) after or concurrently with the consummation of
a business combination. ATS and each of the Shareholders (i) hereby
agrees that from the period commencing from the Effective Date through the
Closing he, she or it do not have any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind in or to any monies in the trust fund for so long as they have not been
distributed or required to be distributed and (ii) will not seek recourse
against monies in the trust fund consistent with clause (i) of this sentence.
This Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement but shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect upon Closing.

  



  

11.16 _Counterparts_.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, all of which
taken together shall be deemed one and constitute a single instrument. Any
manual signature upon this Agreement that is faxed, scanned or photocopied
shall for all purposes have the same validity effect and admissibility in
evidence as an original signature and the parties hereby waive any objection
to the contrary.
