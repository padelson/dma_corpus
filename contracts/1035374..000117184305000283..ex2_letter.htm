Re: Letter of Intent 
 \t\t

 \t\t

Dear Mr. Thompson: 
 \t\t

 \t\t

This letter of intent will evidence our discussions regarding the interest of
Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, Inc., or an affiliate (" _Investor_ "), in
purchasing all of the outstanding common stock (other than shares held by the
Rollover Shareholders referred to below) of Fox and Hound Restaurant Group ("
_Fox and Hound_" or the " _Company_ ") for $14.00 per share in cash, subject to
the terms and conditions of this letter of intent. To consummate the
transaction contemplated herein, Investor shall form a new entity ("Newco") to
merge into Fox and Hound with the Company surviving the merger (the "Merger").

 \t\t

The following table shows the anticipated sources and uses for the transaction
contemplated herein.

Delivered with this letter is a "Highly Confident" letter with respect to the
placement of the Senior Facility (the " _Highly Confident Letter_ ") issued by
Libra Securities, LLC (" _Libra Securities_ "). As part of the transaction,
Investor will require that certain shareholders including certain management
shareholders (collectively, the " _Rollover Shareholders_ ") exchange
approximately 1.24 million shares of common stock and/or options of the
Company (collectively the " _Rollover Shares_ ") for shares of the post-merger
company having the equivalent value of $17.4 million. Investor will require
that, at the time of signing the definitive merger agreement, the Rollover
Shareholders enter into customary voting and lock-up agreements pursuant to
which, among other things, the Rollover Shareholders shall agree to vote all
the Rollover Shares in favor of the Merger.

 \t\t

_1\. Due Diligence._ Immediately following the execution of this letter of
intent by the Company, Investor will commence its due diligence investigation
of the Company and its subsidiaries and other affiliates (collectively
referred to as the " _Companies_ "). The due diligence investigation will
include, but not be limited to, a review of the Companies\' business,
operations, prospects, properties (including all of their assets) and
condition (financial and otherwise). The Companies shall provide Investor,
potential senior lenders and their representatives access, on a timely basis,
to all books, records, accounts, material agreements (including, without
limitation, leases), personnel information (including background information
and references), suppliers, facilities and proprietary information of the
Companies, as well as the opportunity to discuss directly with senior
management and other personnel the Companies\' operations and related business
and financial matters. Investor anticipates that its due diligence
investigation shall be completed (assuming timely responses and complete
cooperation by the Companies) no later than November 3, 2005. Additionally,
Investor currently anticipates that the senior lenders can complete their due
diligence investigation with respect to the Senior Facility on or prior to
December 2, 2005.

 \t\t

_2\. Conditions to Closing; Definitive Agreements_. In addition to customary
closing conditions for transactions of this type, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this letter of intent is subject to (i) the
negotiation, execution and delivery of definitive documentation, including (w)
a securities purchase agreement with respect to the Investor Capital, (x) a
definitive merger agreement (or similar agreement) with the Company, the
Rollover Shareholders, Investor and Newco (the " _Definitive Merger Agreement_
"), which shall contain provisions substantially similar to those contained
herein relating to Alternative Third Party Proposals (as defined in paragraph
4(b)) and an Alternative Transaction Fee (as defined in paragraph 4(c)), (y)
definitive voting and lock-up, shareholder and other equity-related agreements
with the Rollover Shareholders, and (z) the Senior Facility documents, each
containing terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the parties thereto,
(ii) satisfactory completion of Investor\'s and the senior lenders\' business
and legal due diligence investigation, (iii) the funding of the Senior
Facility and (iv) the absence of any material adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise), business, operations, properties or prospects of the
Companies since December 31, 2004. The parties will use their reasonable best
efforts to negotiate, execute and deliver definitive documents by December 2,
2005 and to close the transaction by February 28, 2006, it being understood
that the final closing date shall occur as soon as practicable after Investor
and the senior lender have received all necessary consents, authorizations and
approvals (including early termination of the waiting period in connection
with an HSR filing, if needed) and the Company has received the requisite
approval of its shareholders.

 \t\t

_3\. Public Statements; Confidentiality_. Until consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as required by applicable law or
regulatory authority, none of the Companies or any of their respective
shareholders, officers, directors, affiliates, representatives, investment
bankers (including North Point Advisors, LLC (" _NPA_ ")), business brokers or
agents nor Investor or any of its shareholders, officers, directors,
affiliates, representatives, investment bankers, business brokers or agents,
in each case without the prior consent of Investor and the Company,
respectively, will disclose to any other person (other than the Company\'s and
Investor\'s advisors, accountants, lawyers and other professionals who are
involved in the transaction contemplated herein), (i) the fact that
discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction
between the Company and Investor or (ii) any of the terms or conditions
contained in this letter of intent or the definitive documents, or discussed
or proposed in negotiations between the Company and the Investor after the
date hereof. All information exchanged by the parties in connection with the
due diligence investigation and the negotiation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the terms of this letter
of intent and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 23, 2005, between the
Investor and NPA. Any disclosure that the Board of Directors (as defined in
paragraph 4(b)) is required to make by law or regulatory authority will not
constitute a violation of this letter of intent.

 \t\t

_4\. Exclusivity_. (a) In consideration of the capital and other resources
(human or otherwise) committed and to be committed to Investor\'s due
diligence investigation of the Companies and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this letter of intent, during the Effective
Period (as defined in paragraph 8), the Company will not, nor will it permit
any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders, members, directors,
officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers (including
NPA), business brokers, representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly,
initiate contact with, or solicit, consider, encourage or make any inquiries
or proposals from or to, or furnish any information regarding the Companies or
their businesses or assets to, or engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, any person or entity with respect to any proposal pursuant
to which any of the Companies would (i) obtain any debt or equity capital,
(ii) be acquired, whether through a purchase, merger, tender offer,
consolidation or other business combination, (iii) sell all or a substantial
part of the assets of any of the Companies or their businesses or (iv) enter
into any transaction or arrangement or otherwise approve any transaction
pursuant to which any third party would acquire beneficial ownership
(determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
and the related rules thereunder) of more than 10% of the outstanding common
stock of any Company. Any transaction referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) above is referred to as an " _Alternative Transaction_ ". The Company
will promptly communicate to Investor the fact that it has received any
proposal or inquiry regarding any Alternative Transaction, whether in writing
or otherwise. In addition, concurrent with the execution of this letter of
intent, the Company shall terminate all discussion with other parties
concerning an Alternative Transaction.

 \t\t

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is in compliance with the
provisions of paragraph 4 and it receives an unsolicited bona fide proposal
from a third party regarding any Alternative Transaction (an " _Alternative
Third Party Proposal_ "), the Company may consider such proposal, engage and
participate in discussions or negotiations with such third party regarding
such Alternative Third Party Proposal and furnish information regarding the
Companies or their businesses or assets to such third party in connection
therewith; _provided_ that the Company complies with the provisions of this
paragraph 4(b). Within one day following the date on which the Company is
aware that it has received an Alternative Third Party Proposal, the Company
shall deliver to Investor a copy of such proposal if such proposal is written
or a summary of the principal terms of such proposal if such proposal is not
written. Within five business days following receipt of an Alternative Third
Party Proposal, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of
Directors_ ") shall determine in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with its independent financial advisor) whether the Alternative Third Party
Proposal is more favorable than the transaction with Investor contemplated by
this letter of intent (in which case, such Alternative Third Party Proposal
shall be a " _Superior Proposal_ "). In the event that the Board of Directors
determines that such Alternative Third Party Proposal is a Superior Proposal,
the Company shall promptly (but in any event within one day) notify Investor
in writing of such determination and of any changes to the Alternative Third
Party Proposal that were not reflected in the original written notice to
Investor. No later than five business days following the date on which
Investor receives notice of such determination, Investor shall notify the
Company either that (i) it wishes to match the terms of the Alternative Third
Party Proposal or (ii) it wishes to modify the terms of the transaction
contemplated herein and shall specify such modified terms. If Investor matches
the terms of the Alternative Third Party Proposal, the Company shall terminate
all negotiations with such third party and shall proceed with Investor on the
basis of such terms. If Investor modifies the terms of the transaction
contemplated herein but does not match the terms of the Alternative Third
Party Proposal, then within five business days thereafter, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall determine whether the Alternative Third Party
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal relative to the modified terms
proposed by Investor and shall promptly notify Investor in writing of its
decision. If (i) Investor fails to match the terms of the Alternative Third
Party Proposal or modify the terms of the transaction contemplated hereby or
(ii) Investor modifies the terms of the transaction contemplated hereby and
the Board of Directors of the Company determines that the Alternative Third
Party Proposal is still a Superior Proposal, either the Company or Investor
may terminate this letter of intent as provided in paragraph 8(c). If the
Company determines that the Alternative Third Party Proposal is not a Superior
Proposal, then the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one day)
deliver to the third party making the Alternative Third Party Proposal a
written notice terminating all negotiations with such third party and shall
deliver a copy of such notice to Investor. If the Company fails to make a
determination that the Alternative Third Party Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal within the time frames set forth herein, then it shall be deemed to
have determined that such Alternative Third Party Proposal does not constitute
a Superior Proposal.

 \t\t

After receipt by Investor of notice from the Company that it has received an
Alternative Third Party Proposal, Investor may at its option and in its sole
discretion cease its due diligence investigation until such time as the
Company notifies Investor that it is not proceeding with the Alternative Third
Party Proposal. Upon written notice by Investor to the Company of such
cessation, all estimated time periods set forth in this letter of intent and
the date set forth in paragraph 8 shall automatically be deemed to be extended
by the same number of business days as were included in the period from and
including the date of such written notice by Investor to the Company to and
including the date Investor received written notice that the Company is not
proceeding with the Alternative Third Party Proposal.

 \t\t

(c) If (i) this letter of intent is terminated by either the Company or
Investor pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph 8 in connection with an
Alternative Third Party Proposal, or (ii) this letter of intent is terminated
for any reason (other than as provided in this paragraph 4(c)) and within
three months after such termination, any of the Companies enters into an
agreement or understanding with a third party relating to an Alternative
Transaction or (iii) prior to the termination of this letter of intent, any of
the Companies enters into an agreement or understanding with a third party
relating to an Alternative Transaction and at such time after giving effect to
such agreement or understanding the Company is in breach of the terms of
paragraph 4(a) or paragraph 4(b), then (in lieu of any damages due to Investor
for breach of this letter of intent by the Company) the Company shall be
liable and pay to Investor the amount of $5,000,000 (the " _Alternative
Transaction Fee_ "), which Alternative Transaction Fee shall be due and
payable to Investor in cash immediately upon the occurrence of the event
described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above as applicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company will not be obligated to pay Investor the
Alternative Transaction Fee if Investor terminates this letter of intent as a
result of its decision not to proceed with this transaction based solely upon
the matters described in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the penultimate sentence of
paragraph 8.

 \t\t

_5\. Conduct of the Business During the Effective Period._ During the
Effective Period, the Companies shall not, without prior written notice to
Investor, except as required by applicable law or regulatory authority, (i)
make any change in its authorized capital stock, or amend its charter or
bylaws, (ii) issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for its capital stock, other than the
granting of stock options and warrants to employees in the ordinary course of
business and the issuance of stock upon exercise of options or warrants, (iii)
form, create or dissolve any subsidiary, (iv) purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire for consideration any shares of its capital stock or the capital stock
of any other entity except as required by any existing employment arrangements
or compensation plans, (v) declare, pay or set aside with respect to its
capital stock any dividend or other distribution or payment, (vi) increase the
level of compensation of any officer or key employee except in the ordinary
course of business or as required by any existing employment arrangements or
compensation plans, (vii) adopt any new employee benefit plan or amend any
existing employee benefit plan, except as required to grant options or
warrants in the ordinary course of business or in connection with stay bonus
or retention arrangements approved by the Board of Directors in an aggregate
amount to be reasonably agreed upon by the parties, (viii) enter into any new
employment or consulting agreements except for new employees in the ordinary
course of business or in connection with stay bonus or retention arrangements
approved by the Board of Directors (subject to the limitation on aggregate
payments set forth in (vii) above), (ix) other than capital expenditures in
connection with expansion plans that were approved by the Board of Directors
prior to the date hereof, make capital expenditures in excess of $500,000 or
sell any assets outside of the ordinary course of business, (x) incur any
indebtedness for borrowed money other than under the Company\'s currently
existing credit lines in the ordinary course of business, (xii) engage in any
related party transactions or transactions with affiliates other than existing
arrangements in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices, (xiii) fail to use its commercially reasonable effort to operate
its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practices or (xiv)
fail to maintain its books and records consistent with past practices.

 \t\t

_6\. Costs and Expenses._ Simultaneously with the signing of the Definitive
Merger Agreement, the Company shall reimburse the Investor in cash for up to a
maximum of $500,000 of all documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses
(other than Senior Lender Expenses (defined below)) incurred by Investor
relating to the transactions described herein, including, without limitation,
the documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses relating to lien
searches, filing fees, due diligence, accounting services, legal services,
administration of the credit relationship, interpretation or enforcement of
Investor\'s rights, and the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of definitive documentation (" _Investor Expenses_ "). After the execution of
a Definitive Merger Agreement, then the Company shall reimburse Investor
promptly for up to a maximum of $1,000,000 (the " _Aggregate Reimbursement
Cap_ ") of Investor Expenses, inclusive of any amounts previously reimbursed
to Investor pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, within five
business days after termination of the Definitive Merger Agreement due to (a)
the Company\'s shareholders voting against approval of the transactions
contemplated by the Definitive Merger Agreement, (b) the occurrence of a
material adverse change with respect to the Companies, (c) the Board of
Directors\' failure to recommend the transactions contemplated by the
Definitive Merger Agreement to the Company\'s shareholders or withdrawal of
such recommendation, (d) the failure by Investor to finance the transaction
contemplated by the Definitive Merger Agreement and the failure by the Company
to achieve minimum fourth quarter 2005 and, if applicable, first quarter 2006
EBITDA levels to be agreed upon, which minimum levels will be consistent with
the financial information provided by the Company to Investor prior to the
date hereof or (e) any material breach by the Company of its representations
and warranties in the Definitive Merger Agreement. In addition and without
being applied against the reimbursement caps set forth previously in this
paragraph, upon and after the execution of a Definitive Merger Agreement, the
Company shall promptly upon request either pay directly to the senior lenders
under the Senior Facility or reimburse Investor for any fees, costs and
expenses payable to the senior lenders or incurred by Investor in connection
with or related to the Senior Facility (the " _Senior Lender Expenses_ "),
regardless of whether the Senior Facility is completed or closed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall have no obligation to pay or reimburse
Senior Lender Expenses in an aggregate amount in excess of $300,000. If Senior
Lender Expenses exceed $300,000 and Investor pays such excess amounts, the
Company shall be required to reimburse Investor for such payments provided
that such obligation shall be subject to, and be applied without duplication
against, the Aggregate Reimbursement Cap. Investor agrees to promptly
reimburse the Company for any monies returned to Investor (which had been
advanced by the Company on behalf of Investor or reimbursed to Investor) that
are Senior Lender Expenses to the extent that Investor receives these monies
pursuant to the documentation executed with any senior lender thereto. Upon
closing of the transaction contemplated by the Definitive Merger Agreement,
the Company will reimburse Investor for all Investor Expenses and Senior
Lender Expenses without regard to the reimbursement caps described above.
Except as expressly provided herein, each party shall be responsible for and
pay the fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party in connection with the
negotiation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 \t\t

_7\. Binding Effect; Entire Agreement._ The parties acknowledge and agree that
this letter of intent is intended as a non-binding statement of their mutual
intention to negotiate a transaction on the terms described herein and that
except for their agreements in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12,
and this paragraph 7, which shall be binding in accordance with their terms,
neither party shall be under any obligation to the other unless and until the
parties execute and deliver definitive documents with respect to the
transaction contemplated hereby. This letter of intent contains the entire
understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to the transactions
described herein and supersedes all prior oral or written, and all
contemporaneous oral, understandings or agreements with respect to the
transactions described herein, including the letter for Investor to the
Company dated September 15, 2005.

 \t\t

_8\. Term and Termination._ The term of this letter of intent shall commence
on the date Investor shall have received the written acceptance of this letter
of intent from the Company and shall end on the earlier to occur of (i) the
execution of a Definitive Merger Agreement by all parties thereto and (ii) the
date this letter of intent is terminated pursuant to this paragraph 8 (the "
_Effective Period_ "). This letter of intent may be terminated by (a) either
party by giving written notice of termination to the other party at any time
after January 31, 2006 (which termination shall be effective as of the date of
receipt of such written notice); (b) either party upon 20 business days\'
written notice of a breach by the other party, which breach is not cured
within such 20-business-day period; (c) either party if the Board of Directors
determines, after compliance with all of the provisions set forth in paragraph
4(b) hereof, that an Alternative Third Party Proposal is a Superior Proposal;
or (d) the Company if Libra Securities withdraws the Highly Confident Letter
and the Highly Confident Letter has not been replaced within ten-business days
by another "Highly Confident" letter with respect to the placement of the
Senior Facility by a financial institution, in each case reasonably
satisfactory to the Company. In addition, Investor shall have the sole right
to terminate this letter of intent at any time upon written notice to the
Company if (x) it decides, in its sole discretion, not to proceed with the
transactions contemplated herein based upon the results of its due diligence
investigation of the Companies or (y) any event or circumstance occurs which,
individually or together with any other event or circumstance, has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse change or (z) the
United States shall have become involved in a war or there is an outbreak or
escalation of major hostilities involving the United States, or there occurs
any other substantial domestic or international calamity or terrorist attack
or crisis or change in economic conditions or in the financial markets of the
United States which, in the good faith judgment of Investor, is material and
adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the
transaction contemplated herein. A termination of this letter of intent shall
not affect the obligations of the parties under paragraphs 3, 4(c) (but only
to the extent that the Company may be obligated to pay the Alternative
Transaction Fee in accordance with the express terms of this letter of
intent), 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12, each of which shall survive such termination in
accordance with their terms.

 \t\t

_9\. Governing Law; Counterparts_. This letter of intent shall be governed by,
and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State
of California, without regard to its conflicts of law or choice of law
principles. This letter of intent may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by facsimile, all of which taken together shall be one and
the same instrument.

 \t\t

_10\. No Third Party Beneficiaries; Indemnification._ This letter of intent is
solely for the benefit of the Company and no third parties (including, but not
limited to, the shareholders and creditors of the Company) shall be entitled
to rely upon anything contained herein as a third party beneficiary or
otherwise. Neither party shall be responsible or otherwise liable to any
person for any indirect, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary
damages, or claims of lost profits, which may arise, or be alleged to arise,
as a result of this letter of intent or the transactions contemplated hereby,
or for any damages which may be alleged as a result of such party\'s failure
or refusal, in accordance with the terms of this letter of intent, to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein. For avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this paragraph 10 shall be deemed to prevent the payment of the
Alternative Transaction Fee as provided in paragraph 4(c) or the reimbursement
and payment of fees, costs and expenses as provided in paragraph 6.

 \t\t

_11\. Representations and Warranties._ In order to induce Investor to enter
into this letter of intent, the Company represents and warrants to, and
covenants with, Investor that:

 \t\t

>  \t\t\t
>
> (a) The documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
> Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as
> amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
> as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), together taken as whole (the " _SEC
> Filings_ "), as of the date hereof do not contain an untrue statement of a
> material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
> statements contained therein not misleading;
>
>  \t\t\t
>
> (b) this letter of intent has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
> by the Company.
>
>  \t\t

 \t\t

If the Company is informed or otherwise learns that the SEC Filings and any
other information delivered to Investor by or on behalf of any of the
Companies taken as a whole (the "Disclosed Information") contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to
make the Disclosed Information not misleading, the Company will (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts if applicable to amend the SEC Filings or
otherwise make a filing with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act promptly such that the SEC Filings as so amended will not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading and will
provide Investor with a copy of such amendment or other filing on the date of
such amendment or filing and (ii) promptly inform Investor in writing of such
untrue statement or omission in the Disclosed Information. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that Investor may use and rely upon such Disclosed
Information without independent verification thereof. 
 \t\t

 \t\t

_12\. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ (a) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY

TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LETTER OF INTENT, THE
PREPARATION, NEGOTIATION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS LETTER OF INTENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY INITIATES THE
ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM. 
 \t\t

 \t\t

_(b) DISPUTE RESOLUTION._ IN THE EVENT THAT THE WAIVER IN SUBPARAGRAPH (A)

THE AAA RULES THEN IN EFFECT, AND JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED IN SUCH
ARBITRATION WILL BE BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING

ATTORNEY\'S FEES, COSTS, AND NECESSARY DISBURSEMENTS IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER
RELIEF TO WHICH SUCH PARTY MAY BE ENTITLED. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT CONSENTS TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT OR
