 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, Parent and VGG Holding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is entering into a voting and support agreement (the " _Support Agreement_ "), the form of which is attached hereto as Annex A.

of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate
existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue under the DGCL unaffected by the Merger, except
as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  

    
 1.2 _ Closing. _ Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Schulte Roth and Zabel LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the third (3rd) business day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized by Law or executive order to close in New York, New York or London, England. 

  

    
 1.3 _ Effective Time. _ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by causing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings, recordings or publications required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with, and accepted for record      

by, the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the DGCL, or at such later time or date as the Company and
Parent shall agree in writing and specify in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with applicable Law (the effective time of the Merger being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (subject to Section 6.12).

  

    
 2.2 _ The Bylaws. _ The by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (subject to Section 6.12).

ARTICLE IV 

  

  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

    4.1 _ Effect on Capital Stock. _ At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Merger Sub, the holder of any capital stock of the Company or the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub:

  

  

 (a) _ Merger Consideration._ Each share (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including each outstanding restricted share granted under the Stock Plan) other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined below), and (iii) Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (each Share referred to in clause (i) through (iii) above being an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $10.50 in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to 

  

      

  

exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares and shall represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of such
Shares formerly represented thereby, without interest.

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Excluded Shares._ Each Excluded Share, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder of any Dissenting Shares to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f) with respect to such Dissenting Shares. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Record Holder_ " means, with respect to any Shares, a Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of record of such Shares. 

  

 (c) _ Merger Sub._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, any certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

  

    
 4.2 _ Payment. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company\'s prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Record Holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make the aggregate payments under Section 4.1(a) for the Shares other than the Excluded Shares (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If a Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its, appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall, reasonably promptly thereafter, make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its, appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent (at Parent\'s election). To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments such that the Exchange Fund diminishes below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such aggregate payments under Section 4.1(a). 

  

      

  

 (b) _ Payment Procedures._ 

    

 (i) _ Letter of Transmittal._ Reasonably promptly (and in any event, within three (3) business days) after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (x) a letter of transmittal for use in collecting the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger, such letter of transmittal to be in such customary form as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

  

 (ii) _ Payment for Shares._ Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent by any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with its instructions, and surrender to the Paying Agent of the Certificate (if any) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)), such Record Holder shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Fund a cash amount equal to the number of such Shares multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration, and, if applicable, the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable as provided above. Risk of loss of and title to any Certificate will pass only upon proper delivery as provided above. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance with the procedures described above may be issued to the transferee if the applicable letter of transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The Per Share Merger Consideration, paid in full with respect to any Share in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Share. 

  

 (iii) _ Special Payment Procedures for DTC._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to establish customary procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (x) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash from the Exchange Fund in immediately available funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (y) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first business day after the Closing Date an amount in cash from the Exchange Fund in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment. 

    

 (c) _ Transfers._ From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Person presents to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying Agent any Certificates or any transfer instructions relating to Shares cancelled in the Merger, such Person shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal and related instructions referred to in Section 4.2(b)(i) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this Article IV. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the Record Holders of Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied 

  

      

  

with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) for payment of the
Per Share Merger Consideration for such Shares upon compliance with the
instructions in the form of letter of transmittal referred to in Section
4.2(b)(i), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. If any Shares shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to the date on which any cash payable in respect of such
Shares would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such cash shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature, and
any permitted successors and assigns of such Person.

  

 (e) _ Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (satisfactory to the Paying Agent, acting reasonably) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by the Paying Agent or Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount equal to the number of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (f) _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares included in clauses (i) and (iii) of the definition of Excluded Shares) and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost its right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder\'s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with Section 4.1(a), without interest. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice and a copy of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to Company stockholders\' rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal by Company stockholders under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (g) _ Withholding Rights._ Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of Shares cancelled in the Merger such amounts as it reasonably believes it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be (i) timely remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Record Holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

  

    
 4.3 _ Restricted Stock Units. _ At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted under the Stock Plan (an " _RSU_ ") and each performance restricted stock unit granted under the Stock Plan (a " _PRSU_ "), in each case that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall fully vest and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such RSU or PRSU, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment; _provided_ , that, with respect to the PRSUs, the total number of Shares subject thereto for purposes of this sentence shall be equal to the sum of (i) the accrued and "banked" shares plus (ii) the number of shares subject to the current fiscal year and prospective fiscal years assuming achievement of the applicable performance goals at the one-hundred percent (100%) level. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board (or another committee duly authorized by the Company Board for such purpose), as applicable, shall (i) adopt any resolutions as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this Section 4.3 and (ii) if requested by Parent, adopt any resolutions as may be necessary to terminate the Stock Plan, effective as of the Effective Time, and (iii) if determined by Parent in good faith to be necessary to effectuate the treatment set forth herein, use reasonable best efforts to obtain the written consent of each holder of a RSU or PRSU to the treatment set forth herein; _provided_ that the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable advance opportunity to review any resolutions or other documents in respect of the actions described in this sentence and will implement any reasonable comments that are timely provided by Parent in respect hereof. 

  

    
 4.4 _ Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. _ In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time, including as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration. Nothing in this Section 4.4 shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that (x) changes, developments, events,
circumstances, occurrences or effects set forth in clause (i)(A), (i)(B),
(ii)(A), (ii)(C) or (ii)(D) above may be taken into account in determining

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Company do not and will not require any consent, approval, authorization, declaration or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to, any federal, state, local, municipal, domestic, foreign or supranational

authorization, declaration, permit, action, filing or notification not

 (i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act from July 1, 2011 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished on or subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_ ").

required by applicable Law or by the terms of a Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and none of the Company Group
maintains, contributes to or sponsors any voluntary employees\' beneficiary
association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into
account any adjustment or revisions made by Parent in response to such
Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 6.2(d)).

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any _bona fide_ proposal or offer with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, tender offer, recapitalization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction or series of transactions involving the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the total voting power of the capital stock or other ownership interests, or more than 20% of the consolidated assets, of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) any other proposal or offer which, if consummated, would result in a direct or indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the total voting power of the capital stock or other ownership interests, or more than 20% of the consolidated assets, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in one transaction or a series of transactions, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal involving more than 50% of the total voting power of the capital stock or other ownership interests, or more than 50% of the consolidated assets, of the Company and its Subsidiaries that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors (i) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal that the Company Board deems relevant and the Person making the proposal, and (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders taking into account all relevant factors the Company Board, acting in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties, deems relevant than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any adjustment or revisions made by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 6.2(d)). 

  

 (d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.2(d), the Company Board shall not:

 (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement or a letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle with respect thereto (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(b)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); or 

   

 (iv) take any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a). 

   

      

  

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to, but not after, the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (such action or failure to act by the Company Board, a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ") and, in the event of a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board may also take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) of this Agreement in connection with accepting a Superior Proposal as contemplated herein; _provided_ that prior to any Company Change of Recommendation or action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) of this Agreement: 

    

 (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least four (4) business days in advance, of its intention to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or to take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a), which notice, if the intended Company Change of Recommendation is not the result of a Superior Proposal, shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such Change of Recommendation and, if concerning an intended Company Change of Recommendation that is the result of a Superior Proposal, shall specify the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof; 

  

 (B) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Company Change of Recommendation or taking such action pursuant to Section 8.3(a), the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company not to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or take such action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) in response to such a Superior Proposal; and 

  

 (C) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent and (x) if the intended Company Change of Recommendation is the result of a Superior Proposal, shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect and (y) if the intended Company Change of Recommendation is not the result of a Superior Proposal, shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel that failure to effect a Company Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law if such changes were to be given effect; 

    

 _provided_ that, if the intended Company Change of Recommendation is the
result of a Superior Proposal, in the event of any material revision to
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and Merger Sub and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 6.2(d) with respect to such new written notice, except that the
deadline for such new written notice shall be reduced to two (2) business days
before the Company Change of Recommendation or action pursuant to Section
8.3(a) (rather than the four (4) business days otherwise contemplated by this
Section 6.2(d)).

  

 (e) Subject to the Company\'s compliance with Section 6.2(d), nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act. 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (f) Promptly (but in any event within thirty-six (36) hours) after the taking of any of the actions referred to in Section 6.2(b), the Company shall (i) notify Parent that it has provided any nonpublic information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) notify Parent it has entered or intends to enter into discussions or negotiations or waive any prohibition with respect to submission of Acquisition Proposals (or amendments thereto) as provided in Section 6.2(b) and (iii) provide to Parent a copy of any documents relating to any Acquisition Proposal delivered to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the identity of the party or parties making such Acquisition Proposal.

The Company hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement that prohibits or restricts it from providing to Parent the information contemplated by this Section 6.2(f) or complying with Section 6.2(d).

 9.8 _ No Third Party Beneficiaries. _ This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section 6.12, and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of Record Holders to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration set forth in Article IV. Except as provided above in this Section 9.8 or as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section 6.12, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person (including any Person claiming any rights arising from or through the parties hereto) other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties and covenants set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under clause (b) of this Section 9.8 and Section 6.12 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

   

    
 9.9 _ Obligations of Parent and of the Company. _ Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

   

    
 9.10 _ Transfer Taxes. _ All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due.

 9.12 _ Severability. _ The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

 9.13 _ Interpretation; Construction. _ 

  

  

 (a) The table of contents, Annex C and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." 

  

      

  

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Each party here has or may have set forth information in its respective Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such terms. 

  

  

    
 9.14 _ Assignment. _ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all of its rights, interest and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and Parent and Merger Sub may so assign to any parties providing debt financing to the Surviving Corporation for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of such debt financing, but no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Parent shall cause Merger Sub, and any assignee thereof, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and shall be responsible for any failure of Merger Sub or such assignee to comply with any representation, warranty, covenant or other provision required to be performed on or prior to the Closing, under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. 

  

    
 9.15 _ No Recourse. _ This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto (including any third party beneficiaries hereto) and none of (a) Parent\'s or any of its Affiliates\' stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, financing sources or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") or (b) the Company\'s or any of its Affiliates\' stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, financing sources or assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ "), in each case, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the other parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, except in each case as pursuant to the Support Agreement. Without limiting the rights of the parties hereunder against the other parties to the Agreement, in no event shall (i) the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the Company agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Parent Related Party, or (ii) Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, and Parent and Merger Sub agree not to and to cause their respective Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Company Related Party, except pursuant to the Support Agreement.

This Agreement shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by telecopy, facsimile, electronic mail, .pdf or otherwise as authorized by the prior sentence) to the other parties. 

  

    
 4.8 _ Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. _ This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

    
 4.9 _ Severability. _ The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

  

    
 4.10 _ Specific Performance. _ The parties hereto agree that each of Parent and Merger Sub would be irreparably damaged in the event that Stockholder or any Significant Holder fails to perform any of Stockholder\'s or a Significant Holder\'s obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Stockholder or a Significant Holder and to specific performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. 

  

    
 4.11 _ Several Liability. _ The obligations of Stockholder and each Significant Holder under this Agreement shall be several and not joint, and in no event shall a Significant Holder be liable for any breach of this Agreement by any other Significant Holder. 

  

    
 4.12 _ No Ownership Interest. _ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Subject Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall remain vested in and belong to Stockholder, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have no authority 

        

to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any
of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or
authority to direct Stockholder in the voting or disposition of any of the
Subject Shares, except as otherwise provided herein. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be interpreted as (a) obligating Stockholder to exercise any warrants,
options, conversion of convertible securities or otherwise to acquire Common
Stock; or (b) creating or forming a "group" with any other Person, including
Parent, for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) of the Exchange Act or any other
similar provision of applicable Law.

  

    
 4.13 _ No Impairment of Lender Rights. _ Each of Parent and Merger Sub agree not to bring any claim, suit,  action or any other proceeding seeking to assert that this Agreement impairs or modifies any rights or remedies of the Lender under the Loan Agreement or the Security and Pledge Agreement or otherwise applies to the Lender. 

  

    
 4.14 _ Action by Stockholder Capacity Only. _ Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that Stockholder and the Significant Holders have entered into this Agreement solely in their capacity as the record and/or beneficial owners of the Subject Shares. To the extent that any Stockholder\'s or any Significant Holder\'s Affiliate or designee is an officer or director of the Company, nothing herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by any such officer or director in their capacities as such, or require such Affiliate or designee to take any action, in each case, in such Affiliate\'s or designee\'s capacity as a director or officer of the Company, including to disclose information acquired solely in such Affiliate\'s or designee\'s capacity as a director or officer of the Company, and any actions taken (whatsoever), or failure to take any actions (whatsoever), by such Affiliate or designee in such capacity as a director or officer of the Company shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement. 

  

    
 4.15 _ Interpretation. _ Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. The definitions contained in this Agreement (including those incorporated from the Merger Agreement pursuant to the first paragraph of this Agreement) are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such terms.
