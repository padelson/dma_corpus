Notes but excluding (i) shares of Waitr Preferred Stock to be canceled

(b) _Vested Share Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective

holders of the Waitr Options, Landcadia shall assume (i) the Waitr, Inc. 2014
Stock Plan and (ii) each Vested Share Option, and upon such assumption, each
Vested Share Option shall be modified (as so modified, a " _Vested Rollover
Option_ ") so that each such Vested Rollover Option represents the right to
acquire, upon exercise of such Vested Rollover Option, in full
satisfaction of the rights of the applicable holder thereof, the Vested
Option Stock Amount. The exercise price per share of Landcadia Common Stock
with respect to the Vested Rollover Options shall be equal to the quotient
obtained by _dividing_ (i) the exercise price per share of Waitr Common Stock
of such Vested Option _by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ _, _ _however_
, the exercise price and the number of shares that may be purchased under
each such Vested Rollover Option shall be further adjusted to the extent
required to remain in compliance with, or exempt from, the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
and in the case of each option that is intended to qualify as an "incentive
stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, the exercise
price and the number of shares subject to the Vested Rollover Option shall be
adjusted in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Immediately
following the Effective Time, each Vested Rollover Option shall be deemed to
have been exercised, automatically and without any action of any party, on a
"net exercise" basis and each holder of a Vested Rollover Option shall
receive a number of shares of Landcadia Common Stock equal to the difference
between (i) the number of shares of Landcadia Common Stock subject to such
Vested Rollover Option _minus_ (ii) a number of shares of Landcadia Common
Stock equal to (A) the aggregate exercise price of such Vested Rollover
Option _divided by_ (B) the Reference Price.

  



  

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Vested Options_. Each Vested Option
that is not an In-the-Money Vested Option shall automatically, as of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, be cancelled.

  



  

(d) _Unvested Waitr Options_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, Landcadia shall assume each Waitr Option that is unvested,
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, an " _Unvested Option_ ") and each Unvested Option shall be converted
into an option under the assumed Waitr, Inc. 2014 Stock Plan to acquire a
number of whole shares of Landcadia Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) determined by _multiplying_ (A) the number of shares of Waitr
Common Stock subject to such Unvested Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time _by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of
Landcadia Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) the exercise price per share of
Waitr Common Stock of such Unvested Option _by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio, and
with the same vesting schedule to which such Unvested Option was subject as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ _, _ _however_ , that
the exercise price and the number of shares that may be purchased under each
Unvested Option shall be further adjusted to the extent required to remain in
compliance with, or exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and that each such
Unvested Option that is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section
422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the foregoing in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Parties intend that the
adjustments in this _Section 3.4(d)_  are in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(B)(5)(v)(D) and shall not subject any Unvested
Option to Section 409A.

holder thereof the Warrant Cash Amount and the Warrant Stock Amount, as set
forth on the Waitr Closing Schedule.

other cash deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any interest or
other earnings thereon shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange
Agent Fund_." The Exchange Agent Fund shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 3.7_ , as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Landcadia shall cause to be issued or paid from the
Exchange Agent Fund to each Waitr Stockholder that holds Waitr Capital Stock
(other than shares of Waitr Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section
3.3(c)_ and any Waitr Dissenting Shares), Waitr Warrant Holder and In-the-
Money Vested Option Holder, immediately prior to the Effective Time and as
set forth in the Waitr Closing Statement, (A) evidence of book-entry shares

to such Waitr Stockholder, Waitr Warrant Holder and In-the-Money Vested
Option Holder, which shares shall be subject to the Stockholder Lockup

Money Vested Option Holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
3.7(c)_ , by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account such
Waitr Stockholder identified in the Waitr Letter of Transmittal for such
Waitr Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the aggregate Cash Portion payable to the Waitr Stockholders, Waitr Warrant
Holders and In-the-Money Vested Option Holders listed on _Schedule 3.6(c)_
shall be subject to the limitations set forth on _Schedule 3.6(c)_ and, to
the extent the aggregate Cash Portion payable to such Waitr
Stockholders, Waitr Warrant Holders and In-the-Money Vested Option Holders
exceeds the limitations set forth on _Schedule 3.6(c)_ , such excess (the "
_Excess Cash Portion Amount_ ") shall be deemed not payable in cash under this
Agreement and shall be paid in shares of Landcadia Common Stock to such Waitr
Stockholders, Waitr Warrant Holders and In-the-Money Vested Option Holders in
a number equal to (i) the Excess Cash Portion Amount attributable to such
Waitr Stockholder, Waitr Warrant Holder and In-the-Money Vested Option Holder
_divided by_ (ii) the Reference Price.

  



    

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Landcadia shall not be obligated to issue shares of Landcadia Common Stock to
any Waitr Stockholder that Landcadia, in its sole discretion, does not
reasonably believe is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act (each, a " _Non-
Accredited Waitr Stockholder_ "). In lieu of issuing the shares of Landcadia
Common Stock to which such Non-Accredited Waitr Stockholder would otherwise be
entitled under this _Article III_ , Landcadia may, in its sole discretion,
elect to pay to such Non-Accredited Waitr Stockholder an amount in cash (the
" _Substitute Cash Amount_ ") equal to the product of (i) the Stock Portion
payable to such Non-Accredited Waitr Stockholder, as set forth on the Waitr
Closing Statement, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Reference Price.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Procedures Regarding Waitr Capital Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Procedures_. Prior to the Closing, Waitr shall mail or
otherwise deliver, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or
otherwise deliver, to each Waitr Stockholder entitled to receive the Stock
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ , a letter of transmittal to be
agreed upon by the Parties and the Exchange Agent prior to the Closing (the "
_Waitr Letter of Transmittal_ ") together with any notice required pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL or Part 13 of the LBCA. Subject to the satisfaction
of the conditions in _Article VII_, in the event that at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a Waitr Stockholder does not deliver
to the Exchange Agent a duly executed and completed Waitr Letter of
Transmittal, then such failure shall not alter, limit or delay the Closing;
_provided_ , that such Waitr Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive its
respective Stock Consideration until such Person delivers a duly executed and
completed Waitr Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent. Upon delivery of
such duly executed Waitr Letter of Transmittal by such Waitr Stockholder to
the Exchange Agent, such Waitr Stockholder shall be entitled to receive,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration in respect of his, her or its shares of Waitr Common Stock
referenced in such Waitr Letter of Transmittal. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.7_ , each share of Waitr Common Stock shall
be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which such Waitr
Stockholder is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



    

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _No Further Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Waitr Capital Stock in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to have been exchanged and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the securities represented by such
Waitr Capital Stock and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of Waitr Surviving Subsidiary of the shares of Waitr
Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Waitr Capital
Stock shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of Waitr, except
as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no evidence of book-entry shares representing
fractional shares of Landcadia Common Stock shall be issued in exchange for
Waitr Capital Stock or shares subject to Vested Options. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Landcadia shall pay to each former
Waitr Stockholder or and Vested Option Holders that otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the Reference Price
_multiplied by_ (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Landcadia Common Stock that
such Waitr Stockholder or and Vested Option Holders would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

(d) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions declared with
respect to Landcadia Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after
the Effective Time, shall be paid to any Waitr Stockholder that has not
delivered a properly completed, duly executed Waitr Letter of Transmittal.
After the delivery of a duly executed Waitr Letter of Transmittal, Waitr
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which had become payable with
respect to Landcadia Common Stock issuable to such Waitr Stockholder.

  



  

(e) _Waitr Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, any Waitr Dissenting Share shall not
be converted into the right to receive its applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any such Waitr
Dissenting Share pursuant to the LBCA. Each holder of Waitr Dissenting Shares
who, pursuant to the LBCA, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such
shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the LBCA (but only
after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to the LBCA). If, after the Effective Time, any Waitr Dissenting
Share shall lose its status as a Waitr Dissenting Share, then any such share
shall immediately be converted into the right to receive its applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration as if such share never had been a Waitr
Dissenting Share, and Landcadia shall deliver, or cause to be delivered in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to the holder thereof, following
the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in this
_Section 3.7_ , its applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as if such
share had never been a Waitr Dissenting Share. Waitr shall give Landcadia
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by Waitr, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the LBCA and
received by Waitr. Waitr shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Landcadia, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand with respect
to any Waitr Dissenting Share. Waitr shall enforce any contractual waivers
that any holders of its equity securities have granted regarding appraisal
rights that would apply to the Merger.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 3.8 _Treatment of Waitr Convertible Notes_. At least five
(5) days prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of each
Waitr Convertible Note, Waitr shall notify each Waitr Convertible Note Holder
of such holder's option to (a) to have all outstanding principal and accrued
interest under its respective Waitr Convertible Notes automatically converted
to shares of Waitr Series AA Preferred Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the Waitr Convertible Notes (such
Waitr Convertible Notes to be so converted, " _Waitr Converting Convertible
Notes_ ") or (b) receive an amount equal to 1.5 times the amount of principal
outstanding and accrued interest under such Waitr Convertible Notes as of the
Closing Date (such non-converting Waitr Convertible Notes, the " _Waitr
Cashing Out Convertible Notes_ " and such amount for each Waitr Cashing Out
Convertible Note, the " _Waitr Convertible Note Cash Out Amount_ "). At the
Effective Time, Landcadia shall pay to each holder of a Waitr Cashing Out
Convertible Note an amount in cash equal to the Waitr Convertible Note Cash
Amount and, upon receipt thereof, the applicable Waitr Cashing Out Convertible
Note shall be terminated without any further action by Waitr or the holder of
the Waitr Cashing Out Convertible Note.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Withholding Rights_. Waitr, Landcadia and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, any
amounts that are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such
consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or
non-U.S. tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 9.9 _CONSENT TO JURISDICTION_. EACH OF LANDCADIA, MERGER
SUB AND WAITR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE APPLICABLE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN THE STATE
OF DELAWARE, FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING

Section 9.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any Party does not perform
its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing
to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the
Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither Waitr nor Landcadia would have entered into this Agreement. Each
Party agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate
remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.

expressly named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Without limiting the
rights of Waitr under and to the extent provided under _Section 9.13_ ,
except to the extent a named Party to this Agreement (and then only to the
extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named Party in this
Agreement), (i) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named Party to this
Agreement and (ii) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of Waitr or Landcadia under
this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Publicity_. All press releases or other public
communications of any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of the release for publication
thereof, shall prior to the Closing be subject to the prior mutual approval of
Landcadia and Waitr, in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld by any Party.

  



  

Section 9.16 _Non-Survival_. None of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument,
document or certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
the Effective Time and shall expire upon the occurrence of the Effective
Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein
which by their terms expressly apply in whole or in part after the Effective
Time and then only to such extent.

  



  

Section 9.17 _Trust Account Waiver_. Waitr acknowledges and agrees
that Landcadia is a blank check company with the power and privileges to
effect a merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business
combination involving Waitr and one or more businesses or assets. Waitr
acknowledges and agrees that Landcadia's sole assets consist of the cash
proceeds of Landcadia's initial public offering and private placements of its
securities, and that substantially all of these proceeds have been deposited
in the Trust Account for the benefit of its public stockholders. For and in
consideration of Landcadia entering into this Agreement, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Waitr its Affiliates, managers,
directors, officers, affiliates, members, stockholders and trustees, do
hereby irrevocably waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they
have or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account, and
waives any claim it has or may have as a result of, or arising out of, the
Transaction or any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Landcadia, and
Waitr shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, seek recourse against
the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever.
