Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), all other income,
proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the

(e) Should Purchaser pay any Property Costs for which Seller is responsible

following the final determination and payment of the Adjusted Purchase Price
in accordance with Section 9.4(b).

(g) Consistent with Section 12.2 (as applicable), Taxes that are included in
Property Costs, right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs
that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in
the applicable period falling before and the number of days in the applicable
period falling at and after the Effective Time, except that production,
severance and similar Taxes (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, ad valorem
and similar property Taxes that are assessed based on the quantity of or the
value of production during preceding annual periods) measured by the quantity
of or the value of production shall be prorated based on the number of units
or value of production actually produced or sold, as applicable, before, and
at or after, the Effective Time. In each case, Purchaser shall be responsible
for the portion allocated to the period at and after the Effective Time and
Seller shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period before the
Effective Time.

Section 2.5 Procedures.

(a) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with
respect thereto) under Section 2.4, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to
be "from or attributable to" the Leases, the Units and the Wells when they
pass through the inlet flange of the pipeline connecting into the storage
facilities into which they are run or, if there are no such storage
facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or similar meters at the
initial point of entry into the pipelines through which they are transported
from the field and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Leases, the Units and the Wells when they pass through
the delivery point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are
transported. Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to
arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and
strapping data is not available. Seller shall provide to Purchaser evidence of
all meter readings and all gauging and strapping procedures conducted on or
about the Effective 

Time in connection with the Assets, together with all data necessary to
support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment
to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.3. The terms "earned"
and "incurred" shall be interpreted in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society ("COPAS")
standards, and expenditures that are incurred pursuant to an operating
agreement, unit agreement or similar agreement shall be deemed incurred when
expended by the operator of the applicable Lease, Unit or Well, in accordance
with Seller's current practice.

(b) After Closing, Purchaser shall handle all joint interest audits and other
audits of Property Costs covering the period for which Seller is in whole or
in part responsible under Section 2.4, provided that Purchaser shall not agree
to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Seller is liable, or
any compromise of any audit claims to which Seller would be entitled, without
the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any expenses from such audit shall be borne
by Purchaser and Seller, respectively, in the same proportion as the Property
Costs at issue are or would be borne by Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser shall
provide Seller with a copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit
agreements received by Purchaser or its Affiliates and relating to periods for
which Seller is wholly or partially responsible.

ARTICLE 3 
PURCHASE PRICE

Section 3.1 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Assets shall be six
hundred forty million two hundred eighty-five thousand one hundred seventy-
nine Dollars ($640,285,179)(the "Unadjusted Purchase Price"), as adjusted and
paid, as applicable, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.3, Section
9.3 and Section 9.4. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Purchaser has delivered or caused to be delivered to an account
(the "Escrow Account") with JPMorgan Chase (the "Escrow Agent"), a wire
transfer in the amount equal to (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the
"Deposit") to be held, invested, and disbursed in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and an escrow agreement of even date herewith among Seller,
Purchaser, and Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agreement"). The balance in the
Escrow Account shall be distributed to Seller in accordance with Section
9.3(a) if the Closing occurs or shall be otherwise distributed in accordance
with the terms of Section 10.3.

Section 3.2 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Parties recognize that this
transaction is a sale of the Assets to Purchaser subject to the requirements
of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and,
therefore, that an IRS Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement, will be
required to be filed by the Parties. The Parties agree that the Unadjusted
Purchase Price and any liabilities associated with the Assets (to the extent
properly taken into account as consideration under the Code) shall be
allocated among the Assets for Tax purposes as set forth on Schedule 3.2 (the
"Purchase Price Allocation Schedule"). Such allocation shall be determined in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and is intended by the Parties to be consistent with the Allocated
Values as determined pursuant to Section 3.4. Within twenty (20) days
following the final determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser
shall deliver to Seller for its review and reasonable comment, a revised
Purchase Price Allocation 

Schedule, adjusted to reflect the Adjusted Purchase Price. The Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule shall be revised to take into account subsequent
adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or the Adjusted Purchase Price
and any indemnification payments in the manner provided by applicable Law. If
the Parties are unable to agree on any revisions to the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule, any dispute arising in connection with the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule shall be resolved pursuant to procedures comparable to the
procedures applicable under Section 9.4(b). The Parties shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as
adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.2) in reporting this transaction to the
applicable Taxing authorities, including on IRS Form 8594 and any other
information or Tax Returns and supplements thereto required to be filed under
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Neither
Party shall, or shall permit their Affiliates to, file any Tax Return or
otherwise take any position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.2);
provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent either Party
from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing authority
based upon or arising out of the allocation (which may result in a change to
the allocation), and neither Party shall be required to litigate any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing authority challenging such allocation.

Section 3.3 Adjustments to Purchase Price. All adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be made (x) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in
accordance with GAAP as applied by Seller in its accounting of and for the
Assets (as of the Effective Time), (y) without duplication (in this Agreement
or otherwise) and (z) only with respect to matters (A) in the case of Section
3.3(a)(vi) and Section 3.3(b)(v), for which notice is given on or before the
Title Claim Date, and (B) in all of the other cases set forth in Section
3.3(a) and Section 3.3(b), identified on or before the 180th day after Closing
(the "Cut-off Date"). Each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
described in Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(b) shall be allocated among the
Assets in accordance with Section 3.4.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
adjusted as follows, with the resulting adjustments to such Unadjusted
Purchase Price herein the "Adjusted Purchase Price":

(h) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following
amounts (without duplication):

(i) an amount equal to all Property Costs and other costs attributable to the
ownership and operation of the Assets that are incurred at and after the
Effective Time but paid by Seller (as is consistent with Section 2.4(b) and
Section 2.4(c)), but excluding any amounts previously reimbursed to Seller
pursuant to Section 2.4(e);

(ii) an amount equal to, to the extent that such amounts have been received by
Purchaser and not remitted or paid to Seller, (A) all proceeds from the
production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Leases, the Units and
the Wells prior to the Effective Time, (B) all other income, proceeds,
receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective
Time and (C) any other amounts to which Seller is entitled pursuant to Section 

(iii) the amount of all prepaid expenses (including pre-paid bonuses, rentals,
location building expenses, cash calls and advances to Third Party operators
for expenses not yet incurred; prepaid production Taxes, severance Taxes and
other similar Taxes; and scheduled payments) paid by Seller with respect to
the ownership or operation of the Assets at or after the Effective Time;

(iv) to the extent that proceeds for such volumes have not been received by
Seller, an amount equal to the aggregated volumes of Hydrocarbons stored in
stock tanks, pipelines or other storage as of the Effective Time that are
attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets multiplied by the
contract price therefor on the Effective Time;

(v) to the extent that Seller is underproduced or overdelivered as of the
Effective Time as shown with respect to the any net Imbalances for any product
set forth in Schedule 5.15, as complete and final settlement of all such
Imbalances for each such product, the value of such Imbalances (calculated on
the basis of the average price of production of the applicable product for the
30 day period prior to the delivery of the preliminary settlement statement
referred to in Section 9.4(a));

(vi) any undisputed amounts for Title Benefits determined pursuant to Section
4.3;

(vii) an amount equal to the Seller Overhead Services Amount; and

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by the Parties as an upward adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(i) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following
amounts (without duplication):

(i) an amount equal to all Property Costs and other costs attributable to the
ownership and operation of the Assets that are incurred prior to the Effective
Time but paid by Purchaser (as is consistent with Section 2.4(b) and Section
2.4(c)), but excluding any amounts previously reimbursed to Purchaser pursuant
to Section 2.4(e);

(ii) an amount equal to, to the extent that such amounts have been received by
Seller and not remitted or paid to Purchaser, (A) all proceeds from the
production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Leases, the Units and
the Wells at and after the Effective Time, (B) all other income, proceeds,
receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets at and after the
Effective Time (excluding, all overhead fees and similar payments received
from Third Parties with respect to any Assets operated by Seller prior to the
Closing) and (C) any other amounts to which Purchaser is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(b);

(iii) to the extent that Seller is overproduced or underdelivered as of the
Effective Time as shown with respect to the any net Imbalances for any product
set forth in Schedule 5.15, as complete and final settlement of all such
Imbalances for each such product, 

the value of such Imbalances (calculated on the basis of the average price of
production of the applicable product for the 30 day period prior to the
delivery of the preliminary settlement statement referred to in Section
9.4(a));

(iv) to the extent not transferred to Purchaser at the Closing, all funds held
in suspense by Seller with respect to the operation, ownership, production and
developments, including those amounts set forth on Schedule 5.20;

(v) any undisputed amounts for Title Defects determined pursuant to Section
4.2 (which shall include, for purposes of certainty, an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of any Assets excluded from this transaction pursuant to
Section 4.2(c)) and any amounts excluded pursuant to Section 4.2(e);

(vi) an amount equal to the Allocated Value of any Assets excluded from this
transaction pursuant to Section 4.6;

(vii) an amount equal to the Allocated Value of any Assets excluded from this
transaction pursuant to Section 4.7(a); and

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by the Parties as a downward adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

Section 3.4 Allocated Values. The "Allocated Values" for the Assets (which are
provided for, and allocated amongst, each of the Units) are set forth on
Schedule 3.4. The share of each adjustment allocated to a particular Asset
shall be allocated to the particular Asset to which such adjustment relates to
the extent such adjustment relates to such Asset and to the extent that it is,
in the commercially reasonable discretion of Seller, possible to do so. Any
adjustment not allocated to a specific Asset pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence shall be allocated among the various Assets on a pro-rata
basis in proportion to the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset
on Schedule 3.4. Seller has accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but makes no
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

ARTICLE 4 
TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 4.1 Seller's Title. Except for the special warranty of title set forth
in the Assignments, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Seller's title to any of the
Assets, and Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to Section
4.5, Purchaser's sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title
Defect, with respect to any of the Assets, (a) on or before the applicable
Title Claim Date, shall be as set forth in Section 4.2 and, (b) subject to the
following sentence, from and after the applicable Title Claim Date (without
duplication), shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth in
the Assignments. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser
shall not be entitled 

to protection under (or the right to make a claim against) the special
warranty of title provided in the Assignments for any Title Defect reported
under this Article 4.

Section 4.2 Title Defects.

(j) To assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver a claim notice
to Seller (a "Title Defect Notice") promptly after the discovery thereof, but
in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Execution Date (such cut-off
date, the "Title Claim Date"). To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall
be in writing and include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect that
is reasonably sufficient for Seller to determine the basis of the alleged
Title Defect, (ii) if the Title Defect is an Environmental Defect, the
Asset(s) adversely affected by such Title Defect and if the Title Defect is
anything other than an Environmental Defect, the Unit adversely affected by
such Title Defect (in each case, a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) all documents upon which
Purchaser relies for its assertion of a Title Defect, including, at a minimum,
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title
attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Defect and (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title
Defect and the computations and information upon which Purchaser's belief is
based, including any analysis by any title attorney or examiner hired by
Purchaser (or, in the case of an Environmental Defect, any environmental
remediation analysis prepared by or for Purchaser).

(k) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure or remove on or before 120 days after the Title Claim Date
(the "Cure Period") any Title Defects (other than Environmental Defects for
which this Section 4.2(b) shall not apply) for which Seller has received a
Title Defect Notice from Purchaser prior to the Title Claim Date, and
Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably requested by Seller to assist it
with the cure or removal of any such Title Defects. No reduction shall be made
to the Closing Payment with respect to any Title Defect for which Seller has
provided notice to Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date that Seller
intends to attempt to cure the Title Defect during the Cure Period (a "Remedy
Notice") or for which Seller disputes the existence (a "Disputed Defect"). If
any Title Defect with respect to which Seller provided a Remedy Notice to
Purchaser is not cured by Seller within the Cure Period, Seller shall make an
election with respect to such Title Defect pursuant to Section 4.2(c) no later
than 130 days after the Title Claim Date (the "Remedy Deadline"); provided,
however, that any downward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price made
pursuant to Section 4.2(c) shall occur at the times set forth in Section 9.4;
and provided, further, that if, prior to the Remedy Deadline, the Parties
cannot agree on (i) the proper and adequate cure for any such Title Defect,
(ii) the Title Defect Amount or (iii) whether the alleged Title Defect
constitutes a Title Defect, such dispute(s) shall be finally and exclusively
resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4. An election by
Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its
rights under Section 4.4 and shall not constitute an admission against
interest or a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature or
value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title Defect. Any Disputed Defects that
have not been cured, waived or otherwise resolved by the Parties prior to the
Remedy Deadline shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with
the provisions of Section 4.4. 

(l) Subject to Section 4.2(e) regarding certain Environmental Defects, in the
event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or, subject to Section
4.2(b), not cured prior to the expiration of the Cure Period or Environmental
Cure Period, as applicable, Seller shall, subject to the Individual Defect
Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, elect to:

(i) make a downward adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price equal to an
amount determined (the "Title Defect Amount") pursuant to Section 4.2(d) as
being the value of such Title Defect; or

(ii) (A) subject to the consent of Purchaser, in the case of a Title Defect
that is not an Environmental Defect, exclude or have Purchaser reconvey, as
applicable, the Title Defect Property that is adversely affected by such Title
Defect;

(B) subject to the consent of Purchaser, in the case of an Environmental
Defect for which the asserted Title Defect Amount is less than the Allocated
Value of the Title Defect Property, exclude the applicable Title Defect
Property from the Assets; or

(C) in the case of a Title Defect that is an Environmental Defect for which
the asserted Title Defect Amount is equal to or greater than the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property, in Seller's sole discretion, exclude the
Title Defect Property from the Assets;

in any of which events the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward, by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property and such Title Defect Property shall no longer be included within the
definition of Assets for any purpose under this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2(c), no reduction
shall be made in the Unadjusted Purchase Price with respect to any Title
Defect for which the Parties agree to execute and deliver to one another a
written indemnity agreement, under which Seller agrees to fully,
unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from any
and all Damages arising out of or resulting from such Title Defect. Upon the
election of the remedy of a Title Defect pursuant to this Section 4.2(c), the
Parties shall complete any further reconveyancing (or conveyancing in the case
of an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property) of the relevant Title Defect
Property as is necessary to effect such remedy. In the case of any such
reconveyancing, Purchaser shall assign the relevant Title Defect Property to
Seller with a special warranty of title, subject to the Permitted
Encumbrances, by, through and under Purchaser. Any post-Closing conveyance of
an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property shall be effected by the execution
of an Assignment in the form set forth on Exhibit B, and such Environmental
Defect Hold-Back Property shall, from and after the date of such conveyance,
be deemed to be an Asset for all purposes of this Agreement. Any downward
adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 4.2
shall be made (and accounted for) at the times set forth in Section 9.4.

(m) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property adversely affected
by such Title Defect 

is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be
determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge that is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from Seller\'s interest
in the affected Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy (with a proportional decrease
in the working interest for the affected Title Defect Property) between (A)
the Net Revenue Interest for the affected Title Defect Property and (B) the
Net Revenue Interest stated in Schedule 3.4 then the Title Defect Amount shall
be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Revenue
Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
stated in Schedule 3.4;

(iv) if the Title Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Title Defect Amount
shall be the amount of the estimated costs and expenses to correct or
remediate the Environmental Defect (as of the Closing Date) in such a manner
that is consistent with applicable Environmental Laws;

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and
Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;
provided, however, that, the foregoing considerations notwithstanding, in the
event that the Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the
Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense
of curing or remediating, as applicable, such Title Defect;

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives
credit in the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price; and

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects (other than Environmental Defects) upon any Title Defect Property
shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property. 

(n) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.2:

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

with respect to alleged Environmental Defects (for which the asserted Title
Defect Amount is in excess of the Individual Defect Threshold) for which
Purchaser and Seller have not, prior to the Closing, agreed to a Title Defect
Amount (in accordance with Section 4.2(d)(iv)) or for which, prior to Closing,
the Title Defect Amount has not been determined pursuant to Section 4.4; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

in the event the Parties have not, prior to Closing, agreed that an alleged
Environmental Defect constitutes a Title Defect; 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

with respect to alleged Environmental Defects for which the asserted Title
Defect Amount is less than the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property
and the Parties have made an election to exclude pursuant to Section 4.2(c); 

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

with respect to an alleged Environmental Defect for which the asserted Title
Defect Amount is equal to or greater than the Allocated Value of the Title
Defect Property and Seller has made an election to exclude pursuant to Section
4.2(c); or 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

|

with respect to any alleged Environmental Defect for which Seller has provided
notice to Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date that Seller intends to
cure or remove the Environmental Defect on or before 180 days after the Title
Claim Date (the "Environmental Cure Period"), 

the affected Title Defect Property that is subject to such alleged
Environmental Defect (an "Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property") shall (X)
not be included in the Assets at Closing, and (Y) the Unadjusted Purchase
Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property (and, if not already reflected in
the preliminary settlement statement prepared prior to Closing pursuant to
Section 9.4(a), the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Hold-Back
Property shall be excluded from the Closing Payment payable at Closing).

(i) During the Environmental Cure Period, Seller shall have the right, but not
the obligation, at its sole cost, to cure or remove the Environmental Defect
affecting any Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property, in which case Seller
shall release and indemnify Purchaser Group in accordance with Section 7.1,
applied mutatis mutandis if Seller or Seller's Representatives access
Purchaser's property in its attempt to cure or remove the Environmental Defect
affecting an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property. Any Environmental Defect
Hold-Back Property for which the Environmental Defect is cured or removed
during the Environmental Cure Period shall promptly thereafter be conveyed
from Seller to Purchaser, provided that if the Parties cannot agree on the
proper and adequate cure for an Environmental Defect or that an Environmental
Defect has been cure or removed, 

such dispute shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.4.

(ii) If an Environmental Defect affecting any Environmental Defect Hold-Back
Property is not cured or removed by Seller within the Environmental Cure
Period, then the Parties or Seller, as applicable, shall determine the remedy
with respect to such Environmental Defect pursuant to Section 4.2(c) no later
than 10 days after the end of the Environmental Cure Period;

(iii) If any conveyance of an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property is
completed prior to the Final Settlement Statement Date, then the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such conveyed Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property and further
adjusted as applicable for the adjustments set forth in Section 3.3 that
relate to such Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property. If any conveyance of
an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property is completed after the Final
Settlement Statement Date, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such conveyed Environmental Defect Hold-Back
Property, adjusted as applicable for the adjustments set forth in Section 3.3
that relate to such Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property.

(f) It is understood and agreed that Environmental Defects shall constitute
Title Defects for purposes of this Agreement (as is provided in the definition
of "Title Defects" set forth in Appendix A) and, as such, will be handled in
accordance with, and in all instances will be subject to, the provisions of
this Section 4.2 (other than Section 4.2(b) and Section 4.2(d)(vii) which
shall not apply to Environmental Defects) and the other applicable provisions
of this Article 4 (including the thresholds and deductibles set forth in
Section 4.5). For the avoidance of doubt, the Aggregate Defect Deductible is a
single amount which includes both Title Defects and Environmental Defects.
Without limiting the disclaimers and acknowledgements set forth in Article 5
and Article 6, respectively, PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY REMEDIES
OR CLAIMS (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY) THAT IT MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER, ITS
AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS WITH
RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS, EXCEPT SOLELY FOR THOSE REMEDIES SET FORTH
IN THIS ARTICLE 4 AND SECTION 11.2(B)(IV).

Section 4.3 Title Benefits.

(c) Seller has the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser on
or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered
by Seller a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") in writing and including (i) a
description of the Title Benefit reasonably sufficient to determine the basis
of the alleged Title Benefit, (ii) the Unit affected by such Title Benefit (a
"Title Benefit Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit
Property, (iv) all documents upon which Seller relies for its assertion of a
Title Benefit, including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Purchaser (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by
Purchaser) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit and (v) the
amount by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Benefit Property is increased by such Title Benefit and 

the computations and information upon which Seller's belief is based on or
before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by
Seller.

(d) Subject to the Individual Benefit Threshold and the Aggregate Benefit
Deductible, with respect to each Title Benefit Property affected by Title
Benefits reported under Section 4.3(a), the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in
the Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property, as determined pursuant to
Section 4.3(c). Any upward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be made (and accounted for) at the times
set forth in Section 9.4.

(e) The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be the
amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property affected by
such Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title
Benefit and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit reflects a difference (with a proportional increase
in the working interest for the affected Title Defect Property) between (A)
the Net Revenue Interest for the affected Title Benefit Property and (B) the
Net Revenue Interest stated in Schedule 3.4, then the Title Benefit Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net
Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest stated in Schedule 3.4; and

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a benefit in the ownership or title to
the Title Benefit Property of a type not described in subsections (i) or (ii)
above, the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the Title
Benefit Property benefitted by the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the
Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the
life of the Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit
by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation.

(f) If the Parties cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title Benefits and
Title Benefit Amounts by the scheduled Closing, the provisions of Section 4.4
shall apply.

Section 4.4 Title Disputes. The Parties shall attempt to agree on all Title
Defects and Title Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts,
respectively, prior to Closing. If the Parties are unable to agree on Title
Defects and Title Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts,
respectively, by the scheduled Closing, then Seller's good faith estimate
shall be used to determine the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 9.4. If,
after the Remedy Deadline, the Parties are unable to agree on an alleged Title
Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount (the
"Disputed Title Matters") such dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall be
exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following provisions
of this Section 4.4. Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than the
tenth (10th) Business Day 

following the Remedy Deadline a written description meeting the requirements
of Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.3(a), as applicable, together with all
supporting documentation, of the Disputed Title Matters. By not later than ten
(10) Business Days after Seller's receipt of Purchaser's written description
of the Disputed Title Matters, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a written
response setting forth Seller's position with respect to the Disputed Title
Matters together with all supporting documentation.

(a) By not later than ten (10) Business Days after Purchaser's receipt of
Seller's written response to Purchaser's written description of the Disputed
Title Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any
such dispute(s) conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent that such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section, by written notice (the "Title
Arbitration Notice") to Seller of any Disputed Title Matters not otherwise
resolved or waived that are to be resolved by arbitration ("Final Disputed
Title Matters").

(b) The arbitration shall be held before a one member arbitration panel (the
"Title Arbitrator"), determined as follows. The Title Arbitrator shall be an
attorney with at least ten (10) years' experience (i) in the case of Title
Defects other than Environmental Defects, examining oil and gas titles in the
State of North Dakota and (ii) in the case of Environmental Defects, as an
environmental attorney practicing in the State of North Dakota. Within two (2)
Business Days following Seller's receipt of the Title Arbitration Notice,
Seller and Purchaser shall each exchange lists of three (3) acceptable,
qualified arbitrators. Within two (2) Business Days following the exchange of
lists of acceptable arbitrators, the Parties shall select by mutual agreement
the Title Arbitrator from their original lists of three (3) acceptable
arbitrators. If no such agreement is reached within seven (7) Business Days
following the delivery of Title Arbitration Notice, the Houston, Texas office
of the American Arbitration Association shall select an arbitrator from the
original lists provided by the Parties to serve as the Title Arbitrator.

(c) Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the Title
Arbitrator, the Parties shall submit one copy to the Title Arbitrator of (i)
this Agreement, with specific reference to this Section 4.4 and the other
applicable provisions of this Article 4, (ii) Purchaser's written description
of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents
that were provided to Seller, (iii) Seller's written response to Purchaser's
written description of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the
supporting documents that were provided to Purchaser and (iv) the Title
Arbitration Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall resolve the Final Disputed
Title Matters based only on the foregoing submissions, and shall select either
the position of Seller or Purchaser with respect to each Final Disputed Title
Matter. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right to submit additional
documentation to the Title Arbitrator nor to demand discovery on the other
Party.

(d) The Title Arbitrator shall make its determination by written decision
within thirty (30) days following Seller's receipt of the Title Arbitration
Notice (the "Arbitration Decision"). The Arbitration Decision shall be final
and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making its
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of this
Article 4. The Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested
Third Parties to advise the Title Arbitrator, 

but shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants and shall
only use such Third Parties to the extent necessary to resolve the Final
Disputed Title Matters. Any such consultant shall not have worked as an
employee or consultant for either Party or its Affiliates during the five (5)
year period preceding the arbitration nor have any financial interest in the
dispute.

(e) The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts or
Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts and shall not be empowered to award
damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.

(f) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of preparing
and presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, including any
costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are attributable to the
consultation of any Third Party.

(g) The Parties shall implement the Arbitration Decision as follows: (i) in
the case of alleged Title Defects determined to be Title Defects, such Title
Defects shall be remedied pursuant to Section 4.2(c) within ten (10) Business
Days following Seller's receipt of the Arbitration Decision (with any amounts
owed, as a result of such remedy, to be made and accounted for at the times
set forth in Section 9.4(b)), and (ii) in the case of disputed Title Benefits,
Title Benefit Amounts or Title Defect Amounts, any amounts determined to be
owed by either Party shall be accounted for in the determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 9.4(b). Any alleged Title Defects
or Title Benefits determined not to be Title Defects or Title Benefits under
the Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding as not being Title Defects
or Title Benefits. The Parties shall complete any reconveyancing of property
as is necessary to effect the remedy determined pursuant to subsection (i)
above. In the case of any such reconveyancing, Purchaser shall assign the
relevant Lease or Well to Seller with a special warranty of title, subject to
no burdens, liens or encumbrances other than the Permitted Encumbrances, by,
through and under Purchaser.

(h) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 4.4
shall be decided by the Title Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of the
State of Texas.

Section 4.5 Limitations on Applicability.

(a) The right of Purchaser or Seller to assert a Title Defect or Title
Benefit, respectively, under this Article 4 shall terminate on the Title Claim
Date, except that until the alleged Title Defect or Title Benefit or Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, is resolved in
accordance with this Agreement, there shall be no termination of Purchaser's
or Seller's rights under this Article 4 with respect to any alleged Title
Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount
properly reported in accordance with Section 4.4 on or before the Title Claim
Date. Thereafter, Purchaser's and Seller's sole and exclusive rights and
remedies with regard to title to the Assets shall be as set forth in the
respective Assignments. Without limiting the foregoing, if a Title Defect
under this Article 4 results from any matter that could also result in the
breach of any representation or warranty of Seller as set forth in Article 5
or a breach of Seller's special warranty of title in the Assignments, and
Purchaser has knowledge of such matter prior to the Title Claim Date,
Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert such matter as a Title Defect to 

extent permitted by Article 4; and, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
shall be precluded from also asserting any such matter as the basis of the
breach of any such representation or warranty or as a claim against Seller's
special warranty of title provided in the Assignments.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other
remedies available in respect of Title Defects (including Title Defects
constituting Environmental Defects) or Title Benefits, as applicable, under
this Article 4:

(i) With respect to Title Defects, (A) for any Title Defect Amount with
respect to an individual Title Defect Property if such amount does not exceed
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the "Individual Defect Threshold"),
provided that, Purchaser shall be entitled to recover the full Title Defect
Amount once the Individual Defect Threshold is met, subject to the Aggregate
Defect Deductible; and (B) unless the amount of all such Title Defect Amounts
(provided that each such Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Defect
Threshold), in the aggregate (excluding any Title Defect Amounts with respect
to Title Defects cured or indemnified by Seller in accordance with this
Article 4) exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price (the "Aggregate Defect Deductible"), after which point, subject to the
Individual Defect Threshold, Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price or other remedies elected by Seller in accordance
with Section 4.2(c) only with respect to Title Defect Amounts in excess of
such Aggregate Defect Deductible and only to the extent that Title Defect
Amounts exceed the Aggregate Defect Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Title Defects which would otherwise constitute breaches of the special
warranty of title set forth in the Assignments but which are asserted prior to
the Title Claim Date shall not be subject to the Individual Defect Threshold
or the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

(ii) With respect to Title Benefits, (A) for any Title Benefit Amount with
respect to an individual Title Benefit Property: if such amount does not
exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the "Individual Benefit
Threshold"), provided that, Seller shall be entitled to recover the full Title
Benefit Amount once the Individual Benefit Threshold is met, subject to the
Aggregate Benefit Deductible; and (B) unless the amount of all such Title
Benefit Amounts (provided that each such Title Benefit Amount exceeds the
Individual Benefit Threshold), in the aggregate exceeds two and one-half
percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the "Aggregate Benefit
Deductible"), after which point, subject to the Individual Benefit Threshold,
Seller shall be entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price only
with respect to Title Benefit Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Benefit
Deductible and only to the extent that Title Benefit Amounts exceed the
Aggregate Benefit Deductible.

(c) Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the
exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties' rights or obligations in
respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set forth more fully
in Section 13.14, time is of the essence in performing their obligations and
exercising their rights under this Article 4, and, as such, that each and 

date and time by which such performance or exercise is due shall be the firm
and final date and time.

Section 4.6 Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase.

(a) Promptly after the Execution Date, Seller shall prepare and send (i)
notices to the holders of any required consents to assignment (including the
Specified Consent Requirements that are set forth on Schedule 5.16) requesting
consents to the Assignments; (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable
preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (including rights to
purchase or similar rights arising in connection with change in control
provisions) (collectively, "Preferential Rights") that are set forth on
Schedule 5.16 in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting
waivers of such rights; and (iii) upon Purchaser's review and written request,
notices under each Contract and for each interest described under Section
2.2(g) or Section 2.2(i) for which consent or a waiver is required from a
counterparty or under applicable Law in order to transfer, assign or amend
such Contract. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause such
consents and waivers of Preferential Rights (or the exercise thereof), to be
obtained and delivered prior to Closing. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller
in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of Preferential
Rights. Any Preferential Right must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 9 as to those Assets for which Preferential
Rights have not been exercised. The consideration payable under this Agreement
for any particular Asset for purposes of Preferential Right notices shall be
the Allocated Value for such Asset, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
3.3. If, prior to the Closing Date, any Party discovers any required consents
or Preferential Rights (applying to the Assets) for which notices have not
been delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4.6(a), then (A)
the Party making such discovery shall provide the other Party with written
notification of such consents or Preferential Rights, as applicable, (B)
Seller, following delivery or receipt of such written notification, will
promptly send notices to the holders of such required consents requesting
consents and notices to the holders of such Preferential Rights in compliance
with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights and (C)
the terms and conditions of this Section 4.6 shall apply to the Assets subject
to such consents or Preferential Rights, as applicable.

(b) In no event shall there be included in the Assignments any Asset for which
a Specified Consent Requirement has not been satisfied. In cases in which the
Asset subject to such a requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned
the Property or Properties to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is
not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived Specified Consent
Requirement, (i) Seller shall continue after Closing to use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to satisfy the Specified Consent Requirement so that such
Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the Specified Consent
Requirement, (ii) the Contract shall be held by Seller for the benefit of
Purchaser until the Specified Consent Requirement is satisfied or the Contract
has terminated and (iii) Purchaser shall pay all amounts due thereunder,
perform all obligations thereunder and indemnify Seller against any Damages
incurred or suffered by Seller as a consequence of remaining a party to such
Contract until the Specified Consent Requirement is satisfied or the Contract
has terminated. In cases in which the Asset subject to such a Specified
Consent Requirement is a Property and such consent is not satisfied by
Closing, the affected Property 

and the Assets related to that Property shall not be transferred at Closing
and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
the Property and related Assets, provided that Seller shall continue after
Closing to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to satisfy the Specified
Consent Requirement so that such Property and the Assets related to the
Property can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the Specified Consent
Requirement, subject to the remainder of this Section 4.6(b). If an
unsatisfied Specified Consent Requirement with respect to which an adjustment
to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section 3.3 is subsequently
satisfied prior to the date of delivery of the final settlement statement
under Section 9.4(b), a separate closing shall be held within five (5)
Business Days thereof at which (i) Seller shall convey the affected Property
and related Assets to Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and (ii)
Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Property
and related Assets, adjusted in accordance with Section 3.3, to Seller. If
such consent requirement is not satisfied by the date of delivery of the final
settlement statement, Seller shall have no further obligation to sell and
convey such Property and related Assets and Purchaser shall have no further
obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such Property, and the affected
Property and related Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A‑1,
Exhibit A‑2, Schedule 3.4 and the other applicable Exhibits and Schedules to
this Agreement for all purposes.

(c) If any Preferential Right affecting an Asset is exercised prior to
Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated
Value for such Assets, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted
from Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Schedule 3.4 and the other applicable Exhibits
and Schedules to this Agreement for all purposes. Seller shall retain the
consideration paid by the Third Party, and shall have no further obligation
with respect to such affected Assets under this Agreement. Should a Third
Party fail to exercise its Preferential Right as to any portion of the Assets
prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired, the
affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing and the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values of such Assets. In the
event that such Third Party exercises its Preferential Right following the
Closing, Seller shall have no further obligation to sell and convey the
affected Assets and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase,
accept and pay for such affected Assets, and the affected Assets shall be
deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Schedule 3.4 and the other
applicable Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement for all purposes. If, on
the other hand, the applicable Preferential Rights are waived or expire, a
separate closing shall be held within five (5) Business Days thereof at which
(i) Seller shall convey the affected Assets to Purchaser in accordance with
this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Assets, adjusted in accordance with Section 3.3, to Seller.

Section 4.7 Casualty or Condemnation Loss.

(a) If, after the Execution Date, but prior to the Closing Date, any portion
of the Assets is damaged, destroyed or made unavailable or unusable for the
intended purpose by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or
under right of eminent domain (each a "Casualty Loss"), and the loss as a
result of such individual Casualty Loss exceeds five percent (5%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close,
and Seller shall elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either
(i) to cause the Assets adversely affected by any such individual Casualty
Loss to be repaired or restored to at least their condition prior to such 

Casualty Loss, at Seller's sole cost and expense, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), (ii) to indemnify
Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to
repair or restore the Assets subject to any such Casualty Loss or (iii) to
exclude the affected Assets from this Agreement and reduce the Unadjusted
Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Assets. In each case, Seller
shall retain all rights to insurance, unpaid awards, condemnation payments and
other rights and claims against Third Parties with respect to the Casualty
Loss, except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

(b) If, after the Execution Date, but prior to the Closing Date, any Casualty
Loss occurs, and the loss as a result of such individual Casualty Loss is five
percent (5%) or less of the Unadjusted Purchased Price, Purchaser shall
nevertheless be required to close and Seller shall, at Closing, pay to
Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties (including insurers) by
reason of such individual Casualty Loss and, to the extent necessary, shall
assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to all of
Seller's right, title and interest (if any) in unpaid awards, condemnation
payments and other rights and claims against Third Parties (other than Persons
within the Seller Group) arising out of the Casualty Loss.

Seller's possession, for the purpose of conducting a reasonable due diligence
review of the Assets, but only to the extent that Seller may do so without

done by Purchaser shall result from Purchaser's own independent review and
judgment.

Seller's normal business hours, and Purchaser's investigation shall be
conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the operation of the

PARTY OPERATOR'S RULES, REGULATIONS, OR OPERATING POLICIES, ARISING OUT OF,

(a) Neither Party shall make any press release or other public announcement
regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other Party (collectively, the "Public Announcement Restrictions").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Public Announcement Restrictions shall not
restrict disclosures to the extent (i) necessary for a Party to perform this
Agreement (including disclosures to Governmental Bodies or Third Parties
holding Preferential Rights, rights of consent or other rights that may be
applicable to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, as reasonably
necessary to provide notices, seek waivers, amendments or termination of such
rights, or seek such consents); (ii) required (upon advice of counsel) by
applicable securities or other Laws 

or regulations or the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Parties'
or their respective Affiliates' stock is listed, and in such event, the

press release, a detailed power point presentation and a conference call, and,
to the extent required by Law, filing this Agreement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as an exhibit to an 8-K or 10-Q; or (iii) that such Party
has given the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure
prior to its release and no objection is raised. In the case of the
disclosures described under subsections (i) and (ii) of this Section 7.3(a),
each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party
regarding the contents of any such release or announcement prior to making
such release or announcement, it being understood that no Party may deny the
other from making such disclosure.

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, the Parties shall keep all
information and data relating to this Agreement and the Assets strictly
confidential except for disclosures to Representatives of the Parties (in
which event, the disclosing Party will be responsible for making sure that the
Representatives keep such information and data confidential) and any
disclosures required to perform this Agreement (collectively, the
"Confidentiality Restrictions"). However, prior to making any disclosures
permitted under the preceding sentence, the Party disclosing such information
shall obtain an undertaking of confidentiality from the Person receiving such
information. The Confidentiality Restrictions shall not restrict disclosures
that are required (upon advice of counsel) by applicable securities or other
Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the Parties or their respective Affiliates. Following
Closing, Purchaser shall not be bound by Confidentiality Restrictions relating
to information concerning the Assets and Seller shall be bound by
Confidentiality Restrictions relating to information concerning the Assets for
a period of twelve (12) months, except to the extent such information
concerning the Assets (i) is or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller or (ii) was provided to
Seller by, or becomes available to Seller from, a Third Party, provided that
such Third Party was not known by Seller, after reasonable investigation, to
be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to Purchaser.

(c) To the extent that the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3 conflict
with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of this
Section 7.3 shall control to the extent of such conflict. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate automatically at Closing without further action by
either Party.

operating agreement with respect to any operation; provided, if Seller desires
to elect to be treated as a non-consenting party under either case in the
foregoing clause of this Section 7.4(i), and Purchaser denies approval of such
election by Seller, Seller shall participate in the operation and, if this
Agreement terminates prior to Closing, Purchaser shall bear the costs
associated with such operation (and shall indemnify Seller from and against
such costs) and shall be entitled to the benefits attributable to such
operation until the applicable non-consent recoupment has been satisfied in

Purchaser's approval of any action restricted by this Section 7.4 shall be
considered granted within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time, not to be less
than 48 hours, is reasonably required by the circumstances and the applicable
operating agreement and such shorter time is specified in Seller's notice)
after Purchaser's receipt of Seller's written notice requesting such consent,
unless Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary during that period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an emergency, Seller may take
such action as a prudent operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of
such action promptly thereafter.

Section 7.5 Non-Solicitation of Employees. From the Execution Date through the
Closing, Purchaser will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or employ any officer or employee of Seller
or its Affiliates with whom Purchaser or its Affiliates have had direct
contact as part of its evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein without obtaining the prior written consent
of Seller (except as may otherwise be set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement). This Section 7.5 shall not include general solicitations of
employment not specifically directed towards officers or employees of Seller
or its Affiliates.

Section 7.6 Change of Name. Within ninety (90) days after Closing, Purchaser
shall eliminate or obscure the name "Helis Oil and Company, L.L.C." and any
variants thereof from the Assets and shall have no right to use any logos,
trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

Section 7.7 Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guaranties. The
Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and guaranties,
if any, posted by Seller or its Affiliates with Governmental Bodies or co-
owners and relating to the Assets will be transferred to Purchaser. On or
prior to Closing, Purchaser shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name 

Purchaser, replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and guaranties, to
the extent such replacements are necessary to permit the cancellation of the
bonds, letters of credit and guaranties posted by Seller or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.8 Notification of Breaches. Between the Execution Date and the
Closing Date:

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been
so performed or observed in any material respect.

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after Seller obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has not
been so performed or observed in any material respect.

(c) If any of Purchaser's or Seller's representations or warranties is untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect between the Execution Date and
the Closing Date, or if any of Purchaser's or Seller's covenants or agreements
to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing Date shall not have
been so performed or observed in any material respect, but if such breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if curable) be cured by
the Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, by the date set forth in
Section 9.1), then such breach shall be considered not to have occurred for
all purposes of this Agreement.

Section 7.9 Amendment to Schedules.

(d) As of the Closing Date, all Schedules to this Agreement, as applicable,
shall be deemed amended and supplemented by Seller to include reference to any
matter which results in an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant
to Section 3.3 as a result of the removal under the terms of this Agreement of
any of the Assets.

(e) Prior to Closing, Seller shall have the right to supplement its Schedules
relating to the representations and warranties set forth in Article 5 with
respect to any matters discovered or occurring subsequent to the Execution
Date which, if existing or known at the date hereof or thereafter, would have
been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules, including
amendments to reflect actions taken in compliance with Section 7.4 ("Section
7.4 Updates"). For all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in Article 8 have been fulfilled,
the Schedules to Seller's representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein
on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained
in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto; provided, however, that (a)
if Closing shall occur, then only those matters disclosed pursuant to any such
addition, supplement or amendment at or prior to Closing which arose and/or
occurred, as applicable, from and after the Execution Date up to Closing and
which were not caused by Seller shall be waived and Purchaser shall not be
entitled to 

make a claim with respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
otherwise and (b) Section 7.4 Updates shall be deemed to have been made on the
Execution Date and shall be included for all purposes of this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, if any matter disclosed pursuant to any such addition,
supplement or amendment at or prior to Closing did not arise and/or occur, as
applicable, from and after the Execution Date up to Closing or relates to a
matter caused by Seller (other than Section 7.4 Updates), regardless of when
Seller obtained knowledge of such matter, such addition, supplement or
amendment shall not be waived and Purchaser shall be entitled to make a claim
with respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Section 7.10 Regulatory Matters. From and after the date of this Agreement
until December 31, 2017 (the "Records Period"), Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
agents and representatives to, provide reasonable cooperation to Purchaser,
its Affiliates and their agents and representatives in connection with
Purchaser's or its Affiliates' filings, if any, that are required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, under securities laws applicable to
Purchaser and its Affiliates (collectively, the "Filings"). During the Records
Period, Seller agrees to make available to Purchaser and its Affiliates and
their agents and representatives any and all books, records, information and
documents that are attributable to the Assets in Seller's or its Affiliates'
possession or control and access to Seller's and its Affiliates' personnel, in
each case as reasonably required by Purchaser, its Affiliates and their agents
and representatives in order to prepare, if required, in connection with the
Filings, financial statements meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), along with any documentation
attributable to the Assets required to complete any audit associated with such
financial statements. During the Records Period, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, provide reasonable cooperation to the independent auditors
chosen by Purchaser ("Purchaser's Auditor") in connection with any audit by
Purchaser's Auditor of any financial statements of Seller or its Affiliates
with respect to the Assets that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates requires to
comply with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 with respect to any Filings. During the Records Period, Seller and
its Affiliates shall retain all books, records, information and documents
relating to the Assets for the three (3) fiscal years prior to January 1, 2012
and the period from January 1, 2012 through the Closing Date. Purchaser will
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates, within ten (10) business days after
demand in writing therefor, for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Seller and its Affiliates in complying with the provision of this Section
7.10.

Section 7.11 Further Assurances. After Closing, the Parties agree to take such
further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
documents as are reasonably requested by the other Party for carrying out the
purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, prior to the end of the services
period under the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to provide to Purchaser a complete list of surface
agreements that benefit or burden the Properties.

Purchaser as complete and correct, copies of (A) the certificate of
incorporation of Purchaser, (B) the resolutions of the Board of Directors (or
body of similar power and authority) of Purchaser or its general partner
authorizing the execution, delivery, and performance by Purchaser of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (C) any required
approval by the shareholders, unit holders or other equity holders of
Purchaser of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
certifying the incumbency and true signatures of the officers who execute this
Agreement and any other agreement, certificate or document related hereto or

Section 9.4 Closing Payment and Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments.

(a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the best
information available to Seller, a preliminary settlement statement estimating
the initial Adjusted Purchase Price after giving effect to all adjustments to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price set forth in Section 3.3. The estimate delivered 

in accordance with this Section 9.4(a) less the Deposit shall constitute the
Dollar amount to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing (the "Closing
Payment").

(b) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth
the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price and showing the
calculation of each adjustment, based, to the extent possible, on actual
credits, charges, receipts and other items before and after the Effective Time
no later than the later of (x) thirty (30) days following the Cure Period and
(y) the date on which the Parties or the Title Arbitrator, as applicable,
finally determines all Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts under
Section 4.4 (such later date, the "Final Settlement Statement Date"). Seller
shall, at Purchaser's request, supply reasonable documentation available to
support any credit, charge, receipt or other item included in such statement.
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that
Purchaser proposes be made to Seller's statement no later than sixty (60) days
following Purchaser's receipt thereof. Seller may deliver a written report to
Purchaser during this same period reflecting any changes that Seller proposes
to be made to such statement as a result of additional information received
after the statement was prepared. The Parties shall undertake to agree on the
final statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price no later than ninety (90) after
the Final Settlement Statement Date. In the event that the Parties cannot
reach agreement within such period of time, either Party may refer the
remaining matters in dispute to the Houston, Texas office of Deloitte for
review and final determination by arbitration. The accounting firm shall
conduct the arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent that such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 9.4(b).
The accounting firm's determination shall be made within thirty (30) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on
both Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper amount of any
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the accounting firm shall not
increase the Unadjusted Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by
Seller nor decrease the Unadjusted Purchase Price more than the decrease
proposed by Purchaser, as applicable. The accounting firm shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed matters
submitted by the Parties and may not award damages or penalties to the Parties
with respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the accounting firm. Within ten
(10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of Purchaser's sixty (60)
day review period without delivery of any written report or (ii) the date on
which the Parties finally determine the Adjusted Purchase Price or the
accounting firm finally determines the disputed matters, as applicable, (A)
Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Adjusted Purchase Price
(after deducting the Deposit amount) exceeds the Closing Payment or (B) Seller
shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds the
Adjusted Purchase Price (after deducting the Deposit amount), as applicable.
Any post-Closing payment pursuant to this Section 9.4(b) shall bear interest
from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Prime Rate.

(c) Purchaser shall assist Seller in the preparation of the final statement of
the Adjusted Purchase Price under Section 9.4(b) by furnishing invoices,
receipts, reasonable access to personnel, and such other assistance as may be
requested by Seller to facilitate such process post-Closing. 

(d) All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Seller shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Seller in writing to Purchaser. All payments made or to be made
hereunder to Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer or immediately
available funds to a bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing to
Seller.

ARTICLE 10 
TERMINATION

Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to Closing:

(a) By the mutual prior written consent of the Parties; or

(x) By either Party if Closing has not occurred on or before October 31, 2012.
However, no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.1(b) if the Closing has failed to occur because such Party
negligently or willfully failed to perform or observe in any material respect
its covenants or agreements hereunder.

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or
effect (except for the provisions of Section 5.6, Section 5.22, Section 6.6,
Section 7.1(d), Section 7.3, Article 1, Article 10, Article 13 (other than
Section 13.12, Section 13.15, Section 13.17 and Section 13.18) and Appendix A,
which shall continue in full force and effect) and, without prejudice to its
rights under Section 10.3(a) (if applicable), Seller shall be free immediately
to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber
or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person without any restriction under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the termination of this Agreement under Section 10.1 shall not relieve either
Party, subject to Section 13.11, from liability for any willful or negligent
failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or
covenants contained herein that are to be performed or observed at or prior to
Closing; provided that Seller's remedy shall be solely as set forth in Section
10.3(a).

Section 10.3 Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination.

(e) If Seller terminates this Agreement under Section 10.1(b), and Purchaser
has willfully failed to perform or observe its covenants and agreements or is
in breach of its representations and warranties hereunder, or Closing has
otherwise not occurred as a result of an act or omission of Purchaser (other
than an act or omission expressly permitted by this Agreement), then in
addition to its rights under Section 10.2 above, Seller will, as liquidated
damages for lost opportunities (and not as a penalty), be entitled to receive
(and Purchaser shall direct the Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller) the Deposit
together with any interest or income thereon, free of any claims by Purchaser
or any other Person, as its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the
termination of this Agreement, and Seller in no event shall have any rights
under Section 13.17.

(f) If this Agreement is subject to termination for any reason other than the
reasons set forth in Section 10.1(a) (in which case Seller shall direct the
Escrow Agent to deliver to Purchaser the Deposit and any interest accrued
thereon, free of any claims by Seller or any other 

Person with respect thereto) or Section 10.3(a), Purchaser may either (i)
elect to terminate this Agreement and cause Seller to direct the Escrow Agent
to deliver to Purchaser the Deposit and any interest accrued thereon, free of
any claims by Seller or any other Person with respect thereto, as its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to the termination of this Agreement or (ii) in
lieu of terminating this Agreement, exercise its rights under Section 13.17.

ARTICLE 11

Purchaser's covenants or agreements contained in Article 7 or Article 12; or

(vi) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any

SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF THE
SELLER GROUP.

(h) From and after Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Purchaser Group from and against all Damages incurred, suffered by or
asserted against such Persons:

(i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Seller's breach of Seller's

ownership, use or operation of the Assets that occurs prior to the Closing 

(iv) caused by or arising out of any off-site Environmental Liabilities that

event Seller was not acting as a reasonable and prudent operator, that occurs
prior to the Closing Date; or

(v) caused by or arising out of the Back-In Interest or caused by or arising
out of the Excluded Assets.

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF THE
PURCHASER GROUP.

(I) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this
Section 11.2 contains the Parties' exclusive remedies against each other with
respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties in Article 5, Article 6 and Article 7 and the
affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in the certificate delivered by each Party at Closing pursuant to
Section 9.2(b) or Section 9.3(b), as applicable. Except for the remedies
contained in this Section 11.2, Section 10.2, and Section 10.3, and any other
remedies available to the Parties at Law or in equity for breaches of
provisions of this Agreement other than Article 5, Article 6 and Article 7,
SELLER AND PURCHASER EACH RELEASE, REMISE AND FOREVER DISCHARGE THE OTHER AND
ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL SUCH PARTIES' OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
ADVISORS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS,
LIABILITIES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY,
KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH SUCH PARTIES MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED
ON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF (i) THIS AGREEMENT, (ii) SELLER'S OWNERSHIP,
USE OR OPERATION OF THE ASSETS OR (iii) THE CONDITION, QUALITY, STATUS OR
NATURE OF THE ASSETS, INCLUDING, IN EACH SUCH CASE, RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION
UNDER CERCLA OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, BREACHES OF STATUTORY OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR OTHER TORT ACTIONS, RIGHTS TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND
COMMON LAW RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION, RIGHTS UNDER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SELLER AND
ANY PERSONS WHO ARE AFFILIATES OF SELLER, AND RIGHTS UNDER INSURANCE
MAINTAINED BY SELLER OR ANY PERSON WHO IS AN AFFILIATE OF SELLER, EVEN IF
CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY RELEASED PERSON.

(j) The indemnity of each Party provided in this Section 11.2 shall be for the
benefit of and extend to each Person included in the Seller Group and the
Purchaser Group, as applicable. Any claim for indemnity under this Section
11.2 by any Third Party must be brought and administered by a Party to this
Agreement. No Indemnified Person (including any Person within the Seller Group
and the Purchaser Group) other than the Parties shall have any rights against 

Seller or Purchaser under the terms of this Section 11.2 except as may be
exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to
this Section 11.2(d). The Parties may elect to exercise or not exercise
indemnification rights under this Section 11.2(d) on behalf of the other
Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have
no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction
under this Section 11.2(d).

Section 11.3 Indemnification Actions. All claims for indemnification under
Section 11.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes hereof, (i) the term "Indemnifying Person" when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 11 and (ii) the term "Indemnified Person" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having
the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Person or
Persons pursuant to this Article 11.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 11.2, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this Section
11.3, including the specific details of and specific basis under this
Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified
Person (a "Third Person Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the
Third Person Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with
respect to the Third Person Claim; provided that the failure of any
Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Person Claim as provided in this
Section 11.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations
under Section 11.2 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient
time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend
against the Third Person Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying
Person's ability to defend against the Third Person Claim. In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies
its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Person
Claim under this Article 11. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period whether the Indemnifying
Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it
shall be conclusively deemed to have denied such indemnification obligation
hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such
thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Person Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense
and proceedings, including any 

compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the
Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Person Claim
that the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the
Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-
complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Person may at its own expense
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Person
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 11.3(d).
An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnified Person, settle any Third Person Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect thereto which (i) does not result in a final
resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Third
Person Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Person) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect
the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third
Person Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person
Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the
Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide
indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person
shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days
following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person Claim and (ii) if its
obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed
settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Person Claim over the
objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely
admitted its obligation in writing and assumed the defense of a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to
indemnity therefor.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii)
dispute the claim for such indemnification. If the Indemnifying Person does
not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it
has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such indemnification,
the Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to have disputed such claim for
indemnification.

Section 11.4 Limitation on Actions.

(d) The representations and warranties of the Parties in Article 5 and Article
6 and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in Article 7 and the
corresponding representations and warranties given in the certificates

survive indefinitely. The remainder of this Agreement (including the
disclaimers in Section 5.22) shall survive the Closing without time limit
except (A) as may otherwise be expressly provided herein and (B) for the
provisions of Article 12, which shall survive Closing until sixty (60) days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
extension) for the subject Taxes. Representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim
asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

(e) The indemnities in Section 11.2(a)(ii), Section 11.2(a)(iii), Section
11.2(b)(i) and Section 11.2(b)(ii) shall terminate as of the termination date
of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is
subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case as to matters for
which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the
Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date. The indemnities in
Section 11.2(a)(i), Section 11.2(b)(iii), Section 11.2(b)(iv), and Section
11.2(b)(v) shall continue without time limit.

(f) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section
11.2(b)(i) or Section 11.2(b)(ii) (other than in respect to claims relating to
a breach of a representation or warranty in Section 5.10, Section 5.11,
Section 5.12 or Section 5.15 or a breach of a covenant or agreement in Section
7.4 or Article 12), until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for
all Damages for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser therefor
exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and
then only to the extent such Damages exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price. Purchaser shall not have any liability for any
indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(ii) (other than with respect to claims
relating to a breach of a covenant or agreement in Article 12) or Section
11.2(a)(iii) until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all
Damages for which Claim Notices are delivered by Seller therefor exceeds two
and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to
the extent such Damages exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(g) Except with respect to liability for indemnification under Section
11.2(b)(i) with respect to breaches of covenants and agreements under Article
12, Section 11.2(b)(iii), Section 11.2(b)(iv), or Section 11.2(b)(v), Seller
shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser Group under this Article 11
for aggregate Damages in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price.

(h) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by (i) the amount of
insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with
respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, 

and excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by
the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates) and (ii) an amount equal to the
amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Person or
its Affiliates as a result of such Damages in the year such Damages are
incurred.

(i) Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification or any other remedy
under this Agreement with respect to any Damages or other liability, loss,
cost, expense, claim, award or judgment to the extent attributable to or
arising out of the actions of Purchaser as operator of any of the Properties.

(j) In no event shall (i) any Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate
compensation with respect to the same Damage, liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment under more than one provision of this Agreement and
the various documents delivered in connection with the Closing, and (ii) any
Person be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to a breach by an
Indemnifying Person of any of the representations, warranties or covenants
made or agreed to by such Indemnifying Person hereunder of which such Person

ARTICLE 12 
TAX MATTERS

Section 12.1 Tax Filings. From the Effective Time through the Closing Date,
Seller (or, if applicable, the designated operator) shall be responsible for
filing with the Taxing authorities the applicable Tax Returns for all Asset
Taxes relating to the Assets that are required to be filed on or before the
Closing Date and paying the Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns as due and
owing (provided that to the extent such Taxes relate to the periods from and
after the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to Section 12.2, promptly
following Seller's request (and in accordance with Section 12.2), Purchaser
shall pay to Seller any such Taxes, but only to the extent that such amounts
have not already been accounted for under Section 3.3 and have actually been
paid by Seller to the applicable Governmental Body or designated operator).
Purchaser (or, if applicable, the designated operator) shall be responsible
for filing with the appropriate Taxing authorities the applicable Tax Returns
for all Asset Taxes that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and
paying the Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns as due and owing (provided that
to the extent such Taxes relate to the periods before the Effective Time, as
determined pursuant to Section 12.2, promptly following Purchaser's request
(and in accordance with Section 12.2), Seller shall pay to Purchaser any such
Taxes, but only to the extent that such amounts have not already been
accounted for under Section 3.3 and have actually been paid by Purchaser to
the applicable Governmental Body or designated operator); provided, however,
that in the event that Seller (or a designated operator) is required by
applicable Tax Law to file a Tax Return with respect to Asset Taxes after the
Closing Date that includes all or a portion of a Tax period for which
Purchaser is liable for such Taxes, Seller (or the designated operator) shall
file such Tax Return and shall pay the Taxes reflected on such Tax Return as
due and owing, and promptly following Seller's request (and in accordance with
section 12.2), Purchaser shall pay to Seller all such Taxes allocable to the
period or portion thereof beginning at or after the Effective Time, as
determined pursuant to Section 12.2 (but only to the extent that such amounts
have not already been accounted for under Section 3.3 and have actually been 

Seller to the applicable Governmental Body or designated operator), but only
if such Taxes arise out of the filing of an original return. Seller shall be
entitled to all Tax refunds that relate to any such Taxes allocable to any Tax
period, or portion thereof, ending before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary (including Section 2.4(g)), to the extent that Seller
or Purchaser receives any Tax refund to which Seller or Purchaser (as the case
may be) is entitled, Seller or Purchaser (as the case may be) shall
immediately pay such amount to the other Party to the extent the Adjusted
Purchase Price has not been increased pursuant to Section 3.3 on account
thereof.

Section 12.2 Current Tax Period Taxes. Asset Taxes assessed against the Assets
with respect to the Tax period in which the Effective Time occurs (the
"Current Tax Period"), but excluding severance production or similar Taxes
that are based on quantity of or the value of production of Hydrocarbons and
sales and use Taxes, shall be apportioned between the Parties as of the
Effective Time with (a) Seller being obligated to pay a proportionate share of
the actual amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined by
multiplying such actual Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Current Tax Period prior to the Effective Time and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Tax Period and
(b) Purchaser being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the actual
amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined by multiplying such
actual Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
(including the Closing Date) in the Current Tax Period at and after the
Effective Time and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
Current Tax Period. As described in Section 2.4(g), severance, production and
similar Taxes that are based on quantity of or the value of production of
Hydrocarbons shall be apportioned between the Parties based on the number of
units or value of production actually produced or sold, as applicable, before,
and at or after, the Effective Time. Sales and use Taxes shall be apportioned
between the Parties based on transactions occurring before, and at or after,
the Effective Time. In the event that Purchaser or Seller makes any payment
(directly or indirectly) for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this
Article 12, the applicable Party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in
no event later than ten (10) days after the presentation of a statement
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting Party is
entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount of the reimbursement.

Section 12.3 Purchase Price Adjustments. The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall
be increased pursuant to Section 3.3 by (or Purchaser shall otherwise
reimburse Seller for) the amount of Asset Taxes imposed on the ownership of
the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons from such Assets for all Tax
periods or portions thereof ending before the Effective Time that Seller has
paid on behalf of other working interest owners, royalty interest owners,
overriding royalty interest owners and other interest owners in such Assets
and that have not been recouped by Seller before the Closing Date from such
other working interest owners, royalty interest owners, overriding royalty
interest owners and other interest owners in such Assets. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary (including Section 2.4(g)), to the extent that
Purchaser receives any recoupment of Taxes described in the preceding
sentence, Purchaser shall immediately pay such amount to Seller to the extent
the Adjusted Purchase Price has not been increased pursuant to Section 3.3 on
account thereof. 

Section 12.4 Characterization of Certain Payments. The Parties agree that any
payments made pursuant to this Article 12, Article 11, Section 2.4 or Section
9.4 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 12.5 Withholding Taxes. All payments due to Seller under this
Agreement shall be made net of any applicable deduction or withholding for or
on account of any Tax provided, however, that Purchaser shall provide at least
ten (10) days' notice to Seller if any such amounts will be withheld. In the
event Purchaser is required to withhold or deduct an amount for or on account
of Tax from any payment due under this Agreement, the amount deducted or
withheld shall be treated as paid to Seller for all purposes of this
Agreement.

obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by such Party
and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner. No waiver
of, consent to a change in, or any delay in timely exercising any rights
arising from, any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of, or consent to a change in, other provisions hereof
(whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

Section 13.6 Assignment. No Party shall assign all or any part of this
Agreement, nor shall either Party assign or delegate any of its rights or
duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Party (which
consent may be withheld for any reason) and any assignment or delegation made

shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

Section 13.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including, for purposes of
certainty, the Appendix, Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto), the
documents to be executed hereunder and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to the 

subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,

pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

Section 13.8 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing executed by all Parties and expressly identified as an
amendment or modification.

Section 13.9 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall

CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION

OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SENTENCE, EACH OF PURCHASER AND SELLER, FOR ITSELF
AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 13.12 Recording. As soon as practicable after Closing, Purchaser shall

the appropriate counties as well as with any appropriate governmental agencies
and provide Seller with copies of all recorded or approved instruments.

Section 13.13 Conspicuous. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
APPLICABLE LAW TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ENFORCEABLE, THE PROVISIONS IN THIS
AGREEMENT IN BOLD-TYPE FONT ARE "CONSPICUOUS" FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY
APPLICABLE LAW.

Section 13.14 Time of Essence. This Agreement contains a number of dates and
times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties
intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final date and
time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes
any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to meet any 

performance or rights election date applicable to it on the basis that its
late action constitutes substantial performance, to require the other Party to
show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds. Without limiting the foregoing,
time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in this
Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or
if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any action
taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving
such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such period
during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next
day that is a Business Day.

Section 13.15 Delivery of Records. Seller, at Purchaser's cost and expense,
shall deliver the Records to Purchaser within sixty (60) days following
Closing.

Section 13.16 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction and the remaining terms and provisions
shall remain in full force and effect, unless doing so would result in an
interpretation of this Agreement that is manifestly unjust.

Section 13.17 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and the Parties shall
be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof and immediate
injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy available at law or in
equity, subject to Section 10.3.

Section 13.18 Like-Kind Exchange. Seller and Purchaser agree that either Party
may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets or any portion
thereof as an exchange of like-kind property under Section 1031 of the Code
("Exchange"). Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to use reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the other Party in the completion of such an Exchange including
an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1031(k)-1 and/or IRS Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308 (as modified
by IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-51, 2004-2 C.B. 294). Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign its
rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an exchange
accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in IRS Revenue Procedure
2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308) to effect an Exchange. In connection with any such
Exchange, any exchange accommodation title holder shall have taken all steps
necessary to own the relevant Assets under applicable Law. Each of Seller and
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment of a Party's
rights under this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or any
other Person in connection with the Exchange shall release either Party from,
or modify, any of their respective liabilities and obligations (including
indemnity obligations to each other) under this Agreement, and neither Seller
nor Purchaser makes any representations as to any particular tax treatment
that may be afforded to the other Party by reason of such assignment or any
other actions taken in connection with the Exchange. Any Party electing to
treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an Exchange shall be obligated
to pay all additional 

costs incurred hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for
the cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment
shall agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and
hold such other Party and its Affiliates, officers, directors, partners,
members, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all
liabilities and Taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the
Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the
electing Party's Exchange election.
