---|---|--- 



     | (2) | The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure

In connection with all Court proceedings relating to obtaining the Interim
Order and the Final Order, the Company shall diligently pursue, and the

the Purchaser, the Parent and their legal counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon drafts of all material to be filed with

\- 22 -  connection with the Arrangement (including by providing, on a timely basis
and prior to the service and filing of such material, a description of any
information required to be supplied by the Purchaser and the Parent for
inclusion in such material) and the Company will give reasonable consideration
to the comments of the Purchaser, the Parent and their legal counsel on such
material. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all
material filed by it with the Court in connection with the Arrangement is
consistent in all material respects with the terms of this Agreement and the
Plan of Arrangement. In addition, the Company will not object to legal counsel
to the Purchaser and the Parent making such submissions on the application
for the Interim Order and the application for the Final Order as such counsel
considers appropriate, acting reasonably; _provided_ that the Parent and the
Purchaser will provide the Company and its legal counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon drafts of any such submissions and the
Purchaser and the Parent will give reasonable consideration to the comments of
the Company and its legal counsel on such submissions. The Company will also
provide legal counsel to the Purchaser and the Parent on a reasonably timely
basis with copies of any notice, evidence or other documents served on the

with the Arrangement or serve any such material, and will not agree to modify
or amend materials so filed or served, except as contemplated hereby or with

_provided_ that nothing herein shall require any Party to agree or consent to
any change in the purchase price or other consideration contemplated hereby or
other modification or amendment to such filed or served materials
that expands or increases in any material respect its obligations, or
diminishes or limits in any material respect its rights, set forth in any such
filed or served materials or under this Agreement. If at any time after the
issuance of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Date, the Company is
required by the terms of the Final Order or by Law to return to Court with
respect to the Final Order, it will, whenever reasonably practicable, do so
after written notice to the Purchaser and the Parent.



   Section 2.7 | Employment Matters 
---|--- 

Subject to the completion of the Arrangement (except as required by Law
between the date hereof and the Closing Date):



     | (1) |

Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Parties, each of the Parent and
the Purchaser covenants and agrees, and after the Effective Time will cause
the Company and any successor to the Company to covenant and agree that, the
Company Employees who remain employed with the Company or its Subsidiaries
(the "Continuing Employees") shall, for one year after the Effective Time
(the "Continuation Period"), be provided with (i) base salary or base wage,
bonus and incentive opportunities (excluding any equity based compensation
awards) and (ii) employee benefits including retirement and welfare benefits
(excluding discretionary payments and the ESPP) that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time or, in the Parents discretion, are substantially
comparable to those generally made available to similarly situated employees
of the Parent and its Subsidiaries. Continuing Employees shall remain eligible
for an annual bonus for the bonus year in which the Effective Time occurs,  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 23 - paid at the same time and in a manner as the annual bonuses for the Parents
similarly-situated employees. In determining such bonuses for Continuing
Employees, the Parent shall consider in good faith the actual performance
achieved by the Company for the bonus year in which the Effective Time occurs
through the Closing Date, with adjustments as determined in the Parents
discretion for individual performance and the Companys and the Parents
actual performance following the Closing Date. 
---|--- 



     | (2) | Without limiting the generality of Section 2.7(1), from and
after the Effective Time, the Parent or the Purchaser shall or shall cause the
Company (and any successors to the Company) to assume, honor and
continue during the Continuation Period or, if later, until all obligations
thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Companys individual employment,
severance, retention, termination and change in control plans, policies,
programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in control
severance agreement or other Company Plan between the Company and any Company
Employee) maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any
payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either
alone or in combination with any other event), _it_ _being_ _understood_ that,
subject to the provisions of this Section 2.7, the foregoing shall not be
construed to limit the right of the Parent, the Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend or terminate any such plans, policies,
programs, agreements or arrangements, to the extent permitted by the terms of
such plans, policies, programs, agreements or arrangements. With respect to
each Continuing Employees earned but unused vacation or paid time off
("Rollover PTO") balance as of the Effective Time, the Parent shall honor
such amount, which shall remain available to each Continuing Employee after
the Effective Time to use in accordance with the applicable policy of the
Parent; _provided_ that, to the extent any Continuing Employee has
accrued more than 40 hours of Rollover PTO at the Effective Time, such excess
Rollover PTO shall be paid to the Continuing Employee in cash (less applicable
taxes and withholdings), no later than 10 Business Days after the Effective
Time. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) | Without limiting the generality of Section 2.7(1), during
the six-month period following the Effective Time, if the Parent, the
Purchaser or the Company (following the Closing) terminates the employment of
any Continuing Employee, the Parent or the Purchaser shall or shall cause one
of their Affiliates to, provide to such Continuing Employee severance benefits
that are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including pursuant to any individual
agreement between the Company and such Continuing Employee); _provided_ that
for Continuing Employees in Canada, such severance benefits shall not be less
than the severance benefits required under applicable common law, subject to
any enforceable individual contract of employment. 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) |

The Parent shall (1) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations,
actively-at-work requirements and eligibility waiting periods under
any welfare plans of the Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect
to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents (except, that such
waiver shall not apply to the Parents employee supplemental life insurance
election options, with or without accidental Death and 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 24 - coverage greater than $500,000 or (ii) three times or four times salary, to
the extent such evidence of insurability is required under Contract by the
Parents Employee Supplemental Life Insurance); (2) give each Continuing
Employee and each former employee participating in, or eligible for, coverage
under COBRA as of the Closing Date dollar-for-dollar credit for all co-
payments, deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits incurred by each
Continuing Employee and each former employee participating in, or eligible
for, coverage under COBRA as of the Closing Date and in each case, his or her
eligible dependents during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs
towards applicable co-payments, deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time; and (3) give each Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer
of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) prior to
the Effective Time for all purposes including level of benefits (including
severance benefits), vesting, benefit accrual, and eligibility to participate
under each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such service had been
performed with the Parent, except for any employee benefit plans that are
frozen or grandfathered as of the Effective Time, for purposes of qualifying
for subsidized early retirement benefits (including retirement treatment
under the Parent Stock Plans) or for benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans, or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. 
---|--- 
 



     | (5) | Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by the Parent in
writing no later than 10 Business Days prior to the Effective Time, to the
extent permitted by Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys
401(k) Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") to be terminated effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In the event that the Parent requests that
the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide the Parent
with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by the Parent) not
later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (6) | Except as may be required by Law, prior to making any widely
distributed written or orally binding communications to the Company Employees
pertaining to material compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Parent with a copy of the
intended communication and a reasonable period of time to review and comment
on the communication, consider any such comments in good faith and shall
cooperate with the Parent in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication (the Parents agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Any subsequent communications consistent in all substantive
respects with previously approved communications shall not require the
Parents consent. 
---|---|--- 



     | (7) |

Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (1) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Company Plan; (2) prevent the Parent, Purchaser,
the Company or any of their successors or Affiliates from amending or
terminating any of their benefit plans or, 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 25 - their terms; (3) prevent the Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their
successors or Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any Continuing Employee; or (4) create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by the Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
any of their successors or Affiliates or under any benefit plan which the
Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any of their successors or Affiliates
may maintain.

   Section 2.8 | Company Options and Company RSUs; ESPP 
---|--- 



     | (1) | At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board
and the compensation committee of the Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions to take all steps necessary to effectuate the treatment of the
Company Equity Awards in accordance with the applicable Equity Incentive Plan
and award agreements, as follows: 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | Company Options. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | At the applicable time specified in Section 2.3 of the Plan
of Arrangement, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to
such time and granted prior to January 1, 2014 shall be fully vested, and, at
such time, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company Option to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably
practicable after such time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of Common Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
such time __multiplied__ by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Consideration
over (B) the exercise price per Common Share of such Company Option,
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option which has an exercise price per
Common Share that is greater than or equal to the Consideration shall be
cancelled at the applicable time specified in Section 2.3 of the Plan of
Arrangement for no consideration or payment. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

At the applicable time specified in Section 2.3 of the Plan of Arrangement,
each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to such time and
granted on or after January 1, 2014 shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent an
option to purchase Common Shares and shall be converted into an option to
purchase a number of Parent Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of (x) the number of Common Shares subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to such time and (y) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Common Share of such Company
Option immediately prior to such time __divided__ by (B) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the
number of Parent Shares purchasable pursuant to 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 26 - consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_
_further_ , that in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of
the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of Parent Shares
purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the
foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to
satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as
specifically provided above, following the time of the conversion contemplated
above, each Company Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to
such Company Option immediately prior to such time. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Equity Award Conversion Ratio" means the quotient of (1)
the Consideration  _ _divided__ by (2) the Closing Date VWAP. 
---|--- 



     | (iii) | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Plan of
Arrangement to the contrary, if a Company Option is subject to an employment
agreement with an individual holder in effect as of the date hereof that
provides that such Company Option shall vest solely upon a change of control
involving the Company (without the required occurrence of termination or any
other event), such Company Option shall be treated as set forth in Section
2.8(1)(a)(i) above.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Company RSUs. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | At the applicable time specified in Section 2.3 of the Plan
of Arrangement, (A) any vesting conditions applicable to each Company RSU that
was granted prior to January 1, 2014 shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full (with
performance-based Company RSUs vesting at 200% of the target level applicable
to such performance-based Company RSU), and (B) each such Company RSU
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company
RSU to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after
such time, an amount in cash equal to the Consideration, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment; _provided_ that
with respect to any Company RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted
to be paid at such time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under
the applicable Equity Incentive Plan and award agreement that will not
trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

At the applicable time specified in Section 2.3 of the Plan of Arrangement,
each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, that was granted on or after
January 1, 2014 shall, automatically and without any required action 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 27 - restricted stock unit denominated in Common Shares and shall be converted into
a restricted stock unit denominated in Parent Shares (a "Parent Stock-Based
RSU"). The number of Parent Shares subject to each such Parent Stock-Based RSU
shall be equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
(x) the number of Common Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior
to the applicable time specified in Section 2.3 of the Plan of Arrangement
(based on a level of performance, for performance-based Company RSUs of (1)
166.67% of the target level for any such performance-based Company RSU
granted in 2014 and (2) 133.33% of the target level for any such performance-
based Company RSU granted in 2015) __multiplied__ by (y) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the time
of conversion contemplated above, each such Parent Stock-Based RSU shall
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting
terms) as were applicable to the applicable Company RSU immediately prior to
such time; _provided_ that the level of performance for performance-based
Company RSUs will be permanently fixed at the levels set forth above. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Plan of
Arrangement to the contrary, if a Company RSU is subject to an employment
agreement with an individual holder in effect as of the date hereof that
provides that such Company RSU shall vest solely upon a change of control
involving the Company (without the required occurrence of termination or any
other event), such Company RSU shall be treated as set forth in Section
2.8(1)(b)(i) above, _provided_  that the number of Common Shares subject to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be calculated
based on a level of performance, for performance-based Company RSUs of (1)
166.67% of the target level for any such performance-based Company RSU
granted in 2014 and (2) 133.33% of the target level for any such performance-
based Company RSU granted in 2015. 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) |

Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any necessary
determinations and/or resolutions of the Board or a committee thereof and, if
appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that may be necessary or required
under the ESPP and Law to ensure that (A) except for the three-month offering
period under the ESPP that commenced on January 1, 2015 (the "Final
Offering"), no offering period shall be authorized or commenced on or after
the date of this Agreement; (B) if, with respect to the Final Offering, the
Effective Time shall occur prior to March 31, 2015 (which is the Purchase
Date, as defined in the ESPP), (i) each individual participating in the Final
Offering shall receive notice of the Transactions no later than 10 Business
Days prior to the Effective Time and shall have an opportunity to terminate
his or her outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP, (ii) the Final Offering
shall end immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) any 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 28 - distributed to the relevant participants without interest as promptly as
practicable following such termination; (C) each ESPP participants
accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to purchase Common
Shares in accordance with the ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering
(subject to the provisions of the ESPP regarding the maximum number and value
of shares purchasable per participant); (D) the applicable purchase price for
Common Shares shall not be decreased below the levels set forth in the ESPP as
of the date of this Agreement; (E) no individual shall be permitted to
increase his or her rate of contribution under the ESPP following the date of
this Agreement; and (F) the ESPP shall terminate in its entirety at the
applicable time specified in Section 2.3 of the Plan of Arrangement and no
further rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter. 
---|--- 



     | (3) | If the Parent so elects, Parent may, in its sole discretion,
assume any or all of the Equity Incentive Plans; provided, however, that if
the Parent does not elect to assume such Equity Incentive Plans, the
Company Options and Parent-Stock Based RSUs contemplated under Sections
2.8(a)(ii) and 2.8(b)(ii) shall be granted under the Parent Stock Plans. To
the extent that Parent does not elect to assume one or more of the Equity
Incentive Plans, in response to written notice from Parent delivered not less
than 10 Business Days prior to the Effective Time, at or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company, the Board and the compensation committee of the
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take all steps
necessary to (i) cause such Equity Incentive Plan(s) to terminate at or prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company nor any of their successors or
Affiliates will be required to deliver Common Shares or other capital stock of
the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity
Awards pursuant thereto. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (4) | Parent shall reserve for future issuance a number of Parent
Shares at least equal to the number of Parent Shares that will be subject to
the options to purchase Parent Shares and the Parent Stock-Based RSUs
resulting from the actions contemplated by Section 2.8(1)(a)(ii) and Section
2.8(1)(b)(ii). Not later than the Closing Date, Parent shall have on file with
the SEC an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable
form) with respect to the Parent Shares subject to such options to purchase
Parent Shares and Parent Stock-Based RSUs and shall distribute a prospectus
relating to such Form S-8, and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such options to purchase Parent Shares and
Parent Stock-Based RSUs remain outstanding.  
---|---|--- 



   Section 2.9 | Articles of Arrangement and Effective Date

     | (1) | The Articles of Arrangement shall implement the Plan of

where not prohibited, the waiver by the applicable Party or Parties in whose

Parties.

of documents and signatures as may be agreed upon by the Parties. The date on
which Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date". 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (4) | As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in
any event within two Business Days thereafter (or at such other time as the
Parties may agree in writing), Parent shall cause the Depositary to mail to
each registered holder of a Common Share immediately prior to the Effective
Time, in each case whose Common Shares became the right to receive the
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement: (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to any certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares that were acquired

thereof) to the Depositary, and shall otherwise be in such form as the Company

effecting the surrender of such certificates or shares issued on a non-

following the receipt of the Final Order and the satisfaction or, where not
prohibited, the waiver by the applicable Party or Parties in whose favor the

conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Effective
Date) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, prior to the filing by the Company of
the Articles of Arrangement with the Registrar), provide to the Depositary for
the benefit of the Common Shareholders or cause to be so provided sufficient
cash (to be held in escrow until the Effective Time (the terms and conditions

different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if
a record date therefor shall be declared during such period, then the
Consideration and any other dependent items (including the amounts used in
determining the Equity Award Conversion Ratio) shall be equitably adjusted and

Consideration or other dependent item.



   Section 2.12 | Taxation of Company Options

respect of any payment made to a holder of Company Options in respect of the

\- 42 - ---|--- 



     | (1) |

The Company agrees that, upon request by the Purchaser, the Company shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) effect such reorganizations of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective corporate structure, capital
structure, business, operations and assets or such other transactions as the
Purchaser may request, acting reasonably (including the continuance of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries under the Laws of another jurisdiction
or amending the Organizational Documents of the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries) (each, a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization"); and (ii) cooperate
with the Purchaser and its advisors in order to determine the nature of the
Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations that might be undertaken and the manner in
which they might most effectively be undertaken; _provided_ that the Company
shall be required to take the foregoing actions only to the extent that the
Company determines in good faith that: (a) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations
are not prejudicial or adverse to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(having regard to the indemnities provided herein), or any of the Company
Securityholders; (b) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not impair the
ability of any of the Parties to complete the Arrangement or delay the
completion of the Arrangement; (c) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations are
only effected on the Closing Date and as close as reasonably practicable to
immediately prior to the Effective Time; (d) none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is required to take any action that could reasonably be expected
to result in Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax or other consequences
to, any Company Securityholder incrementally greater than the Taxes or other
consequences to such party in connection with the completion of the
Arrangement in the absence of action being taken pursuant to this Section 4.6;
(e) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not result in any breach by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Contract or any breach by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of their respective Organizational
Documents or Law; (f) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; (g) the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not require the
Company to obtain approval of the Company Securityholders (other than in
respect of the Arrangement Resolution at the Company Meeting); (h) the Pre-
Acquisition Reorganizations do not impact the value or type of Consideration
to be received by Common Shareholders under the Arrangement; (i) the Pre-
Acquisition Reorganizations shall not become effective unless (A) the Parent
and the Purchaser each has irrevocably waived or irrevocably confirmed in
writing the satisfaction of all conditions in its favor under Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 and shall have irrevocably confirmed in writing that each of them
shall promptly and without condition (other than compliance with this Section
4.6) proceed to effect the Arrangement and (B) the Parent or the Purchaser
shall have deposited cash with the Depositary in the manner contemplated in,
and sufficient to satisfy their obligations pursuant to, Section 2.10. The
Parent and the Purchaser waive any breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant by the Company, where such breach is a direct or indirect result of
an action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in good
faith pursuant to a request by the Purchaser in accordance with this Section
4.6. The Purchaser shall provide written notice to the Company of any proposed
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least 15 Business Days prior to the
Effective Time. Upon receipt of such notice, the Purchaser and the Company
shall work co-operatively and use commercially reasonable 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 43 - documentation necessary and do all such other acts and things as are
reasonably necessary, including making amendments to this Agreement or
the Plan of Arrangement, to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization; _provided_ that such amendments do not require the Company to
obtain approval of securityholders of the Company (other than as properly put
forward and approved at the Company Meeting). If the Arrangement is not
completed, the Parent or the Purchaser shall, upon request by the Company (x)
forthwith reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with any proposed Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization; and (y) indemnify the Company for any liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, reasonable costs and expenses, interest awards,
judgements, penalties and Taxes (other than those reimbursed in accordance
with the foregoing) suffered or incurred by the Company in connection with or
resulting from any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization and in connection with or
resulting from reversing or unwinding any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
(where such reversal is determined by the Company to be necessary, acting
reasonably). 
---|--- 



     | (2) | Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company acknowledges that the Purchaser may enter into transactions (the "Bump
Transactions") designed to step up the Tax basis in certain capital property
of the Company for purposes of the Tax Act and agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide information reasonably required by Purchaser and

the obtaining of any such information in order to facilitate a successful
completion of the Bump Transactions or any such other reorganizations or
transactions as is reasonably requested by the Purchaser, _provided_ that the
Company shall not be required to perform any calculations, prepare summaries
or otherwise create records or other work product that is not in existence on
the date hereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company shall be deemed to have complied with this Section 4.6 unless the

comment on, any other press release or other public statements with respect
to the Arrangement and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such

\- 44 - expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action,
arising out of such Persons service as a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Persons (in their
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under Yukon Law and its Organizational Documents in effect on the
date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and the Parent or the Company
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ _further_ that any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or
directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under Yukon Law and

Time, the Organizational Documents of the Company and of its Subsidiaries (or
any of their respective successors) shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than
such provisions set forth in such Organizational Documents in effect as of the
date hereof. The Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries (or any
of their respective successors) to honor and fulfill the contractual
indemnification rights in existence as of the date of this Agreement with any

same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with benefits and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions or actions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Company expend for such policies a premium amount in excess of the amount
set forth in Section 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company and
the Parent for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Company shall, and the Parent shall cause the Company
to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement,

reasonable best efforts to purchase

Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Parent or the Company be required to
expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and,
_provided_ _further_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 
---|--- 
 



     | (4) | If the Parent or the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (a) shall amalgamate, consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such amalgamation, consolidation or merger
or (b) shall liquidate or dissolve or transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then,
and in each such case, the Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Parent or the Company shall assume all
of the obligations set forth in this Section 4.8.

     | (5) | The provisions of this Section 4.8 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons.

shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company, or under any applicable Contracts or
Laws. 
---|---|--- 



   Section 4.9 | Transaction Litigation 
---|--- 

The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to prevent the
entry of (and, if entered, to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned)
any Order that results from any shareholder litigation against the Parties or
any of their respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that any shareholder
litigation related to this Agreement or the Transactions is brought, or, to

Effective Time ("Transaction Litigation") (a) the Company shall reasonably
promptly notify the Parent of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep

regarding the defense of any Transaction Litigation and (c) the Company (i)
shall give due consideration to Parents advice with respect to Transaction

Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing clause (c)(ii), the Company may, without Parents prior written
consent, settle Transaction Litigation to the extent that such settlement only
obligates the Company or its Subsidiaries for (A) the issuance of additional
disclosure and/or (B) the payment of money if the amount of money to be paid
in connection with such settlement does not exceed any insurance proceeds that
the Company reasonably expects to receive with respect to such Transaction
Litigation and any deductible in respect thereof.

thereof) on the Closing Date of all amounts payable under the Existing Credit
Facility and the release of all Liens and pledges of collateral securing such

of financing the payment of all amounts contemplated by this Agreement, any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or required in
connection with the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the Arrangement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 4.10(3) shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any fees, incur or
reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any payment, prior to the occurrence
of the Closing or otherwise incur any liability relating to any such debt
financing, repayment or refinancing that is effective prior to the occurrence
of the Closing, in each case, to the extent the Parent does not have a
reimbursement or indemnity obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to subclause (4) below, (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to (x) enter into any

   Section 4.11 | Takeover Statutes 
---|--- 

If any Takeover Statute or any similar provision in any Organizational
Document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other provision that
would restrict, prohibit or otherwise impair the Parents or the Purchasers
ability to consummate the Transactions, is or may become applicable to the
Transactions, the Company, the Board and the Companys Affiliates shall use
their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take all such
actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on

(after giving effect to the last sentence of this Section 5.3(1)) (and, upon
the occurrence of such failure, such Superior Proposal Notice and such public
announcement shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change) to publicly

that such other Acquisition Proposal (taking into account (x) any
modifications or adjustments made to the Transactions agreed to by the Parent

     | (d) | at the end of the Matching Period, the Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside
legal counsel (and taking into account any amendment or modification to the
terms of this Agreement or the Transactions that the Parent has agreed in
writing to make), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and that the failure to take such action could be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Law; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | prior to or concurrently with taking any such action, the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(c)(ii) and pays
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2. 
---|---|--- 
 

Any material amendment or modification to any such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new Superior Proposal Notice and the Parent shall be afforded a new
Matching Period (except that references to the four Business Day period shall
be deemed to be references to a two Business Day period; _provided_ that such
new Matching Period shall in no event shorten the original Matching Period).

 



\- 51 - contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Arrangement
Resolution at the Company Meeting, the Board may, in response to an
Intervening Event, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (but may not, for
the avoidance of doubt, terminate this Agreement by virtue of such Adverse
Recommendation Change) if and only if: 
---|---|--- 



      | (a) | the Company provides the Parent four Business Days
written notice of its intention to take such action (an "Intervening Event
Notice"), which notice shall describe in reasonable detail such Intervening
Event and specify with reasonable detail the reasons of the Board for
proposing to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change (it being agreed that
neither the delivery of an Intervening Event Notice nor any public
announcement thereof that the Company has determined in good faith it is
required to make under Law shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless and until the Company shall have failed within 24 hours after the end
of the Intervening Event Matching Period (and, upon the occurrence of such
failure, such Intervening Event Notice and such public announcement shall
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change)) to publicly announce that it is
recommending the Transactions (taking into account any modifications or
adjustments made to the Transactions agreed to by the Parent in writing); 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | during the four Business Day period following the
Purchasers receipt of the Intervening Event Notice (the "Intervening Event
Matching Period"), the Board and, if requested by the Parent, the Companys
Representatives, have negotiated in good faith with the Parent (to the extent
the Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
Transactions proposed by the Parent in response to such Intervening Event;
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | at the end of the Intervening Event Matching Period, the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and its outside legal counsel (and taking into account any amendment
or modification to the terms of this Agreement or the Transactions that the
Parent has agreed in writing to make), that the failure to take such action
could be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Law.  
---|---|--- 



   Section 5.4 | Notification of Acquisition Proposals; Certain
Disclosure; Subsidiaries and Representatives 
---|--- 



     | (1) |

In addition to the obligations of the Company under Section 5.2 and Section
5.3, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives receives any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or any request
for non-public information relating to the Company or any Subsidiary (other
than requests for information unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal) or any
request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the
Purchaser orally and in writing of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, offer or request, and the identity of all Persons making the
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request, and shall provide
to the Parent copies of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal,
offer or request (or where no such copies are available, a reasonably detailed
written description thereof). The Company shall keep the Parent reasonably
informed (orally or in writing) on a reasonably current basis of the
status of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and any modification
thereto), and any material developments, discussions and negotiations with
respect thereto, including  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 52 - proposals or similar documents, in each case, offering or proposing to effect
an Acquisition Proposal, and any draft agreements to effect the applicable
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the Parent orally and in
writing if it determines to begin providing information or to begin engaging
in discussions or negotiations relating to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to this Article 5\. The Company shall, subject to applicable restrictions
under Law, prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided
to any Persons, provide to the Parent any non-public information concerning
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that the Company provided to any Person
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided
to the Parent.  
---|--- 



     | (2) | Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board
from: (i) complying with Section 2.17 of Multilateral Instrument 62-104 
_Takeover Bids and Issuer Bids_ and similar provisions under Securities Laws
relating to the provision of a directors circular in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) taking and disclosing to the Common Shareholders,
as applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
U.S. Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the U.S. Exchange Act; (iii)
making any disclosure to any Company Securityholders, if the Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure
to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its duties to such Company
Securityholders or would violate Securities Laws; or (iv) making accurate
disclosure to Company Securityholders of (x) factual information regarding
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or
(y) the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change), so long as any disclosure contemplated by this Section
5.4(2) does not contain an Adverse Recommendation Change.

     | (1) | If a Termination Fee Event occurs, the Company shall pay the
Parent (or its designee) the Termination Fee in accordance with Section
8.2(3). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) | For the purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee" means
$450,000,000, and "Termination Fee Event" means the termination of this
Agreement: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (a) | pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(d)(ii); 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(b)(i) at a time

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(c)(ii); or

this Agreement at the Company Meeting having occurred, if:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

an Acquisition Proposal received after the date of this Agreement has been
publicly announced or, in the case of clause (d)(B), otherwise
communicated to the Company or the Board, prior to, in the case of clause 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 58 - clause (d)(B), the date of termination, and, in the case of clause (d)(A), has

prior to the date of termination; and 
---|--- 



     | (ii) | within one year following the date of such termination, (A)

Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in
clause (i) above) is consummated or effected, or (B) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement to effect any Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition
Proposal referred to in clause (i) above) and such Acquisition Proposal is
later consummated or effected (whether or not within such one year period). 
---|---|--- 
 

For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 1.1, except that references to "20%"
or "80%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%".



     | (3) | If a Termination Fee Event set forth in Section 8.2(2)(c)
occurs, the Termination Fee shall be paid prior to or concurrently with the

occurs in the circumstances set out in Section 8.2(2)(d), the Termination Fee

Any Termination Fee shall be paid by the Company to the Parent by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Parent (or its designee). 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | If the Company is required by Law to deduct or withhold any
Taxes from any payment of a Termination Fee, (i) the Company shall make such
required deductions or withholdings, and (ii) the Company shall remit the
full amount deducted or withheld to the appropriate Governmental Entity in
accordance with Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (5) |

Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee when due, and in
order to obtain such payment, the Parent or the Purchaser commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee
that has become final and non-appealable, the Company shall pay interest on
the Termination Fee from the date that the payment of the Termination Fee was
due to the date of actual payment at the rate equal to the prime rate
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ for the relevant period, together with
the costs and expenses of the Parent or the Purchaser (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. Notwithstanding 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 59 - respect to claims made by or on behalf of a Person based upon, arising out of
or relating to any wilful breach of this Agreement as provided in Section
7.3), in the event that the Termination Fee is paid in accordance with this
Section 8.2, payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy, from and after the termination of this Agreement, of the Parent, the
Purchaser and their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates and other Representatives against the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates
and other Representatives, for any loss or damage based upon, arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and in no event
after payment of the Termination Fee shall the Parent, the Purchaser or any
other such Person seek to recover any other monetary damages or seek any other
remedy based on a claim in law or equity, in Contract, tort or otherwise, with
respect to any loss or damage based upon, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any
way increasing the amount of the Termination Fee, expanding the circumstances
in which the Termination Fee is to be paid or restricting or modifying the
other rights of any Party, in the event of the valid termination of this
Agreement under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable
pursuant to this Section 8.2, it is agreed that the Termination Fee is
liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and the payment thereof in such
circumstances is supported by due and sufficient consideration. 
---|--- 



   Section 8.3 | Expenses 
---|--- 



     | (1) | Except as provided in Section 4.6, Section 4.10, Section 8.2
and Section 8.3(2), all costs, expenses and fees (including out-of-pocket
third party transaction expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Plan of Arrangement and the Transactions, including all costs, expenses
and fees of the Company incurred prior to or after the Effective Time in
connection with, or incidental to, the Plan of Arrangement, shall be paid by
the Party incurring such costs, expenses and fees whether or not the
Arrangement is consummated.

other communication given regarding the matters contemplated by this
Agreement will be sufficient and deemed to be given and received on the date

   Section 8.5 | Injunctive Relief 
---|--- 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the rights of each Party to consummate
the Transactions are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that
if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate
and irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which money damages would
not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in

 



\- 62 -  addition to any other available remedies the Parties may have in equity or
at law, each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or to an injunction restraining any breach or
violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of this
Agreement, consistent with the first sentence of Section 8.11(2), in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware without necessity of posting a bond or other form of
security. In the event that any action or proceeding should be brought in
equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege,
and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
law. If on the Outside Date, there is a pending Action that has been brought
by a Party hereto before a court of competent jurisdiction seeking the
remedies provided for in this Section 8.5, then, without further action, the
Outside Date shall be automatically extended until the date that is five
Business Days after the dismissal, settlement or entry of a final and non-
appealable order with respect to such Action. 



   Section 8.6 | Third Party Beneficiaries 
---|--- 



     | (1) | Except (i) as provided in Section 4.8 and Section 8.13
which, without limiting their respective terms, are intended as a stipulation
for the benefit of the third Persons mentioned in such provision
(the "Covered Persons"), (ii) for the right, after the Effective Time, of the
Common Shareholders immediately prior to the Effective Time to receive the
Consideration and (iii) for the right, after the Effective Time, of
the holders of Company Equity Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time
to receive the payments with respect thereto contemplated by Section 2.8, the
Company and the Parent and the Purchaser intend and hereby agree that this
Agreement will not benefit or create any right or cause of action in favor of
any Person other than the Parties and that no Person, other than the Parties,
shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement set forth herein
for any purpose.  
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | Despite the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge to each of
the Covered Persons their direct rights against the applicable Party under
Section 4.8 and Section 8.13, which are intended for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each applicable Covered Person, his or her heirs
and his or her legal representatives, and for such purpose, the Company or the
Parent and the Purchaser, as applicable, confirms that it is acting as trustee
on their behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions on their behalf;
_provided_ that the Parties further agree that the rights of each of the
Covered Persons, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives as
contemplated by this Section 8.6 shall not arise unless and until the
Effective Time occurs. 
---|---|--- 



   Section 8.7 | Waiver 
---|--- 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Partys
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not
preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.

 



\- 63 - ---|--- 

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company
Disclosure Letter, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and

warranties and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties.



   Section 8.9 | Successors and Assigns 
---|--- 



     | (1) | This Agreement becomes effective only when executed by the
Company, the Parent and the Purchaser. After that time, it will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

     | (2) | Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement are assignable, delegable or transferable (as
the case may be), in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise
without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempted or
purported assignment, delegation or transfer (as the case may be) in violation
of this Section 8.9(2) shall be null and void; _provided_ that the Purchaser
may assign, delegate or transfer (as the case may be) all or part of its
rights under this Agreement to, and all or part of its obligations under this
Agreement may be assumed by, any of its Affiliates if the Purchaser continues
to be liable jointly and severally with such Affiliate, as the case may be,
for all of its obligations hereunder, and such assignment, delegation or
transfer would not be reasonably likely to prevent or delay the Closing or
adversely affect any of the Company Securityholders. 
---|---|--- 



   Section 8.10 | Severability 
---|--- 

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and
the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof.
If any provision of this Agreement, or application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be legal, valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision, or the
application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.



   Section 8.11 | Governing Law; Jurisdiction

RIGHTS OF DISSENT



   3.1 | Rights of Dissent 
---|--- 

Each registered Common Shareholder may exercise dissent rights with respect
to the Common Shares held by such holder ("Dissent Rights") in connection with
the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner set forth in Section 193 of the
YBCA, as modified by the Interim Order, the Final Order and this Section 3.1;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding Section 193 of the YBCA, the written
objection to the Arrangement Resolution must be received by the Company not
later than 5:00 p.m. (Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. time) two Business Days
immediately preceding the date of the Company Meeting. Dissenting Holders who
duly exercise their Dissent Rights shall be deemed to have transferred the
Common Shares held by them and in respect of which Dissent Rights have
been validly exercised to the Purchaser free and clear of all Liens, as
provided in Section 2.3(k) and if they:



     | (a) | ultimately are entitled to be paid fair value for such
Common Shares: (i) shall be deemed not to have participated in the
transactions in Article 2 (other than Section 2.3(k)); (ii) will be
entitled to be paid the fair value of such Common Shares, which fair value,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Part 14 of the YBCA,
shall be determined as of the close of business on the day before the
Arrangement Resolution was adopted at the Company Meeting; and (iii) will not
be entitled to any other payment or consideration, including any payment that
would be payable under the Arrangement had such holders not exercised their
Dissent Rights in respect of such Common Shares; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | ultimately are not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair
value for such Common Shares, shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Common Shares (and
shall be entitled to receive the Consideration in the same manner as such
non-Dissenting Holders). 
---|---|--- 



   3.2 | Recognition of Dissenting Holders 
---|--- 



     | (a) | In no circumstances shall the Parent, the Purchaser, the
Company or any other Person be required to recognize a Person exercising
Dissent Rights unless such Person is the registered holder of those Common
Shares in respect of which such rights are sought to be exercised. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | For greater certainty, in no case shall the Parent, the
Purchaser, the Company or any other Person be required to recognize Dissenting
Holders as holders of Common Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights have
been validly exercised after the completion of the transfer under Section
2.3(k), and the names of such Dissenting Holders shall be removed from the
registers of holders of the Common Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights
have been validly exercised at the same time as the event described in
Section 2.3(k) occurs. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | In addition to any other restrictions under Section 193 of
the YBCA, none of the following shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights:
(i) holders of Company Options or holders of Company RSUs; and (ii) Common
Shareholders who vote or have instructed a proxyholder to vote Common Shares
in favor of the Arrangement Resolution (but only in respect of such Common
Shares).

CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS



   4.1 | Payment of Consideration 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Purchaser and the Parent shall, not later than the third
Business Day following the receipt of the Final Order and the satisfaction or,
where not prohibited, the waiver by the applicable Party or Parties to
the Arrangement Agreement in whose favor the condition is, of the conditions
set out in Article 6 of the Arrangement Agreement (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Effective Date) (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, prior to the filing by the Company of the Articles of
Arrangement with the Registrar), provide to the Depositary or cause to be so
provided sufficient cash to satisfy the aggregate Consideration that the
Common Shareholders are entitled to receive under this Plan of Arrangement,
including in respect of the Aggregate Redemption Amount and the aggregate
Class X Purchase Price (together with such further amounts as may be required
to fund the Company Funding Amount), with the consideration per Common Share
in respect of which Dissent Rights have been exercised being deemed to be the
Consideration for this purpose, net of applicable withholdings in respect of
such payments to Common Shareholders in accordance with Section 4.3.
Such deposited cash shall be held in escrow by the Depositary for the benefit
of the Purchaser or Parent Sub, as the case may be, until the Effective Time
and thereafter for the holders of Common Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time as contemplated in Section 2.3. In the event the amount of
cash shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.3 to
the holders of Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Parent shall promptly deposit additional funds with the Depositary in an
amount sufficient to make such payments. The cash deposited with the
Depositary by or on behalf of the Purchaser and Parent Sub shall be held in an
interest-bearing account, and any interest earned on such funds shall be for
the account of the Purchaser or Parent Sub, as the case may be. Nothing
contained herein and no investment or other losses resulting from investment
or holding by the Depositary of amounts deposited with the Depositary
shall diminish the rights of any holder of Common Shares to receive the
Consideration as provided herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Common
Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3(l) (or, if such Exchanged
Common Shares were issued on a non-certificated basis, such other evidence of
ownership of such Exchanged Common Shares as is satisfactory to the
Depositary, acting  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 16 - Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require, the Common Shareholders providing such
documentation shall be entitled to receive, and the Depositary shall deliver
to such holder, the Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
under the Arrangement in respect of such Common Shares, less any
amounts withheld in accordance with Section 4.3, and any certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Exchanged Common Shares that is not registered in the share
register of the Company, payment may be made and shares may be issued to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Exchanged Common Shares so
surrendered are registered, if such Exchanged Common Shares shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, in each case
satisfactory to the Parent and the Depositary (each acting reasonably), and
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Exchanged Common Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | As soon as practicable after the Effective Date (and not
later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date not less than five
Business Days thereafter subject to any restrictions imposed by Section 409A
of the Code with respect to any Company RSUs as provided for in Section
2.3(j)(ii) of this Plan of Arrangement), the Parent shall cause the Company to
pay the amounts, net of applicable withholdings, to be paid to holders of
Company Options and Company RSUs, either (i) pursuant to the normal payroll
practices and procedures of the Company, or (ii) in the event that payment
pursuant to the normal payroll practices and procedures of the Company is not
practicable for any such holder, by cheque (delivered to such holder of
Company Options or Company RSUs, as applicable, as reflected on the register
maintained by or on behalf of the Company in respect of the Company Options
and Company RSUs, as applicable). With respect to Company RSUs that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without
triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment
shall be made by the Parent at the earliest time permitted under the
applicable Equity Incentive Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. To the extent necessary, the
Parent shall if necessary make a cash contribution to the Company in such
amount as may be reasonably necessary in order to effectuate the payments to
holders of Company Equity Awards. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.1, each certificate (or
other evidence of ownership, if applicable) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Common Shares shall be deemed after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the aggregate
Consideration in lieu of the Common Shares represented thereby as contemplated
in this Section 4.1, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.3. Any
such certificate (or other evidence of ownership, if applicable) formerly
representing Common Shares not  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 17 - Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim by or interest of any former
holder of Common Shares of any kind or nature against or in the Company, the
Parent or the Purchaser. On such date, all Consideration to which such former
holder was entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to the Purchaser
or the Company, as applicable, and shall be paid over by the Depositary
to the Purchaser or as directed by the Purchaser. 
---|--- 



     | (e) | Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary (or the
Company, if applicable) pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement that has not been
deposited as of, or has been returned to the Depositary (or the Company) on
or prior to, or that otherwise remains unclaimed as of, in each case, the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time and any right or claim to payment
hereunder that remains outstanding on the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and the
right of the holder to receive the applicable consideration for the Common
Shares, the Company Options and the Company RSUs pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement shall terminate and be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited to
