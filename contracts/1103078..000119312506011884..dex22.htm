-v- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF ACQUISITION



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF ACQUISITION (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of January 19, 2006, by and among Raser Technologies, Inc., a
Utah corporation (" _Parent_ "), Amp Resources, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Target_ "), Power Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and John H. Stevens, as equityholder
representative (the " _Equityholder Representative_ ").



RECITALS



A. The Board of Directors of Parent believes it is in the best interests of
Parent and its shareholders and the Board of Directors of Target believes
it is in the best interests of Target and its members that Parent acquire
Target through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Target with Target
surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_
"), and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger, this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.



B. At the Effective Time of the Merger, on the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, (i) the Merger will become effective, and (ii)
all of the equity interests of Target which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger will be converted into
the right to receive the consideration set forth herein.



C. A portion of the consideration otherwise payable by Parent in
connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent as security
for the indemnification obligations set forth in this Agreement.



D. Target on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements in connection with the Merger.



E. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
Target shall have obtained the irrevocable approval of the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to (i) an Action
by Unanimous Written Consent, signed by the holders of 100% of the Target
equity interests, and (ii) an Action by Unanimous Written Consent, signed by
certain holders of indebtedness of the Company, pursuant to and in strict
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements and the Target Charter
Documents.



F. Unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms have the meanings
ascribed to them in _Article X_. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises, representations
and other premises set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_.



(a) At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (" _Delaware Law_ ") and the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act (the " _Delaware Act_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Target, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and
Target shall continue as the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent. The surviving entity after the Merger is sometimes referred to
hereinafter as the " _Surviving Entity_ ".

 



1.2 _Effective Time_.



(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as promptly
as practicable following the satisfaction or, if permissible by the express
terms of this Agreement, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, at
the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation,
2795 East Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 300, Salt Lake City, Utah, unless another
time or place is mutually agreed upon in writing by Target and Parent. The
date upon which the Closing occurs shall be referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger in substantially
the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_, with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the time of such filing with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware shall be referred to herein as
the " _Effective Time_ ").



1.3 _Effect of the Merger_.



(a) At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law and the Delaware Act. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Target and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of Target and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.



1.4 _Operating Agreement_. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the
Effective Time, the operating agreement of the Surviving Entity (the "
_Surviving Entity Operating Agreement_ ") shall be amended and restated in its
entirety as of the Effective Time in the form set forth on _Exhibit B_ , until
thereafter amended in accordance with the Delaware Act and as provided in
such operating agreement.



1.5 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. Unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the sole director of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the sole manager of the
Surviving Entity immediately after the Effective Time, to hold the office of
manager of the Surviving Entity in accordance with the provisions of the
Delaware Act and the Surviving Company Operating Agreement of the Surviving
Entity until his successor is duly elected and qualified.



 

-2- 1.6 _Effect of Merger on Target Equity Interests_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation
the escrow provisions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of Target,
Merger Sub, Parent or the holders of any of the following securities, the
following shall occur:



(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub shall
be cancelled and converted into one fully paid and nonassessable membership
interest of the Surviving Entity.



(b) _Target Equity Interests_. Each Target Equity Interest issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Initial
Consideration on the Initial Payment Date and the Subsequent Consideration on
the Subsequent Payment Date, upon the surrender of the certificates
representing such Target Equity Interests in the manner provided for in
_Section 1.8_ hereof (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the
manner provided in _Section 1.8_ hereof).



(c) _Certain Owned Shares_. Each Target Equity Interest which is, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, held in the treasury of Target, or
outstanding and held by Parent, or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.



(d) _Target Options_. Each outstanding Target Option outstanding as of the
Effective Time will be assumed by Parent. Each Target Option so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions of such options immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions),
except that (i) each Target Option will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number of Parent Common Stock) of the number of shares of Target Common Shares
that were issuable upon exercise of such Target Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the per
share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such assumed Target Option will be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) determined by dividing the exercise price per share
of Target Common Shares at which such Target Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio.



1.7 _Adjustments to Total Stock Consideration_. If between the date of this
Agreement and the Subsequent Payment Date, the outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock, or Target Equity Interests shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or interests, by reason of any stock or membership
interest dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, the Total Stock Consideration not
previously disbursed to the Target Equityholders (or former Target
Equityholders, as the case may be) pursuant to _Section 1.6_ hereof shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock (or membership interest)
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange.



 

-3- 1.8 _Exchange Procedures_.



(a) _Surrender of Certificates_.



(i) _Exchange Agent_. The Secretary of Parent, or an institution selected by
Parent, shall serve as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
Merger.



(ii) _Parent to Provide Total Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Initial Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and prior to the Subsequent Payment Date,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Subsequent Consideration
for exchange in accordance with this _Article I_ payable pursuant to _Section
1.6_, in each case, for exchange for the outstanding Target Equity Interests;
_provided, however,_ that Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Fund (as
defined in _Section 7.5(a)_ hereof) the Escrow Shares out of the aggregate
amount of Total Stock Consideration otherwise payable to the Target
Equityholders pursuant to _Section 1.6_ hereof.



(iii) _Exchange Procedures_. At the Closing, the Target Equityholders will
surrender the certificates representing their Target Equity Interests (the "
_Certificates_ ") to the Exchange Agent for cancellation together with duly
completed and validly executed exchange documents in exchange for the right to
receive that portion of the Total Consideration (less the Parent Common Stock
to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holders behalf pursuant to
_Section 7.5(a)_ hereof) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 1.6_ hereof, and the Certificates so surrendered shall be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate outstanding after the
Effective Time will be deemed, for all corporate and limited liability company
purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the portion of
the Total Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares in exchange for
shares of Target Equity Interests (without interest) into which such shares of
Target Equity Interests shall have been so converted. No portion of the Total
Consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to Target Equity Interests formerly represented thereby until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate and the
exchange documents pursuant hereto. 



(iv) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Total Consideration is
to be disbursed pursuant to _Section 1.6_ hereof to any Person other than the
Person whose name is reflected on the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will have paid
to Target or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required
by payment of any portion of the Total Consideration in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established
to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax
has been paid or is not payable.



(v) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.8_, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, nor any party hereto
shall be liable to a holder of Target Equity Interests for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.



(b) _No Further Ownership Rights in Target Equity Interests_. The portion of
the Total Consideration to be paid in respect of the surrender for exchange
of Target Equity Interests in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Target Equity
Interests, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Entity of  



 

-4-  Target Equity Interests which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Section 1.8_.



(c) _Unvested Target Equity Interest_. If any Target Equity Interests
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted purchase agreement or other agreement with Target,
then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such Target
Equity Interests shall also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates
representing such shares may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.
Target shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent will be entitled to exercise any such
repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted purchase
agreement or other agreements.



(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each Target
Equityholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall,
upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s), receive from the Exchange
Agent, at such time as such holder shall receive a Certificate or Certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 1.6_
hereof, an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without

Parent plans or trust relating thereto to accrue or pay for benefits that
relate to any time period prior to the Continuing Employees participation in
the Parent benefit.

Requirements or otherwise.
