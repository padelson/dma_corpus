available funds to a bank account designated  in writing by Seller at least
two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the Initial

SECTION 1.04 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. (a) Not less than three Business
Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Seller  shall prepare in good
faith and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth (i) Seller's good faith estimate of Closing Cash
as of  the Reference Time (" _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Seller's good faith
estimate of Closing Working Capital Excess or Closing Working Capital
Shortfall as of the Reference Time (" _Estimated Closing Working Capital
Excess_ " or "Estimated Closing Working Capital Shortfall", as applicable),
(iii) Indebtedness as of the Reference Time (but giving effect to  any
subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness prior to the Closing) (" _Closing
Indebtedness_ "), (iv) Transaction Expenses incurred but not paid prior to the
Closing (" _Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), (v) the Change of Control
Payments to the extent not paid prior to the Closing ("
_Closing            Change of Control Payments_ ") and (vi) the
Initial Closing Date Amount. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with the Accounting Principles and be accompanied with
reasonable supporting information used by  Seller in the preparation of the
estimates of each component of the Initial Closing Date Amount and invoices or
similar supporting documentation with respect to the estimated Closing
Transaction Expenses set forth in the Estimated Closing  Statement. Prior to
the Closing, Purchaser shall have an opportunity to review the Estimated
Closing Statement and discuss such statement with the persons responsible for
its preparation, and Seller shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to, 
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in good faith to respond to any questions
regarding the Estimated Closing Statement. If Purchaser and Seller mutually
agree to any modifications to any items set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement prior to  the Closing, the Estimated Closing Statement shall be
revised to reflect such modifications, and the document so modified shall
constitute the Estimated Closing Statement. Purchaser's opportunity to review
shall in no event delay the Closing or  the Closing Date and if Purchaser and
Seller disagree on any items set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement at
the end of such review period, without any prejudice to Purchaser's rights
under other clauses of this _Section 1.04_ , Seller's positions shall be
reflected in the Estimated Closing Statement.

 


 

 

(b) Within 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare in
good faith and deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Closing Statement_
")            setting forth (i) Cash as of the Reference Time ("
_Closing Cash_ "), (ii) Closing Working Capital Excess or Closing Working
Capital Shortfall, as applicable, as of the  Reference Time and (iii) the
Final Closing Date Amount. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles.

 


 

 

(c) During the 45 calendar day period following Purchaser's delivery of the
Closing Statement, Seller and any accountants, counsel or financial advisers
retained by Seller in connection with any adjustment to the  Purchase Price
contemplated by this _Section 1.04_ shall be

 


 

 

 

\- 3 -  


 

 

permitted, subject to the execution of customary release and hold harmless
letters, to review the working papers of Purchaser and each Group Company
relating  to the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall become final
and binding upon the parties on the 45th calendar day following delivery
thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement with the
Closing Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Purchaser on or prior to
such date, which disagreement shall be limited to mathematical errors and
calculations of amounts not being made in  accordance with the Accounting
Principles and this Agreement. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and be
accompanied with reasonable supporting documentation. If a Notice of 
Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser within the 45 calendar day period
referred to above, then the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with
this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier
of (i) the date on  which Purchaser and Seller resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement and (ii) the date on which all such disputed matters are finally
resolved in writing by the Independent  Expert pursuant to the procedures set
forth in this _Section 1.04_. During the 45 calendar day period following the
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser and  Seller shall seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of
such 45 calendar day period, Purchaser and Seller shall submit to the 
Independent Expert for review any and all matters that remain in dispute and
were included in the Notice of Disagreement. The parties shall instruct the
Independent Expert to render its decision only as to the disputed matters and
the effect of  its decision on the Closing Statement as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than 45 calendar days after its selection.
Each party shall furnish to the Independent Expert such working papers and
other relevant documents and information  relating to the disputed matters,
and shall provide interviews and answer questions, as the Independent Expert
may reasonably request in connection with its determination of such disputed
matters; provided that no party shall be obligated to  provide access or
information if such party determines, in its reasonable judgment that doing so
may violate any applicable Law, or jeopardize protection of attorney client
privileges. In the event any party (or any of its Affiliates or 
representatives) shall participate in teleconferences or meetings with, or
make presentations to, or otherwise have correspondence with the Independent
Expert, such party shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to) have  any ex parte meetings, teleconference,
presentations or other correspondence with the Independent Expert but shall
ensure that the other party participate in all such teleconferences, meetings,
presentations and receive copies of all such  correspondence. The terms of
the appointment and engagement of the Independent Expert shall be as agreed
upon between the parties in writing.

 


 

 

(d) In resolving any such disputed matter, the Independent Expert (i) shall
act in the capacity of an expert and not as an arbitrator, (ii) shall limit
its review to matters specifically set forth in the Notice of  Disagreement
as a disputed matter (other than matters thereafter resolved by mutual written
agreement of the parties), (iii) shall not assign a value to any disputed
matter greater than the greatest value for such matter claimed by either party
or  less than the smallest value for such matter claimed by either party in
the Closing Statement or in the Notice of Disagreement and (iv) shall make its
determinations in accordance with the Accounting Principles and this
Agreement.

 


 

 

(e) The final determination by the Independent Expert of the matters submitted
to it pursuant to _Section 1.04(c)_ shall (i) be in writing,  (ii) include
the Independent

 


 

 

 

\- 4 -  


 

 

Expert's calculation of the Final Closing Date Amount, (iii) include the
Independent Expert's determination of each matter submitted to it pursuant to
_Section 1.04(c)_ and (iv) include a brief summary of the Independent Expert's
reasons for its determination of each matter.

 


 

 

(f) The resolution of disputed matters by the Independent Expert shall be
final and binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable  and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Expert incurred pursuant to this _Section 1.04_
shall be borne by the Seller and the Purchaser in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of disputed matters submitted to the Independent Expert are
unsuccessfully disputed by  each such party (as finally determined by the
Independent Expert) bears to the total amount of the disputed matters so
submitted, which proportion shall be determined by the Independent Expert.

 


 

 

(g) Within five Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and
binding upon the parties:

 


 

 

(i) if the Final Closing Date Amount is less than the Initial Closing Date
Amount, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to  the bank account designated in
writing by Purchaser; or

 


 

 

(ii) if the Final Closing Date Amount is greater than the Initial Closing Date
Amount, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds  to the bank account designated in
writing by Seller.

 


 

 

(h) During the period from the Closing until such time as the Closing
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties in accordance with
this _Section 1.04_ , Purchaser shall afford, and shall cause each Group
Company to afford, to Seller and any accountants, counsel or financial
advisers retained by Seller in connection with any adjustment to the 
Purchase Price contemplated by this _Section 1.04_ reasonable access during
normal business hours to all the properties, books, Contracts, personnel and
records of the  Group Companies, and, subject to the execution of customary
release and hold harmless letters, the work papers of Purchaser and the Group
Companies, relevant to the adjustments contemplated by this _Section 1.04_ ,
and shall provide, upon Seller's reasonable request, copies of any such books,
Contracts, records and work papers.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.05 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties shall be entitled to deduct  and withhold from any
amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as Purchaser or its Affiliates are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision 
of Tax Law; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall provide Seller with a schedule
of expected withholding amounts with respect to any amount payable to Seller,
together with an  explanation of the legal requirement for such withholding
and including available documentation evidencing such withholding, no later
than 10 Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted and  withheld, and paid over to the appropriate

 


 

 

 

\- 5 -  


 

 

Taxing Authority, such withheld and deducted amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person. Purchaser and 
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in
order to reduce or eliminate any amounts required to be deducted and withheld
pursuant to this Section 1.05.

 


 

 

SECTION 1.06 _Designation of Affiliates_. Prior to, and in any event at least
15 calendar days in advance of, the Closing,  Purchaser may designate, by
written notice to Seller, one or more Affiliates to, at the Closing, acquire
all or part of the Transferred Equity Interests or pay all or any portion of
the Purchase Price, in which event references herein to Purchaser  will be
deemed to refer to such Affiliates, as appropriate; provided, however, that no
such designation will in any event limit or affect the obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement to the extent not performed by such Affiliates.

Purchaser or an  Affiliate of Purchaser of each other Transaction Agreement
to which it is or will be party and the consummation by Purchaser or an

\- 24 -  


 

 

cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or

properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) above, any such
items that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

(b) No Consent of or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with the execution, 
delivery and performance of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements or the consummation of the Transactions, other than (i) the
Required Regulatory Approvals, (ii) those that may be required solely by
reason of the identity of  Seller and the Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates (as opposed to any other third Person) and (iii) those
the failure of which to obtain or make, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser  Material Adverse
Effect.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.04 _Proceedings_. There are not any (a) outstanding Judgments
against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (b)  Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, or (c) investigations by any Governmental Entity that are, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, pending or threatened against Purchaser or any  of
its Affiliates that, in any such case, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.05 _Securities Act_. Purchaser is acquiring the Transferred Equity
Interests for investment only and not with a view  to any public distribution
thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that the Transferred Equity Interests have not
been registered under the  Securities Act or any other federal, state,
foreign or local  securities Law, and agrees that the Transferred Equity
Interests may not be sold,  transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
distributed, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under
the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
available under the Securities Act, and in compliance with any other federal,
state, foreign or local securities Law, in each case, to the extent
applicable.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.06 _Financing_. (a) Purchaser has delivered to Seller true, correct
and complete copies of (i) a fully executed  commitment letter dated on or
about the date of this Agreement (together with all exhibits, annexes,
schedules and term sheets attached thereto and as amended, modified,
supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this 
Agreement in compliance with _Section 5.25_ , the " _Equity Commitment Letter_
") from Guarantor,  providing, subject only to the terms and conditions
therein, for an equity investment in Purchaser in cash in the aggregate amount
set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ ");            and (ii)
a fully executed commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letter dated on or about
the date of this Agreement from the financial institutions identified therein
(as such parties may be supplemented or amended from time to time, the "
_Lenders_ ") (such letters, together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and
term sheets attached thereto and as amended, modified,

 


 

 

 

\- 25 -  


 

 

supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this
Agreement in compliance with _Section 5.25_ , collectively, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Letters_ "), providing, subject only to the terms and conditions
set forth therein, for debt financing in cash in the amounts set forth therein
(collectively, the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity
Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,  neither
of the Financing Letters in the form delivered to Seller has been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated and none of the
obligations or commitments contained therein have been withdrawn,
terminated,  repudiated or rescinded in any respect and, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission is
contemplated. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees and other
fees pursuant to the Financing  Letters or otherwise in connection with the
Financing that are payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement. Assuming
the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Letters, the net
proceeds thereof contemplated by the Financing  Letters (after netting out
applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and
charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of market flex
(including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment 
Letter) will in the aggregate be sufficient to enable Purchaser to consummate
the Transactions on the Closing Date (including the payment of related fees,
costs and expenses) and otherwise perform its obligations hereunder. As of the
date hereof,  each Financing Letter in the form delivered to Seller (x)
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto, (y) is enforceable
in accordance with its terms  against Purchaser and, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights  generally and general
equitable principles (whether considered in a Proceeding in equity or at Law)
and (z) is in full force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, 
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of Purchaser or, to the Purchaser's knowledge, any other party thereto
under any Financing Letter or otherwise cause any portion of the Financing to
be unavailable  or delayed. As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser does
not have any reason to believe that it or any other party to any Financing
Letter will be unable to satisfy any term or condition of any Financing Letter
required to be satisfied by it,  that the conditions thereof will not
otherwise be satisfied, or that the full amount of the Financing will not be
available, in each case on the Closing Date assuming compliance by Seller with
this Agreement and the satisfaction (or to the extent  permitted, waiver) of
the conditions set forth in _Article VI_. The only conditions precedent or
other contingencies (including the market flex provisions) related to the 
obligations of Guarantor to fund the full amount of the Equity Financing and
the Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those expressly
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter,
respectively. As  of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or
any other Contracts, arrangements or understandings to which Purchaser or any
Affiliate thereof is a party related to the Financing other than as expressly
contained in the Financing  Letters and delivered to Seller prior to the date
of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to
consummate the Transactions and after giving immediate effect to the
Transactions and the payment of the Purchase Price and (ii) the accuracy  of
the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Article II_ and
_Article III_   hereof in all material respects, and after giving effect

 


 

 

 

\- 26 -  


 

 

to the Transactions (including the Financing) and the payment of the Initial
Closing Date Payment, Purchaser will be Solvent immediately after the Closing.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.07 _No Additional Representations; No Reliance_. (a) Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that except for the  representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Article II_ and _Article III_ and the  certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_ , neither Seller nor any Group Company
nor any other Person on their behalf has made or makes, and Purchaser has

Companies, or any matter relating to any of them, including their respective
businesses, results of  operations, financial condition, cash flows and

_Section 6.02(c)_ , any other information  relating to Seller, the

representatives, whether orally or in writing, in any "data room", offering

memoranda, management presentations (formal or informal), functional "break-
out" discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf of Purchaser or
its  Affiliates or in any other form in connection with the Transactions
(such information, together with the Projections, " _Transaction Materials_
"), and that any such representations or warranties are expressly disclaimed.

 


 

 

(c) Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that none of Seller, the Group
Companies, their respective Affiliates or any of  their respective
representatives will have or be subject to any liability to Purchaser, its
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives or equityholders or any
other Person resulting from Seller, any Group Company or any Person on their 
behalf making available to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
representatives, or Purchaser's, its Affiliates' or their respective
representatives' or any other Person's use of, any Transaction Materials. In
particular, Purchaser            acknowledges and agrees that (i)
there are uncertainties inherent in preparing and making the Projections, (ii)
Purchaser is familiar with such  uncertainties and (iii) Purchaser is not
relying on the Projections and is taking full responsibility for making its
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of the Projections.

 


 

 

(d) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that no representative of
Seller, the Group Companies or their respective Affiliates has any authority,
express or implied,

 


 

 

 

\- 27 -  


 

 

to make any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements not 
specifically set forth in this Agreement or the certificate delivered pursuant
to _Section 6.02(c)_. Except as expressly set forth in _Article II_ or
_Article III_ and the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_ , no
representation or warranty (express or implied) is made with respect to the
value, condition, non-infringement, merchantability, suitability or fitness
for a particular  purpose as to the Transferred Equity Interests or any of
the properties or assets of the Group Companies.

 


 

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 4.07_ shall limit claims by Purchaser for Actual
Fraud.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.08 _Independent Investigation_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that (a) it is sophisticated and knowledgeable about  the industry in which
the Group Companies operate, (b) it has conducted its own independent
investigation, review and analysis of the Business, results of  operations,
financial condition, cash flows and prospects of the Group Companies, which
investigation, review and analysis was conducted solely by Purchaser and its
representatives, (c) it and its representatives have had the opportunity to 
request access to the books and records, facilities, equipment, Tax Returns,

employees of the Group Companies to discuss the Business of the Group
Companies, and (d) it is purchasing the Transferred Equity Interests based

and not in reliance on any representation or warranty of Seller, the Group
Companies, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives not expressly set forth therein.

 


 

 

SECTION 4.09 _Brokers or Finders_. No agent, broker, investment banker or
other firm or Person is or will be entitled to any  broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, except for any such Person, whose  fees
and expenses will be paid by Purchaser.

Agreement, Purchaser has delivered to Seller the duly  executed limited

SECTION 5.02 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Closing, Seller shall cause each Group Company to  afford to Purchaser and
its accountants, counsel and other representatives and Lenders reasonable
access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to all the
personnel, properties, books, Contracts, Tax Returns and records of each
Group  Company and, during such period, shall furnish to Purchaser any
information concerning any Group Company as Purchaser may reasonably request
(other than any of the foregoing that relate to the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement or any  proposals from other parties relating to any
competing or alternative transactions); provided, however, that Purchaser and
its accountants, counsel and other representatives and Lenders shall conduct
any such permitted activities in such a manner  as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of any Group Company; provided
further, however, that (i) no Group Company shall be required to provide such
access if Seller determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so  could
(A) violate applicable Law or an applicable Judgment or (B) jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection
or other legal privilege (it being understood that Seller and the Group
Companies shall  use

 


 

 

 

\- 32 -  


 

 

commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access in a manner that does
not violate any such Law or Judgment or jeopardize any such privilege or 
protection) and (ii) such access shall not include any Phase II environmental
investigations or any other invasive environmental testing or sampling of, at
or under any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property by or on behalf of
Purchaser, its  accountants, counsel or its other representatives or Lenders.
All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ shall be
directed to the executive officer  or other Person designated by Seller.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.03 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser agrees that the information being
provided to it in connection with the Transactions  (including the terms of
the Transaction Agreements and the contents of the Seller Disclosure Letter)
will remain subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated as of
February 4, 2019, between Purchaser and Seller (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). Effective upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate with respect to information relating to the Group Companies or the 
Business; provided, however, that Purchaser agrees that any and all other
Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
provided to it or any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective
representatives, by Seller or any  of its Affiliates, or any of their
respective representatives, shall remain subject to the terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing, and Purchaser shall
otherwise comply with the Confidentiality Agreement in  accordance with its
terms (including with respect to the non-solicitation of employees of Seller
that are not Continuing Employees). Effective upon the Closing, Seller shall
cause any confidentiality agreements entered into between Seller or the 
Group Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any potential purchaser in a proposed transaction similar to the Transactions,
on the other hand, to be assigned to the Group Companies, such that the Group
Companies and  their Affiliates receive the benefit of, and full right to
enforce, such confidentiality agreements from and after the Closing.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.04 _Efforts to Consummate the Transactions_. (a) On the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller  and Purchaser shall each
use its reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another
standard of performance is expressly provided for herein) to cause the Closing
to occur as promptly as practicable, including taking all  reasonable actions
necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed
on it or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing. Seller and
Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates
to,  take any action (including acquiring or making any investment in any
Person or any division or assets thereof) that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, result in a material delay in the satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ or any of such conditions not being
satisfied.

 


 

 

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) as promptly as practicable file with the appropriate
Governmental Entities any notices and applications necessary to obtain 
clearance under any applicable Laws for the consummation of the Transactions,
including the Required Regulatory Approvals; provided that, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to make
(or cause its  applicable Affiliates to make) an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino-Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_
"),            with respect to the Transactions within 10 Business
Days following the date hereof. Any such filings shall be in compliance with
the requirements of such Laws. Seller and Purchaser

 


 

 

 

\- 33 -  


 

 

shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) furnish each other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in 
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under such Laws. Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) keep each other apprised of the status of any communications
with, and any  inquiries or requests for additional or supplemental
information from, any such Governmental Entities and shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request and shall (and shall cause their  respective Affiliates to) promptly
provide any additional or supplemental information requested in connection
with any filings made hereunder pursuant to such Laws. Any such additional or
supplemental information shall be in compliance with the  requirements of
such Laws. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any clearance
required under such Laws for the consummation of the Transactions (including
the  expiration or early termination of any applicable waiting period) as
promptly as practicable. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall (nor shall permit
any of their Affiliates to) consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing or
extension of any  applicable waiting period at the behest of any Governmental
Entity without the consent of the other.

 


 

 

(c) For purposes of this _Section 5.04_ , the "reasonable best efforts" of
Purchaser shall include (A) contesting and resisting any Proceeding 
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Transactions as
violative of any Law, (B) attempting to have repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable any applicable Law, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Judgment  or temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other restraint or prohibition (an " _Injunction_ "), that is enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental  Entity that would make
the Transactions illegal or would otherwise prohibit or impair or delay the
consummation of the Transactions, (C) proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the 
sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines, assets or
operations of Purchaser or of the Group Companies, (D) conducting its business
or the Group Companies' businesses in a specified manner, or proposing and
agreeing or  permitting to conduct any of such businesses in a specified
manner, including by agreeing to undertakings required by a Governmental
Entity that it or any Group Company will take, or refrain from taking, any
action and (E) otherwise taking or  committing to take actions that after the
Closing Date would limit Purchaser's ability to retain one or more of the
businesses, product lines, assets or operations of Purchaser or any Group
Company, in each case, to the extent necessary to obtain  any clearance
required under applicable Laws for the consummation of the Transactions,
resolve any such objections or avoid or eliminate any such impediments (the
actions described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E), the " _Remedy
Actions_ "); provided, however, that the effectiveness of any such Remedy
Action shall be conditioned upon the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the  contrary in this _Section 5.04_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other
than any Group Company effective upon the Closing)  shall be required to
sell, divest, dispose of or enter into any other arrangements or take any
other Remedy Action with respect to, their businesses, product lines, assets
or operations pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, and the "reasonable best efforts" of Seller shall not include
taking any of the Remedy Actions.

 


 

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.04_ , Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective 
Affiliates to), to the extent permitted

 


 

 

 

\- 34 -  


 

 

by applicable Law, (i) give each other prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry or Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity  with respect to the Transactions, (ii) keep each other
reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry or
Proceeding, (iii) promptly inform each other of any communication (and provide
each other with copies of all written  communications) to or from any
Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions, (iv) consult and cooperate
with each other in good faith in connection with any meetings or oral
communications, formal or informal, with any Governmental Entity in 
connection with the Transactions and provide each other with advance notice
and an opportunity to attend and participate in all such meetings and oral
communications and (v) consult and cooperate with each other in good faith in
connection with,  and provide each other with reasonable advance opportunity
to review and comment upon (and each will consider in good faith the views of
the other in connection with), any filing, registration, declaration, notice,
analysis, appearance,  presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion,
proposal or other communication, oral or written, made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions.

 


 

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) apply to or restrict communications or
other actions by any Group Company with or with respect to Governmental
Entities in connection with its business in the ordinary course of  business
or (ii) give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the operations of any Group Company prior to the Closing.

 


 

 

(f) Prior to the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use its reasonable best efforts (at its own expense) to obtain, and to
cooperate in obtaining, all Consents from Persons (other than any 
Governmental Entity) necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation of
the Transactions; provided, however, that the parties (and their Affiliates)
shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any
obligation or grant  any concession in favor of) any such Person (other than
the reimbursement of such Person's reasonable expenses in connection with
obtaining such Consent).

 


 

 

(g) Subject to the preceding provisions of this _Section 5.04_ , from time to
time, as and when requested by any party hereto, each other party  hereto
shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further actions, as such other party may
reasonably deem  necessary or desirable to consummate the Transactions,
including, in the case of Seller, executing and delivering to Purchaser such
assignments, deeds, bills of sale and other instruments as Purchaser or its
counsel may reasonably request as  necessary or desirable for such purpose.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.05 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing takes place, except as
expressly set forth in any other provision of this  Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.06 _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of twelve months following
the Closing Date (or for such longer period as  required by applicable Law),
Purchaser

 


 

 

 

\- 35 -  


 

 

shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to each Employee of the
Business who is employed by any Group Company as of the Closing Date (each
such  Employee of the Business, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), (i)(A) a base
salary or wages, variable pay and short and long-term incentive compensation
opportunities (including  equity-based compensation opportunities), in each
case, no less favorable than, and (B) other employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B),
those provided to such Continuing Employee  immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) any other terms and conditions of employment required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be required
to grant annual equity-based compensation or to provide any  particular
benefit; _provided_ , that Purchaser provide cash compensation (or other
benefits) (x) in lieu of equity-based compensation or (y) in order to provide
comparable  value in lieu of particular benefits. For twelve months following
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide each Continuing Employee with (A) a
position that is comparable to the type of position held by the applicable
Continuing Employee  immediately prior to the Closing Date, at a geographic
location that is within 20 miles of such Continuing Employee's place of work
immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Continuing Employee's  position and/or geographic location may
be modified by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the
execution of the manufacturing initiative as outlined in _Section  5.06(a)_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and (B) employment terms that are (I)
comparable in the aggregate to the terms of the applicable Continuing
Employee's employment with Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date,
(II)  sufficient to avoid statutory, common law or other severance
obligations and to avoid severance and similar obligations under any
applicable severance benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement
and (III) otherwise comply with  applicable Law and Purchaser's covenants set
forth in this _Section 5.06_. In addition, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide to each Continuing  Employee, whose employment is
terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, severance and termination benefits that are
not less favorable than would have been applicable to such Continuing 
Employee under the relevant severance and termination benefit plans, programs,
policies, agreements or arrangements of any Group Company as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing, taking into account such Continuing
Employee's service  with Seller and its Affiliates (including any Group
Company) and any of their respective predecessors prior to the Closing Date,
as well as service with Purchaser and its Affiliates following the Closing
Date. In addition, in the case of any  former Employee of the Business who is
receiving severance pay or benefits as of the Closing, except in the case of
severance to a Continuing Employee triggered automatically upon the Closing or
as a result of the Pre-Closing Reorganization, the  Group Companies shall
remain responsible for such pay and benefits from and after the Closing, and
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to provide such
pay and benefits for the applicable remaining severance period. Except  as
provided in the Transition Services Agreement, effective as of the Closing,
each Continuing Employee shall cease to participate in any Benefit Plan (other
than any Assumed Benefit Plan) as an active employee.

 


 

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause each
Group Company or Purchaser's other Affiliates to, (i) honor all obligations
under the Assumed Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in  effect
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) recognize all of each Continuing
Employee's accrued and unused vacation and other paid time-off benefits
consistent with the terms of the vacation or similar policies of the Group
Companies applicable  to such Continuing Employee as in effect immediately
prior to the

 


 

 

 

\- 36 -  


 

 

Closing, (iii) no later than March 15, 2020, pay all annual bonuses that are
payable to Continuing Employees with respect to the 2019 fiscal year under
the  annual bonus plans of the Group Companies, and (iv) pay all annual
bonuses that are payable to Continuing Employees with respect to the fiscal
year in which the Closing occurs under the annual bonus plans of the Group
Companies, in the case of  clauses (iii) and (iv), in accordance with the
terms of the applicable annual bonus plan.

 


 

 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause each
Group Company or Purchaser's other Affiliates to, recognize, for all purposes
under all plans, programs and arrangements established or  maintained by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Group
Company) each Continuing Employee's service with Seller and its Affiliates
(including any Group Company) and any of their respective predecessors prior
to the  Closing Date as if such service were with Purchaser or its Affiliates
and to the same extent such service was recognized by Seller or its Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit levels and  benefit accruals (other than accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan, any retiree medical or other post-retirement welfare
benefits); provided that no such recognition of service shall be required to
the extent that it would result in a  duplication of benefits or such service
was not recognized under the corresponding Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing.

 


 

 

(d) (i) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall or shall cause the
applicable Group Company or one of Purchaser's other Affiliates to, assume,
and indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from,  all
employment, labor, compensation, pension, employee welfare and employee
benefits related liabilities, obligations, commitments, claims and losses
relating to each (A) current and former Employee of the Business (or any
dependent or beneficiary  thereof) whether arising, before, on or after the
Closing, and (B) Assumed Benefit Plan (such liabilities, obligations,
commitments, claims and losses, the " _Transferred HR  Liabilities_ ");
provided, that Transferred HR Liabilities shall not include (x) any and all
liabilities relating to Benefit Plans that are not Assumed Benefit Plans and
(y) any and all liabilities relating to severance or termination  payments of
a Continuing Employee triggered automatically upon the Closing or as a result
of the Pre-Closing Reorganization (clauses (x) and (y), the " _Retained HR
Liabilities_ ").             In no event shall any Retained HR
Liabilities be considered Change of Control Payments or included in the
calculation of Indebtedness, Working Capital or Transaction Expenses.

 


 

 

(ii) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement (including with respect
to the Transferred HR Liabilities) or in the Transition Services Agreement,
neither Purchaser nor any of its  Affiliates shall assume or be obligated to
pay, perform or otherwise discharge, and Seller and its Affiliates, as the
case may be, will remain liable to pay, perform and discharge when due all
employment, labor, compensation, pension, employee  welfare and employee
benefits related liabilities, obligations, commitments, claims and losses,
including any Retained HR Liability, relating to each employee of Seller and
its Affiliates (or any dependent or beneficiary of any such employee) other 
than the current and former Employees of the Business (and their dependents
and beneficiaries), that arise out of an event or events that occur at any
time. Except as specifically

 


 

 

 

\- 37 -  


 

 

provided in the Transition Services Agreement, from and after the Closing
Date, none of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have any  liability under
or in respect of (and Seller and its Affiliates shall be indemnified and held
harmless with respect to) (x) the Assumed Benefit Plans, (y) the service of
any current or former Employee of the Business or other service provider (or 
any dependent or beneficiary of any such employee or service provider) to any
Group Company, Purchaser or its Affiliates (other than pursuant to any Benefit
Plan that is not an Assumed Benefit Plan) and (z) the actual or constructive
termination of  a current or former Employee of the Business's employment, in
each case whether arising before, on or after the Closing (in the case of this
clause (z), except in the case of any liability that constitutes a Retained HR
Liability).

 


 

 

(e) Except as specifically provided in the Transition Services Agreement, no
later than the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable
Group Company or Purchaser's other Affiliates to, have in effect  one or more
defined contribution plans that each include a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, "
_Purchaser 's 401(k)  Plan_") that will provide benefits to Continuing
Employees participating in the Seller Rewards Plan as of the Closing Date ("
_Seller 's 401(k) Plan_"). Except  as specifically provided in the Transition
Services Agreement, each Continuing Employee who participates in Seller's
401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date shall become a participant in Purchaser's
401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees  to cause Purchaser's
401(k) Plan to allow each such Continuing Employee to make a "direct rollover"
to Purchaser's 401(k) Plan of the account balances of such Continuing Employee
(including a direct in-kind rollover of promissory notes evidencing  any
outstanding loans) under Seller's 401(k) Plan if such direct rollover is
elected in accordance with applicable Law by such Continuing Employee.
Following a "direct rollover" of such Continuing Employee's account balances,
Seller shall have no  liability for any costs, expenses or damages that may
result from any claim for any benefit alleged to be payable under Seller's
401(k) Plan with respect to such Continuing Employee and such Continuing
Employee's beneficiaries, other than any  costs, expenses or damages that may
result from any claim for any benefit alleged to be payable under Seller's
401(k) Plan arising out of the failure by Seller to administer Seller's 401(k)
Plan in compliance with applicable Law. Effective as of  the date that the
Group Companies that are participating employers in Seller's 401(k) Plan cease
to be participating employers thereunder, Seller shall take all necessary
actions to cause the Continuing Employees who are employed by the Group 
Companies as of such date to become fully vested in all of their account
balances thereunder.

 


 

 

(f) In the event the employment of an Employee of the Business does not
automatically transfer to Purchaser upon the occurrence of the Closing by
operation of applicable Law or pursuant to the transfer of the  Transferred
Equity Interests to Purchaser, no later than 10 calendar days prior to the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall offer employment, effective as of 12:01 a.m.,
local time, on the Closing Date (the " _Transfer Time_ "), to all such
Employees of the Business (each such Employee of the Business, an " _Offer
Employee_ ") who on the Closing  Date are actively at work (each, an "
_Active Employee_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, any such Offer Employee
who is not actively at work on the Closing Date due to a  short-term absence
(including due to vacation, holiday, illness or injury of shorter duration
than a long-term disability, jury duty or bereavement leave) in accordance
with applicable policies of Seller shall

 


 

 

 

\- 38 -  


 

 

be deemed an Active Employee. With respect to each Offer Employee who is not
an Active Employee (an " _Inactive Employee_ "), Purchaser shall make offers
of employment to each such Inactive Employee effective as of the date on which
such Inactive Employee presents himself or herself to Purchaser for active
employment following  the Closing Date to the same extent, if any, as Seller
would be required to reemploy such Inactive Employee in accordance with its
policies as in effect on the Closing Date or applicable Law. Purchaser shall
provide each Offer Employee with an  offer of employment and employment terms
in accordance with Purchaser's covenants in _Section 5.06(a)_. In any
jurisdiction where the employment of an Offer Employee can  transfer
automatically to Purchaser upon the occurrence of the Closing by operation of
applicable Law or pursuant to the transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests
to Purchaser, Purchaser and Seller agree to take, or cause their respective 
affiliates to take, all actions required under applicable Law and all other
actions as are necessary or appropriate such that the employment of such Offer
Employee transfers to Purchaser as of the Transfer Time. Each Offer Employee
who becomes an  employee of Purchaser whether by operation of applicable Law
(including pursuant to the transfer of the Transferred Equity Interests to
Purchaser) or by acceptance of Purchaser's offer of employment shall be
treated as a Continuing Employee. In  the case of any Inactive Employee who
becomes a Continuing Employee following the Closing Date, all references in
this Agreement to the Transfer Time or to the Closing or the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be references to 12:01 a.m. on the date  that such
individual becomes a Continuing Employee. Nothing herein shall be construed as
a representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee by Seller that some or all
of the Employees of the Business will accept the offer of employment from 
Purchaser. If the Offer Employee wishes to accept the offer of employment from
the Purchaser, then the Seller shall waive any requirement on the Offer
Employee concerned to give any period of notice of termination of his or her
employment under  the terms of his or her employment so as to allow the Offer
Employee to commence employment with the Purchaser with effect from the
Transfer Time.

 


 

 

(g)

 


 

 

(i) Except as specifically provided in the Transition Services Agreement,
Purchaser shall cause each Group Company or Purchaser's other Affiliates to,
(A) waive any pre-existing condition,  exclusion, limitation, actively-at-
work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and other welfare
benefit plans established or maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, any Group Company) for  the benefit of
Continuing Employees (including their respective dependents and beneficiaries,
if any), except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion,
limitation, requirement or waiting period would have been applicable to
Continuing  Employees (including their respective dependents and
beneficiaries, if any) under a similar Benefit Plan or any plan, program,
agreement, arrangement or understanding that is required by applicable Laws
immediately prior to the Closing and  (B) provide full credit for any co-
payments, deductibles or similar out-of-pocket payments made or incurred by
Continuing Employees (including their respective dependents and beneficiaries,
if any) prior to the Closing Date for the plan year in  which the Closing
occurs.

 


 

 

 

\- 39 -  


 

 

(ii) Seller shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for the
following under any Benefit Plan that is not an Assumed Benefit Plan: (A) all
medical, vision, dental and  prescription drug claims for expenses incurred
by any Continuing Employee or his or her dependents, (B) all claims for short-
term and long-term disability income benefits incurred by any Continuing
Employee and (C) all claims for group life, travel  and accident, and
accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any
Continuing Employee, in each case, prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall be,
or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for all (x) medical,
vision,  dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any
Continuing Employee or his or her dependents or beneficiaries, if any, (y)
claims for short-term and long-term disability income benefits incurred by any
Continuing Employee and  (z) claims for group life, travel and accident, and
accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any
Continuing Employee, in each case, at any time under any Assumed Benefit Plan
and, other than under an Assumed Benefit Plan,  on or after the Closing,
provided that, to the extent set forth in the Transition Services Agreement,
from and after the Closing, Employees of the Business shall continue to
participate in the Benefit Plans and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall 
reimburse Seller for such participation in accordance with the Transition
Services Agreement. Except in the event of any claim for workers compensation
benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities
shall be deemed  to be incurred as follows: (1) medical, vision, dental
and/or prescription drug benefits (including hospital expenses), upon
provision of the services, materials or supplies comprising any such benefits
and (2) short and long-term disability, life,  accidental death and
dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death,
illness, injury or accident giving rise to such benefits.

 


 

 

(h) With respect to Continuing Employees who are primarily located in the
U.S., a Workers' Compensation Claim shall be covered (A) under a workers'
compensation program of Seller or its Affiliates if the applicable  Workers'
Compensation Event occurred prior to the Closing and (B) under a workers'
compensation program of Purchaser or its Affiliates if the applicable Workers'
Compensation Event occurs on or after the Closing; provided, that a Workers' 
Compensation Event that arises from a repetitive activity that occurs over a
period both preceding and following the Closing shall be deemed to occur on
the date that the applicable Continuing Employee first seeks medical treatment
with respect to  such Workers' Compensation Event.

 


 

 

(i) The Split Dollar Policy will continue in effect following the Closing in
accordance with its terms, and Seller shall retain all liabilities with
respect to the Split Dollar Policy at all times on and after the  Closing and
shall be entitled to all rights and benefits with respect to the Split Dollar
Policy (including the right to recover premiums previously paid with respect
to the Split Dollar Policy prior to or following the Closing by either the
Group  Company or Seller). Neither Seller nor any Group Company shall have
any responsibility to renew the Split Dollar Policy.

 


 

 

 

\- 40 -  


 

 

(j) Seller shall retain all liabilities with respect to the U.S. deferred
compensation plans, the Brunswick Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan and
the Brunswick International Stock Unit Plan and shall make payments  with
respect to such plans when any amounts become due and payable.

 


 

 

(k) Seller shall retain liability for each Existing Seller Equity Award. The
Existing Seller Equity Awards shall be treated in accordance with _Section 
5.06(k)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 


 

 

(l) Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, take all steps necessary under Section 4204 of ERISA such that the
Transactions will not constitute a partial or complete withdrawal from  the
Multiemployer Plan applicable to any Employees of the Business (the "Business
Multiemployer Plan"). Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the sale
of the Business constitutes a bona fide, arm's length sale of assets between
unrelated  parties, and the parties intend that this Agreement be covered by
and satisfy all of the requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA. To that end,
Purchaser agrees and covenants: (i) to contribute for any portion of the plan
year of the sale on and  after the Closing Date and the Surety Period (as
hereinafter defined), to the Business Multiemployer Plan for substantially the
same number of contribution base units, as defined in Section 4001(a)(11) of
ERISA, for which Seller was obligated to  contribute prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) unless a waiver is in effect pursuant to Section 4204(c) of
ERISA, to provide to and for the benefit of the Business Multiemployer Plan,
for the five plan years commencing with the first plan year to  begin after
the Closing Date (the " _Surety Period_ "), either a bond issued by a
corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of Section
412 of ERISA, a  letter of credit or an amount held in escrow by a bank or
similar financial institution, in either case in an amount equal to the
greater of (A) the average annual contribution that Seller was required to
make with respect to the covered operations  for the three plan years
preceding the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, or (B) the annual
contribution that Seller was required to make with respect to the covered
operation for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the Closing 
Date occurs, which bond, letter of credit or such amount held in escrow shall
be paid to the Business Multiemployer Plan, if at any time during the Surety
Period, Purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, withdraws from the
Business  Multiemployer Plan or fails to make any contribution to the
Business Multiemployer Plan when due. If a waiver is not in effect pursuant to
Section 4204(c) of ERISA, Purchaser shall deliver to the Business
Multiemployer Plan by the first day of the  plan year following the Closing
Date, with copies to Seller, either the bond or evidence of the establishment
of an escrow described in the preceding sentence. If Purchaser or any
successor in interest thereto shall withdraw from the Business  Multiemployer
Plan in either a complete or partial withdrawal, as such terms are used in
Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, and withdrawal liability is imposed under
Section 4201 of ERISA, Seller acknowledges that Seller shall be secondarily
liable  to the Business Multiemployer Plan for any withdrawal liability that
it would have had to the Business Multiemployer Plan in the absence of Section
4204 of ERISA. From and after the Closing Date, each Purchaser shall or shall
cause the applicable  Group Company or one of such Purchaser's other
Affiliates to, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from,
liabilities relating to a breach of this Section 5.06(l), including in respect
of any secondary liability pursuant to the  immediately preceding sentence.

shall cause its Affiliates to make the retention payments to the Employees of
the Business pursuant to the Assumed Benefit Plans set forth in  _Section
5.06(m)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms of such
Assumed Benefit Plans as in effect on the Closing Date. Promptly following the
date  on which no further retention payments are due under any such Assumed
Benefit Plan, Purchaser shall submit an invoice to Seller that sets forth, in
respect of each Employee of the Business who received one or more retention
payments thereunder, (i)  the name of such Employee of the Business, (ii) the
amount(s) of the retention payment(s) paid to such Employee of the Business
thereunder and the employer's portion of all withholding, employment, payroll
or similar Taxes with respect thereto, and  (iii) the date(s) of payment.
Seller shall reimburse Purchaser within thirty (30) days of receipt of such
invoice for all retention payments (and Taxes) so paid, provided that any
amounts that are paid prior to the Closing or that constitute  Change of
Control Payments shall not be included on such invoice or reimbursed hereunder
and, provided further, that no amounts eligible for reimbursement pursuant to
this _Section  5.06(m)_ shall be reflected as a liability of any Group
Company in calculating Working Capital hereunder.

 


 

 

(n) Nothing contemplated by this _Section 5.06_ shall be construed as (i)
conferring upon any Person (including any Continuing Employee), other  than
the parties hereto, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) establishing, or constituting an
amendment, modification or termination of, or an undertaking to amend,
establish, modify or  terminate, any compensation or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (iii) requiring Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
to be obligated to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any
period of time after the Closing Date,  or (iv) altering or limiting the
rights of any Group Company to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee or to amend, modify or terminate any compensation or employee benefit

Closing Separate Return for Taxes other than Income Taxes. Seller shall
consider in good faith Purchaser's reasonable comments received by Seller
within either (y) 10 Business Days of Purchaser's receipt of such Pre-Closing

with past practice (except as otherwise required by applicable Law) all Tax
Returns required to be filed by or with  respect to each Group Company for
any Straddle Period, other than a Tax Return with respect to a Seller
Consolidated Group (the " _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ "). Purchaser  shall
deliver any such Straddle Period Tax Return related to Income Taxes and any
other such material Straddle Period Tax Return (or substantially completed
drafts of such Straddle Period Tax Returns) to Seller for review and comment
(i) at least  30 Business Days before it is due in the case of a Straddle
Period Tax Return for Income Taxes or (ii) within a reasonable period of time

good faith, the item or items in  dispute shall be resolved by the
Independent Expert and the dispute resolution procedure of Section 1.04(c)
shall govern. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Seller. If any dispute pursuant to  this Section __

with a copy of any Straddle Period Tax Return not submitted to Seller for
review pursuant to this Section 5.07(a)(iii) no later than ten (10) Business
Days after filing such Straddle Period Tax Return.

 


 

 

 

\- 43 -  


 

 

(iv) At least two Business Days before the due date of any Pre-Closing
Separate Return filed after the Closing Date or any Straddle Period Tax
Return, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount for  which Seller has an

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) in no event shall
Seller be required to provide any Person with any Tax Return or copy of any

Company) or (II) a Seller Consolidated Group (other than a portion of a Tax
Return of a Seller Consolidated Group that relates solely to a Group

other party their Affiliates,  agents and representatives, at such first
party's own expense and at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties,

requests, file for and obtain or cause any Group Company to file for and
obtain, any reduction, refund or credit to which Seller is entitled under this
_Section 5.07(c)_ , and shall remit such reduction, refund or credit to
Seller. Any Payments made to Seller pursuant to this

with applicable Tax Law (the " _Preliminary Allocation_ "). The  Preliminary
Allocation will be final and binding upon the parties solely for purposes of
any payments contemplated by Section 1.03(a).

 


 

 

(ii) Seller and Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to allocate
the Purchase Price (along with any other amounts treated as consideration for
the Transferred Equity Interests for  U.S. Federal income Tax purposes) (x)
among the shares of each Company (the " _Share Allocation_ ") and (y) with
respect to the amount allocated to the shares of Life Fitness,  LLC (" _LF
LLC_ ") (together with the amount of any liabilities of LF LLC that Purchaser

\- 45 -  


 

 

(v) Seller's Proposed Allocation, (A) if Purchaser does not timely object to
Seller's Proposed Allocation or (B) as adjusted to reflect any agreement
between Seller and Purchaser during the  thirty (30) Business Day period
following delivery of Purchaser's notice of objection, shall become final and
binding upon the parties as the Purchase Price Allocation. There shall be no
Purchase Price Allocation if Purchaser and Seller fail to  resolve any
dispute concerning Seller's Proposed Allocation pursuant to _Section
5.07(g)(iv)_.

 


 

 

(vi) Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall (and

Purchase Price Allocation, if any, in connection with any Tax Return,
Proceeding relating to Taxes or otherwise in respect of Taxes, in each  case,

Interests in the Transactions that, absent an election to the contrary, would
result in a reduction in the "Category D attributes" (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-36) of any Group Company pursuant to Treasury 
Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(4)(ii), Seller shall, or shall cause the
relevant Selling Affiliate or the applicable common parent of their
consolidated group to, make an effective election pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)  so that no such reduction in "Category D
attributes" shall occur. Purchasers and Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate in good faith in connection with
determining whether an election is required pursuant to this  Section
5.07(i). Seller shall timely provide Purchasers with a copy of the "Section
1.1502-36 Statement", if any, filed in connection with any election made under
this Section 5.07(i).

 


 

 

(j) _Hungarian Tax Assets_. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.07(b)
and Section 5.07(c), notwithstanding anything herein to the  contrary, Seller
shall have the right to control all Proceedings in respect of the Hungarian

cause its Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives  to, fully and timely cooperate in connection with preparing

\- 46 -  


 

 

Receivables or Hungarian VAT Payables without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if  such settlement or compromise could reasonably be expected to
increase the liability of Purchaser or its Affiliates for Hungarian Tax in a
Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall bear all reasonable out-of-pocket third-
party expenses of Purchaser in  connection with Purchaser's obligations under
this Section 5.07(j) and, Purchaser shall be entitled to retain 5% of the
amount recovered in respect of such Hungarian VAT Receivables within twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.08 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes imposed or levied by reason
of, in connection with or attributable to this  Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be borne
one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller, other than any Transfer Taxes

by Seller. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to prepare and
timely file any Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes and timely pay all
such Transfer Taxes.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.09 _Publicity_. No press release or other public announcement
concerning the Transactions shall be issued by a party  or such party's
Affiliates without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such press
release or public announcement may be required by applicable Law, Judgment
or  any Governmental Entity, in which case the party required to make the
press release or public announcement shall allow the other party reasonable
time to comment thereon in advance of such issuance. The parties agree that
any press releases to be  issued with respect to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement shall be in the form, of substance and with timing agreed
upon by Seller and Purchaser (the " _Announcements_ ").            
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) this _Section 5.09_ shall not apply to any
press release or other public announcement made by any of the parties hereto
which (i) is  consistent with the Announcements and the terms of this
Agreement and does not contain any information relating to Seller, Purchaser
or the Group Companies that has not been previously announced or made public
in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement or (ii) is made in the
ordinary course of business and does not relate specifically to this Agreement
or the Transactions and (b) each of Seller and Purchaser may make internal
announcements to their respective employees that are  consistent with the
parties' prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions. The provisions
of this _Section 5.09_ shall not apply to communications by any party to  its
counsel, accountants, prospective Debt Financing sources (including
communications with respect to communications made in connection with
Purchaser's financing efforts), Guarantors, other professional advisors, its
limited partners and  investors or its prospective limited partners and
investors, in each case who are subject to customary confidentiality

SECTION 5.10 _Names Following Closing_. From and after the Closing, except as
expressly provided in this _Section 5.10_ or in the Trademark License
Agreement, any and all rights of the Group Companies to use the Names shall
terminate as of the Closing and shall immediately revert  to Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Group Companies), along with any and all goodwill
associated therewith. As promptly as practicable following the Closing, but in
no event later than 30 Business Days after the Closing, Purchaser shall 
cause each Group Company to, as applicable, (i) change its legal name to
remove any reference to the Names, (ii) file in each jurisdiction in which
each Group Company is qualified to do business all documents

 


 

 

 

\- 47 -   
 

necessary to reflect such change of name or to terminate its qualification in
such jurisdiction under such name, and (iii) promptly thereafter, provide 
documentation reasonably acceptable to Seller evidencing such name changes and
filings. Purchaser acknowledges that it has no rights or interests, and is not
acquiring any rights or interests, directly or indirectly, through the Group
Companies or  otherwise, to use the Names, except as expressly provided
herein. The Group Companies shall, for a period of 90 calendar days after the
Closing (the " _Transition Period_ "),  be entitled to use the existing
letterheads, policies and procedures and other internal documents and
materials in existence and used in the operation of the business of the Group
Companies as of the Closing, in each case, containing the Names;  provided
that all such uses of the Names shall be in the same form and manner as used
in the business of the Group Companies as of the Closing. No later than the
end of the Transition Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates  (including the Group Companies) to revise all letterheads,
policies and procedures and other internal documents and materials to delete
all references to the Names. Except as expressly provided in this _Section
5.10_ or in the Trademark License Agreement, no other right to use the Names
is granted by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Purchaser, its Affiliates or,
after the Closing, the Group Companies, whether  by implication or otherwise,
and nothing hereunder permits Purchaser, its Affiliates or, after the Closing,
the Group Companies, to use the Names in any manner, or to register or seek to
register, or to permit, cause or assist any third party to  register or to
seek to register, any of the Names in any jurisdiction. After the Transition
Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies) to, cease to, and not at any time thereafter, hold themselves out 
as having any affiliation or association with Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.11 _Records_. (a) Purchaser recognizes that certain records of the
Group Companies may contain information relating  to Subsidiaries, divisions
and businesses of Seller and its Affiliates other than the Group Companies,
and that Seller and its Affiliates may retain copies thereof.

 


 

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group
Companies to, retain, for at least five years after the Closing Date, all
books, records and other documents pertaining to the Group Companies' 
businesses that relate to the period prior to the Closing Date, except for Tax
Returns and related documentation which shall be governed by _Section
5.07(a)(vi)_, and to  make the same available after the Closing Date for
inspection and copying by Seller, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable request. At and after the expiration of such period, if Seller or
any of its Affiliates has previously requested  that such books and records
be preserved, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to, either
preserve such books and records for such reasonable period as may be requested
or transfer such books and records to Seller or its designated  Affiliates at
Seller's expense.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.12 _Non-Solicitation_. (a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates and representatives  not to, directly or
indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate, any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative 
Proposal, (b) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Purchaser) any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any
Alternative  Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal or (c) approve, endorse,
recommend,

 


 

 

 

\- 48 -  


 

 

execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
merger,  acquisition or similar agreement constituting or contemplating any
Alternative Proposal.

 


 

 

(b) No later than five Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Seller
shall, or shall cause its representatives to, (i) terminate any access (other
than access for Purchaser and its Affiliates and  representatives) to any
data room (real or virtual) established by Seller or its representatives in
connection with the Transactions or any other proposed strategic transaction
to the extent involving the Business; (ii) send out notices to any  third
party (other than Purchaser's Affiliates or its representatives) that has
executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection with any
proposed strategic transaction to the extent involving the Business and
received Business  Confidential Information to return or destroy such
Business Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of such
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce the confidentiality  obligations and other
rights thereunder.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.13 _Restrictive Covenants_. (a) For a period of 18 months from the
Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause  its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any of the individuals
named in _Section 5.13_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Restricted
Person_ "); provided, however, that (i) the foregoing restriction shall not
preclude general solicitations (but shall restrict hire) by Seller or its
Affiliates or by  a bona fide search firm that are not targeted at any such
Restricted Persons and (b) the foregoing restriction on solicitation or hire
shall not preclude the hiring of any Restricted Person who has ceased to be
employed by any Group Company at  least nine (9) months prior to commencement
of employment discussions between Seller or its Affiliates and such Restricted
Person.

 


 

 

(b) For a period of 18 months from the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any employee of  Seller or any of
its Affiliates that provides services to Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement; _provided_ , however, that (i) the 
foregoing restrictions on solicitation and hiring shall expire with respect to
the employees named in _Section 9.06(b)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
upon the  expiration or termination of the Transition Services Agreement;
(ii) the foregoing shall not preclude (A) general solicitations by Purchaser
or its Affiliates or by a bona fide search firm that are not targeted at any
such employee or (B) the  hiring of any such employee who (x) has ceased to
be employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates at least nine (9) months prior
to commencement of employment discussions between Purchaser or its Affiliates
and such employee or (y) responds to any  general solicitation placed by
Purchaser or its Affiliates (or by a bona fide search firm) that is not
targeted at such employee.

 


 

 

(c) In order for Purchaser to have and enjoy the full benefit of the Business
and as a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement
(without which Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement),  for a
period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause
its respective Affiliates not to, engage (whether as a provider of products or
services or as an owner, investor, operator, manager, employee, officer,
director,  consultant, advisor, representative or otherwise), directly or
indirectly, anywhere in the world, in any business that develops,
manufactures, sells or markets any products or services provided by

 


 

 

 

\- 49 -  


 

 

the Business as of the Closing Date (any such business, a " _Competitive
Business_ ").             Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties agree that nothing herein shall prohibit Seller and its Affiliates
from: (i) acquiring and thereafter owning (including by way of merger,
consolidation or otherwise), or investing in, any Person or  business if less
than twenty percent (20%) of the gross revenues of such Person or business
(calculated at the time of acquisition or investment) are derived from a
Competitive Business, (ii) acquiring or investing in securities representing
not  more than 10% of the outstanding voting power or equity securities of
any Person, (iii) acquiring or investing in any equity interest in any Person
by any bona fide employee benefit plan of Seller or its Affiliates or (iv)
performing any of its  obligations under any of the Transaction Agreements.

 


 

 

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges, stipulates and agrees, on
behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, that irreparable injury may
result to the other party in the event of a breach of any of the  covenants
or agreements contained in this _Section 5.13_ , and each of Seller and
Purchaser agrees, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, that in
the event of  any such breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions
set forth in this _Section 5.13_ , the non-breaching party shall be entitled,
in addition to any other remedies  available to it, to seek a preliminary
injunction, permanent injunction or other injunctive relief, without posting
any bond or other security, compelling the breaching party to comply with any
and all such provisions. Nothing herein contained  shall be construed as an
election of remedies or as a waiver of any right available to the non-
breaching party under this Agreement or the Law, including the right to seek
damages from such breaching party for a breach of any provision of this 
Agreement, nor shall this clause be construed to limit the rights or remedies
available under applicable Law for any violation of any provision of this
Agreement.

 


 

 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this _Section
5.13_ are necessary for the protection and preservation of the value  and the
goodwill of the Business and are reasonable and valid in geographical and
temporal scope and in all other respects. Accordingly, it is the desire and
intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this _Section 5.13_ be
enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies
applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought and if any
provision of this _Section 5.13_ shall be adjudicated finally to be invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary
in order that such provision be valid  and enforceable, the remainder of
_Section 5.13_ shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect

Closing, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect

modified after the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the

obligations of Seller under this _Section 5.17_ shall not apply to information
which is or becomes generally available to the public after the Closing
without breach of Seller's obligations under this _Section 5.17_.

of, Business Confidential Information if Seller, its Affiliates or their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or  representatives are
requested or compelled to disclose any such Business Confidential Information
by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of applicable
Law; provided that Seller shall (x) to the extent legally permissible and 
reasonably practicable, promptly notify Purchaser of the existence of such
request or requirement and the disclosure that is expected to be made in
respect thereto in each case with sufficient specificity so that Purchaser
may, at its expense, seek  a protective order or other appropriate remedy
and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.17_ and (y) if
requested by Purchaser (at

 


 

 

 

\- 51 -  


 

 

Purchaser's sole cost and expense), assist Seller in seeking a protective
order or other appropriate remedy with respect to such request or requirement.
If  such a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by
Purchaser is not obtained and Seller or any of its Affiliates or their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives is
nonetheless required by such  judicial or administrative process or
applicable Law to disclose any Business Confidential Information, Seller (or
such Affiliate or officer, director, employee, agent or representative) may,
after compliance with the immediately preceding sentence  of this _Section
5.17_ , disclose only that portion of the Business Confidential Information
which is required to be disclosed; provided, however, that Seller and, if 
appropriate, such Affiliate or such officer, director, employee, agent or
representative, exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of such Business Confidential Information, including by
obtaining reasonable  assurances that confidential treatment shall be
accorded any Business Confidential Information so disclosed. Notwithstanding
any disclosure of Business Confidential Information pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, Seller and its  Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives will
continue to be bound by their obligations of confidentiality (including with
respect to any Business Confidential Information so disclosed pursuant to 
the immediately preceding sentence), non-disclosure, restriction on use and
other obligations under this _Section 5.17_.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.18 _Resignations_. Seller shall cause to be delivered to Purchaser

the transactions set forth under the heading "Pre-Closing Reorganization" in
the reorganization plan attached hereto as Exhibit D (the " _Reorganization
Plan_ " and such actions and transactions set forth under such heading, the "
_Pre-Closing  Reorganization_ ") to occur and shall provide Purchaser
evidence thereof reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. The agreements and
instruments to effectuate the Pre-Closing Reorganization shall be in form and
substance reasonably  acceptable to Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser further
agree to comply and will cause their respective Affiliates to comply with the
provisions set forth under the heading "Post-Closing Action" in the
Reorganization Plan.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.21 _Shared Contracts_. (a) From the date hereof until the date that
is three (3) months following the Closing Date,  Seller and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best
efforts to work together (and, if necessary and desirable, to work with the
third party to any Shared Contract) to divide, partially assign,  modify or
replicate (in whole or in part) the respective rights and obligations under
and in respect of any Shared Contract, such that, following the Closing, (i)
Purchaser, an Affiliate of Purchaser or a Group Company is the beneficiary of

division, partial assignment, modification or replication of a Shared Contract
unless and until any necessary Consents are  obtained or made, as applicable.
If Seller and Purchaser or their respective Affiliates, as applicable, are not
able to enter into an arrangement to divide, partially assign, modify or
replicate (in whole or in part) the rights and obligations  under and in
respect of any such Shared Contract prior to the Closing, the Closing shall,
subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the waiver by the parties entitled to the benefit thereof) of the conditions
set  forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions which by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction at the
Closing or waiver of such  conditions), nonetheless take place on the terms
set forth herein and, thereafter and until the earlier of (x) the date that is
three (3) months following the Closing and (y) the date on which the division,
partial assignment, modification or  replication of such Shared Contract is
effected, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate in any commercially reasonable arrangement to provide
that (1) Purchaser, an Affiliate of Purchaser or a Group  Company shall
receive the interest in the benefits and obligations of the Purchaser Portion
under and in respect of such Shared Contract and (2) Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller (other than a Group Company) shall receive the interest in the 
benefits and obligations of the Seller Portion under and in respect of such
Shared Contract. This _Section 5.21(a)_ shall not apply to any Seller Shared
Customer Contract  or Purchaser Shared Customer Contract, which are governed
by _Sections 5.21(b)_ and _5.21(c)_ ,  respectively, and _Section 5.21(d)_.

 


 

 

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts
to work together (and, if necessary and desirable, to work with  the third
party to any Seller Shared Customer Contract) to divide, partially assign,
modify or replicate (in whole or in part) the respective rights and
obligations under and in respect of any Seller Shared Customer Contract, such
that, following  the Closing, (i) Purchaser, an Affiliate of Purchaser or a
Group Company is the beneficiary of the rights and is responsible for the
obligations related to the Purchaser Portion of such Seller Shared Customer
Contract, which rights shall be an  asset of and which obligations shall be a
liability of Purchaser, an Affiliate of Purchaser or a Group Company, and (ii)
Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than a Group Company) is the
beneficiary of the rights and is responsible for the  obligations related to
the Seller Portion of such Seller Shared Customer Contract, which rights shall
be an asset of and which obligations shall be a liability of Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller (other than a Group Company). Nothing in this  Agreement
shall require the division, partial assignment, modification or replication of
a Seller Shared Customer Contract unless and until any necessary Consents are
obtained or made, as applicable. If Seller and Purchaser or their respective 
Affiliates, as applicable, are not able to enter into an arrangement to
divide, partially assign, modify or replicate the rights and obligations under
and in respect of any such Seller Shared Customer Contract prior to the
Closing, the Closing  shall, subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent

thereof) of the conditions set forth in _Article  VI_ (other than those
conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject
to the satisfaction at the Closing or waiver of such conditions), nonetheless
take place on the terms set forth herein and, unless  Purchaser and Seller

 


 

 

 

\- 53 -  


 

 

otherwise agree, thereafter and until the earlier of (x) the date that is
three (3) months following the Closing and (y) the date on which the
subcontracting  of the Purchaser Portion of such Seller Shared Customer
Contract (the "Embedded Purchaser Portion") to Purchaser, an Affiliate of
Purchaser or a Group Company is effected, Seller and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to,  (1) use their reasonable best

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all required Consents to the subcontracting

obligations under and in respect of any Purchaser Shared Customer Contract,
such that,  following the Closing, (i) Seller or an Affiliate of Seller

rights and obligations under and in respect of any such Purchaser Shared
Customer Contract prior to the Closing,  the Closing shall, subject to the

parties entitled to the benefit thereof) of the conditions set forth in
_Article            VI_ (other than those conditions which by their

Portion of such  Purchaser Shared Customer Contract shall be provided by
Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than a Group Company). Nothing in this

reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and
recording or  similar fees, all of which shall be reimbursed as promptly as
reasonably practicable by the party on whose behalf such expenses and fees are

procurement of any asset secured to replace an asset in the course of Seller's
or Purchaser's obligations under _Section 5.21(a)_ , _Section 5.21(b)_ or
_Section 5.21(c)_.

Credit Support Obligations pursuant to which  Seller, its Affiliates (other
than the Group Companies) or third parties provide credit support to the
Business or the Group Companies set forth in Section 5.22(a) of the Seller

to provide replacement guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds or other
assurances of payment, and Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to obtain any
necessary release effective as of the Closing in form and substance

Credit Support Obligations. If Purchaser has not obtained the complete and
unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates and any third party
guarantor from any Credit Support  Obligation set forth in Section 5.22 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter (each such Credit Support Obligation, until such
time as such Credit Support Obligation is so released, a " _Seller 
Continuing Credit Support Obligation_ "), then (i) until such release is
obtained, (A) Purchaser shall continue to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain promptly the complete and unconditional release of Seller,
its  Affiliates and any third party guarantor from each Seller Continuing
Credit Support Obligation and (B) Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the

fronting fee costs and any other out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses
resulting from a Seller Continuing  Credit Support Obligation (" _Assumed
Credit Support Obligations_ ") shall be deemed liabilities of Purchaser.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.23 _Release_. Effective as of Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates and each of their respective  successors, assigns, and
past and present directors, managers, officers and employees, and their
respective heirs, successors and assigns (collectively with Seller, the "
_Releasors_ "),            hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives, releases, discharges, remises and acquits Purchaser, its Affiliates
(including the Group Companies) and each of their respective Affiliates and
each of their respective successors, assigns and past,  present and future
directors, managers, officers and employees, and each of their respective
heirs, successors and assigns, in each case in their capacity as such
(collectively, the " _Releasees_ "),            jointly and
individually, of and from any and all Proceedings and claims, demands,
obligations, causes of action or liabilities arising on or prior to Closing,
out of or in any matter related to (i) the direct or indirect ownership of
the  Transferred Equity Interests or any other interest in any Group Company,
(ii) the termination of Seller's and any Selling Affiliates' status as an
equityholder of the Group Companies as a result of the consummation of the
Transactions,  (iii) actions taken by Group Companies' officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and representatives in connection
with the negotiation, authorization, approval and recommendation of the terms
of the Transactions, (iv) any  rights to revenue, stock, options, or warrants
of, or dividends or other distributions in respect of any Transferred Equity
Interests or any other interest in any Group Companies and (v) any Contract,
transaction, event, circumstance, action,  failure to act or occurrence of
any sort or type, whether know or unknown and which occurred, existed or was
taken or permitted at or prior to the Closing. Seller, for itself and the
other Releasors, hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from,  directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, distributing or
causing to be commenced, any Proceeding of any kind against any Releasees,
based on any of the foregoing. Seller, on behalf of itself and the other
Releasors,  expressly waives, to the full extent that it may lawfully waive,
all rights pertaining to a general release of claims (including Section 1542
of the California Civil Code or any provision of other state or federal Law),
and affirms that it is  releasing all known or unknown claims that it has or
may have against any of the Releasees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this _Section 5.23_ shall release,  waive, discharge, relinquish or
otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any party to the extent arising
out of this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Agreements or any other
agreement entered into by a Releasee in connection with the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Contract, transaction or arrangement between a Group Company, on one hand, and
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than a Group Company), on the other
hand, except for any Contract set forth on _Section 5.24_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, with no further obligation or liability to any Group
Company, and shall provide Purchaser with evidence of such termination in 
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. No such terminated
Contract (including any provision thereof that purports to survive
termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.25 _Financing_. (a) Purchaser shall use, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or  cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject only
to the conditions (including the market flex provisions) set forth in the 
Financing Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect and comply with the Financing Letters, (ii) promptly negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements providing for the Financing on the terms and
subject only to  the conditions (including the market flex provisions) set
forth in the Financing Letters (or on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable (as to the matters that would be prohibited (in an amendment of the
Financing Letter) by clause (A),  (B) or (C) of the next sentence) to
Purchaser than the terms and conditions (including market flex provisions) set
forth in the Financing Letters), (iii) satisfy (and cause its Affiliates to
satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to  Purchaser and its
Affiliates in the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements providing
for the Financing, (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing,

the Financing  Letters are satisfied, (v) enforce its rights and remedies
(including through taking all actions reasonably within its control) under the
Financing Letters and the definitive agreements providing for the Financing
and (vi) comply with its covenants  and other obligations under the Financing
Letters and the definitive agreements providing for the Financing; _provided_
, however, neither this _Section 5.25(a)_ nor any other provision of this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
to commence or prosecute any action, litigation, claim,  arbitration or other
proceeding, at law or in equity, against any Lender or any other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter in order to consummate the Debt Financing.
Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, agree to
or  permit any termination of or amendment or modification to be made to, or
grant any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Letters or the
definitive agreements providing for the Financing if such termination,
amendment, modification or waiver  would (A)(1) reduce (or could have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or the amount of original issue
discount) or (2) reduce the amount of the Debt Financing, in  either case
unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount no later
than the date of such termination, amendment, modification or waiver such that
the aggregate amount of the Financing is sufficient to consummate the 
Transactions on the Closing Date and, after giving effect thereto, the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.06_ shall be true and
correct, (B) impose new  or additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other
provision of the Financing Letters in a manner that  could reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of the
Financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the
Closing Date or (C) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its 
rights and remedies against any other party to any Financing Letter or the
definitive agreements providing for the Financing. Purchaser shall promptly
deliver to Seller copies of any termination, amendment, modification or waiver
to or under any  Financing Letter or the definitive agreements providing for
the Financing. Purchaser will fully pay, or cause to be paid, all commitment
and other fees under or arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter as and
when they become due.

(b) Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide
to Seller copies (including drafts) of the material definitive  agreements
providing for the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall give Seller prompt written
notice of, and keep Seller informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of, (i) any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by  any party to any Financing Letter or definitive agreement
providing for the Financing of which Purchaser becomes aware, (ii) the receipt
of any written notice or other written communication from any Financing source
with respect to any (A) actual  or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Financing Letter or any definitive agreement
providing for the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or any
definitive agreement providing for the Financing  or (B) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Letter or any
definitive agreement providing for the Financing and (iii) the occurrence of
an event or development of which the Purchaser becomes aware that could 
reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters on
the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
any Financing  Letter or the definitive agreements providing for the
Financing (or if at any time for any other reason Purchaser believes that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by
the Financing Letters on the terms and  conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by any Financing Letter or the definitive agreements
providing the Financing). As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within two Business Days of the date Seller delivers to  Purchaser a written
request, Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested by
Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the 
terms and conditions (including any applicable market flex provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, or if Purchaser becomes aware of
any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to make any
portion of the Debt  Financing unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any applicable market flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall (x) promptly notify Seller in writing and
(y) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and  obtain in replacement
thereof, and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements providing for,
alternative debt financing from alternative debt sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions on terms and conditions (including 
market flex provisions) not materially less favorable to Purchaser (or its
Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event or
circumstance (but no  later than the date Purchaser is required to consummate
the Closing in accordance with this Agreement); provided that the failure to
obtain alternative debt financing shall not relieve Purchaser of any
obligations hereunder. Purchaser shall  deliver to Seller complete copies of
all Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (including any Redacted
Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such alternative debt source shall have
committed to provide any portion of the alternative debt  financing. For
purposes of this Agreement, (1) references to the "Financing" shall include
the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 5.25_ , (2) references to the
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended, modified or replaced by this _Section            5.25_ and

other representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") retained by Seller
or any Group Company to provide, in each case at Purchaser's sole cost and
expense, such  reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, including (i)

sessions in each case upon  reasonable advance notice and at mutually
agreeable dates, times and locations and (B) reasonably cooperating with due

the use of its logo in connection with the Debt Financing; provided,  that
such logos are used in a manner that is not intended to and would not
reasonably be likely to harm or disparage any Group Company. Notwithstanding

Debt Financing or authorize the creation of any agreements, documents or

position following the Closing and the passing of such resolutions), in each
case that are not contingent on the Closing or would be effective prior to the

Company and their  respective Affiliates and all of their respective

therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Group Company shall have any liability or obligation under any loan agreement
or any related document or any other agreement or document related to  the

\- 60 -  


 

 

(e) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Closing and the obligations of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to  Purchaser's
consummation of any financing arrangement (including the Financing or any

Financing or any alternative financing) or the availability, grant, provision
or  extension of any financing to Purchaser (including the Financing or any
alternative financing).

 


 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller and
the Company expressly agree that a breach of _Section 4.06_ or _Sections

condition  precedent set forth in _Section 6.03(a)_ or _6.03(b)_ , if,
notwithstanding such breach, the  Purchaser is willing and able to consummate
the Transactions on the Closing Date (and, in fact, does consummate the

SECTION 5.26 _Insurance_. (a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, (i) use reasonable best efforts to maintain the  coverage provided to the

force and effect until the Closing, and (ii) prior to the Closing, report to
the applicable third-party insurance provider under each such applicable
Seller Insurance Policy events, acts, errors, accidents, omissions, incidents,
injuries or other  forms of occurrences to the extent relating to the
Business, any Group Company or the properties, assets, operations, employees,
officers or directors of the Business or any Group Company that, in each case,

based Seller Insurance Policy (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Occurrences_
").

 


 

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to report in good faith to the
applicable third-party insurance provider all Pre-Closing  Occurrences
reasonably requested by Purchaser or any Group Company and otherwise
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser or any Group Company to reasonably ensure
that applicable claim reporting and other applicable material Seller Insurance
Policy  requirements are met, in each case with respect to Pre-Closing
Occurrences, (ii) Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies to comply with the
terms of the applicable Seller Insurance Policy to the extent Seller has
reasonably informed Purchaser of  such terms reasonably in advance of the
time necessary to comply with such terms, (iii) subject to _Article VIII_ ,
Purchaser shall be fully liable for all uninsured or  self-insured amounts in
respect of any Pre-Closing Occurrence, (iv) Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, relinquish any of their respective rights, or take
any actions (other than the making of claims under the Seller  Insurance
Policies) that could reasonably be expected to reduce or otherwise limit the
available coverage for any Pre-Closing Occurrences under any of the Seller
Insurance Policies, (v) Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to,  use reasonable best efforts to obtain the benefit of the
applicable insurance coverage under any applicable Seller Insurance Policy and

Subsidiaries in seeking such insurance proceeds (collectively, " _Recovery
Costs_ ") and (vi) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Group  Companies to,
provide Seller with quarterly updates on the status of reported Pre-Closing
Occurrences and any other information relating to any Pre-Closing Occurrence
reasonably requested by Seller. After the Closing, Seller shall not, and
shall  cause its Subsidiaries to not, release, commute, buy-

 


 

 

 

\- 61 -  


 

 

back or otherwise eliminate (whether in whole or in part) insurance coverage
under any of the applicable Seller Insurance Policies with respect to any
such  Pre-Closing Occurrences.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.26(b)_ to the contrary, with respect to each
known Pre-Closing Occurrence as of the Closing potentially covered  by a
third-party claims-made insurance policy of Seller or its Subsidiaries
(excluding the Group Companies) (each such policy, a " _Seller Claims-Made
Policy_ " and each such  claim, a " _Covered Known Claim_ "), Seller shall
use reasonable best efforts in good faith to obtain insurance coverage for
such Covered Known Claim under the Seller  Claims-Made Policies as though
such Seller Claims-Made Policy were a Seller Insurance Policy and the
provisions of _Section 5.26(b)_ shall apply to such Seller Claims-Made 
Policy mutatis mutandis (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect
to netting and reimbursement of Recovery Costs).

 


 

 

SECTION 5.27 _Purchaser Expenditure; Distribution_. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material  Adverse Effect, from the

rights to obtain any capital stock or other Equity Interests) in  Purchaser.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.29 _Trade Compliance Filings and Payments_. From and after the

compliance with applicable trade and import/export Law (including any duty
drawback claims and protests in respect of the overpayment or refund of
duties)  that, after the Closing, are required to be made under Seller's
federal employer identification number. Any such filing shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, and Seller shall be responsible
for the submission of any  such filing to the applicable Governmental Entity.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.30 _Settlement of 401(k) balances_. On or prior to the Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates  to, settle and
discharge any accrued 401(k) and profit sharing liabilities relating to the
Business as of immediately prior to the Closing, with no further obligations
or liabilities to the Buyer or any Group Companies after the Closing and
Buyer  and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) shall be
indemnified and held harmless by Seller with respect to any such obligations
or liabilities.

 


 

 

SECTION 5.31 _Certain Action_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall,

any liability for any willful and material breach by such party of  the terms
and provisions of this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in _Section
7.03_ ) or to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by
any other  party of its obligations in accordance with, and subject to the
limitations provided in, _Section 9.05_ ) under this Agreement; provided that
Seller's sole right to receive  money damages in the event of a termination
of this Agreement shall be the payment of the Termination Fee when the same is

SECTION 7.03 _Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that Seller shall terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(a)(ii)_ or _Section 7.01(a)(v)_ , or
Purchaser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant  to _Section

_Termination            Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds simultaneously with such termination so long as Seller has
provided Purchaser with wire instructions for such payment (or, otherwise,
within one Business Day following receipt of  such wire instructions), it
being understood that in no event shall Purchaser be required to pay or cause

\- 67 -  


 

 

(b) Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that  without
these agreements, the other party hereto would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to timely pay or cause to be paid any amount
due pursuant to this _Section            7.03_ , and, in order to
obtain the payment, Seller commences a Proceeding which results in a judgment
against Purchaser for the payment set forth in this _Section 7.03_ , 
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such Proceeding, together with interest thereon, from
the date such payment  was required to be made until the date of payment, at
the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

 


 

 

(c) Subject in all respects to Seller's injunction, specific performance and

7.03(b)_ hereof, in the event that this Agreement is terminated and the
Termination Fee is paid to Seller in circumstances for which such fee is
payable pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_ , payment of the Termination Fee shall
be the sole and exclusive damages remedy of Seller and its Affiliates against
Purchaser, Guarantor or any of their respective former,  current or future
general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors,
officers or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") or
the  Lender Related Parties for any loss suffered as a result of the failure
of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions, and upon  payment of such amount when due and payable
hereunder, none of the Purchaser Related Parties (other than the Purchaser
(and the Guarantor to the extent of its Guarantee)) or the Lender Related
Parties shall have any liability or obligation relating  to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions. While Seller may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with _Section 9.05_ and the payment of 
the Termination Fee under _Section 7.03_ , under no circumstances shall Seller
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that
results in a  Closing and any monetary damages, including all or any portion
of the Termination Fee.

 


 

 

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  _Indemnification_

 


 

 

SECTION 8.01 _General Indemnification by Seller_. (a) Subject to the terms
(including the limitations) set forth in this _Article VIII_ , from and after
the Closing, Seller shall (without duplication with respect to any other
payment made pursuant to this Agreement) indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees 
against, and hold them harmless from:

 


 

 

(i) any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, including reasonable and
documented third party legal fees and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ ")
suffered or incurred by Purchaser, its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
equityholders, agents and representatives (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Indemnitees_ ") all Losses (other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which
indemnification is provided under _Section 8.03_ ) to the extent arising or
resulting from:

 


 

 

 

\- 68 -  


 

 

(A) to the extent of any Closing Indebtedness, Closing Transaction Expenses or
Closing Change of Control Payments that should have been reflected in the
Estimated Closing Statement but were not  so reflected; and

 


 

 

(B) any liability arising out of or relating to the Seller Business (including
the ownership or operation thereof), whether any such liability arises before
or after Closing, is known or unknown  or is contingent or accrued; and

 


 

 

(ii) the Specified Losses.

 


 

 

(b) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee and
shall not have any liability under _Section 8.01(a)_ to the extent  the Loss
resulted primarily from any breach of a representation, warranty, agreement or
covenant made or to be performed by Purchaser in this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Except for (i) any specific enforcement remedy to which a party is
entitled pursuant to _Section 9.05_ and (ii) claims of, or causes of  action
arising from, Actual Fraud, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other
Purchaser Indemnitee, agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after the
Closing with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement shall be
pursuant to  the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_.
In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other
Purchaser Indemnitee,  hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than those expressly contemplated
by clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence) it or any
Purchaser Indemnitee may have against  Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates
arising under or based upon this Agreement, any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith or any applicable Law, in each case except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section 8.01(c)_
shall in  any way impair the rights and obligations of Purchaser and Seller
to resolve disputes with respect to the Closing Statement and the calculation
of the Final Closing Date Amount pursuant to _Section 1.04_ , and the fact
that Purchaser may have the right to pursue a claim for indemnification under
_Article VIII_ with respect to any facts  or circumstances shall not operate
to impair the application of _Section 1.04_ in accordance with its terms;
provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser be entitled  to receive
indemnification for any Losses (or Taxes) to the extent the amount of such
Losses (or Taxes) are reflected in the calculation of Closing Working Capital
or Closing Indebtedness and therefore reflected in the calculation of the
Final  Closing Date Amount.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.02 _General Indemnification by Purchaser_. (a) Subject to the terms
(including the limitations) set forth in this _Article VIII_ , from and after
the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller against, and hold it harmless
from, any Loss suffered or incurred by Seller and its Affiliates and  each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, equityholders, agents and
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") (other than any

 


 

 

 

\- 69 -  


 

 

Loss relating to Taxes, for which indemnification is provided under _Section
8.03_ )  to the extent arising or resulting from:

 


 

 

(i) the Assumed Credit Support Obligations; and

 


 

 

(ii) any liability arising out of or relating to the Business (including the
ownership or operation thereof), whether any such liability arises before or
after Closing, whether known or unknown or  is contingent or accrued (except,
with respect to any liabilities arising before the Closing, to the extent any
such liabilities result from facts and circumstances that would also
constitute a breach of a representation or warranty by Seller under  Article
II or III of this Agreement).

 


 

 

(b) Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee and
shall not have any liability under _Section 8.02(a)_ to the extent  the Loss
resulted primarily from any breach of a representation, warranty, agreement or
covenant made or to be performed by Seller in this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Except for (i) any specific enforcement remedy to which a party is
entitled pursuant to _Section 9.05_ and (ii) claims of, or causes of  action
arising from, Actual Fraud, Seller, on behalf of itself and each other Seller
Indemnitee, agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with
respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant to
the  indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VIII_. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Seller, on behalf of itself and each other
Seller Indemnitee, hereby waives,  from and after the Closing, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than those expressly contemplated
by clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence) it or any
Seller Indemnitee may have against Purchaser or any of  Purchaser's
Affiliates arising under or based upon this Agreement, any document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith or any applicable Law, in each
case except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
_Article VIII_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
_Section 8.02(c)_ shall in  any way impair the rights and obligations of
Purchaser and Seller to resolve disputes with respect to the Closing Statement
and the calculation of the Final Closing Date Amount pursuant to _Section
1.04_ , and the fact that Seller may have the right to pursue a claim for
indemnification under _Article VIII_ with respect to any facts or 
circumstances shall not operate to impair the application of _Section 1.04_ in
accordance with its terms; provided, however, that in no event shall Seller be
entitled to  receive indemnification for any Losses (or Taxes) to the extent
the amount of such Losses (or Taxes) are reflected in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness and therefore reflected in the
calculation of the Final Closing  Date Amount.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.03 _Tax Indemnification_. (a) Subject to the terms (including the
limitations) set forth in this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing,
Seller shall (without duplication with respect to any other payment made
pursuant to this Agreement) indemnify Purchaser and its  Affiliates against,
and hold them harmless from, any Losses suffered or incurred by Purchaser and
its Affiliates to the extent arising or resulting from:

 


 

 

(i) all Taxes of any Group Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period;

 


 

 

 

\- 70 -  


 

 

(ii) all Taxes resulting from any breach of any covenant or agreement relating
to Taxes contained in _Section 5.07_ made  or to be performed by Seller or
any of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies solely with respect to
periods prior to the Closing);

 


 

 

(iii) all Taxes (as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any
comparable provision of any applicable Tax Law) of any Person other than any
Group Company for which any Group Company  becomes liable as a result of
being or having been, at any time before Closing, part of any consolidated,
combined, affiliated, aggregated, unitary or similar group for Tax purposes;

 


 

 

(iv) all Taxes of any Person other than a Group Company from which any Group
Company is or becomes liable as a transferee or successor, or by contract,
where such transferee, successor or  contractual liability results from a
transaction or event occurring prior to the Closing; and

 


 

 

(v) all Transfer Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to _Section 5.08_ ;

 


 

 

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be liable under this _Section 8.03_ for any such Taxes, fees
or expenses to the extent such Taxes, fees or expenses (1) are described in
_Section 8.03(b)_ or  (2) result from any Purchaser Tax Act.

 


 

 

(b) Subject to the terms (including the limitations) set forth in this
_Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify 
Seller and its Affiliates against, and hold them harmless from, any Losses
suffered or incurred by Seller and its Affiliates to the extent arising or
resulting from:

 


 

 

(i) all Taxes of any Group Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period;

 


 

 

(ii) all Taxes resulting from any breach of any covenant or agreement relating
to Taxes contained in _Section 5.07_ made  or to be performed by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies but solely with respect
to periods following the Closing);

 


 

 

(iii) all Taxes resulting from any Purchaser Tax Act; and

 


 

 

(iv) all Transfer Taxes allocated to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.08_.

 


 

 

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

 


 

 

(i) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real, personal and intangible
property taxes) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle  Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the Straddle Period; and

 


 

 

 

\- 71 -  


 

 

(ii) Taxes (other than Taxes described in clause (i) above) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be computed (x) as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date and  (y) in the case of any such
Taxes attributable to the ownership of any Equity Interest in a partnership,
other "flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code or any analogous provision of  state,
local or foreign Law), as if the taxable period of such partnership,
"flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date; provided, that Taxes attributable to an
inclusion under  Section 951A of the Code for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be computed pursuant to _Section 8.03(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter.

 


 

 

(d) Any indemnity obligation for Taxes pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ shall
be paid within 30 Business Days after Purchaser or Seller, as  applicable,
makes written demand upon the other party claiming it is entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 8.03_ , but in no case earlier than five
Business Days  prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to
be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.04 _Calculation of Losses; Mitigation_. (a) The amount of any Loss
(including a Tax) for which indemnification is  provided under this _Article
VIII_ shall be (i) net of any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified
party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such  Loss
(including a Tax) (after taking into account costs of collection and any
increase in premium) and (ii) reduced to take account of any Tax benefit
actually realized in the year of the incurrence or payment of the applicable
Loss, as determined  on a with and without basis, by the indemnified party or
any of its Affiliates as a result of the incurrence or payment of the
applicable Loss (including a Tax). The amount of the Loss (including a Tax)
arising out of any item included as a  liability in calculating Closing
Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness, if any, shall be calculated net of
the amount so included.

 


 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or provided under
applicable Law, Losses shall not include Losses that are in the nature of
punitive damages except to the extent any such Losses are awarded and paid 
by an indemnified party with respect to a Third Party Claim.

 


 

 

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability
with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the  other party or
a Seller Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee hereunder, including by using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) resolve any such claim or liability and
(ii) after receiving written notice from the other party regarding such claim
or  liability, mitigate any Loss for which indemnification is sought under
this Agreement; provided, however, that the reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs of such mitigation shall constitute Losses for purposes of this
Agreement.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.05 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless any party pursuant to _Section 8.03_ shall terminate upon
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; provided, however,
that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not  terminate
with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified

 


 

 

 

\- 72 -  


 

 

shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a
good faith claim by delivering a notice of such claim in writing (stating in 
reasonable detail the basis of such claim) pursuant to _Section 8.06_ or
_Section 8.07_ to the  party to obligated to provide the indemnification.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.06 _Indemnification Procedures for Other Than Tax Claims_. (a) Third
Party Claims. In order for a Person (the " _indemnified party_ ") to be
entitled to any indemnification provided for under _Section 8.01_ or _Section
8.02_ in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any third
Person against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
indemnified party must notify the party required to provide indemnification
therefor (the " _indemnifying party_ ") in  writing (and in reasonable
detail) of the Third Party Claim within 10 Business Days after receipt by such
indemnified party of notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the  indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five Business Days after the 
indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the
Third Party Claim.

 


 

 

(b) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the  defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnifying party. Should the indemnifying party so elect in
writing to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party
shall not  be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party
shall have the right to  participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be  liable for the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has not
assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the
indemnified  party shall have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim
in accordance with _Section 8.06(a)_ ). If the indemnifying party chooses to
defend or prosecute a Third  Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the
provision to the indemnifying party of records and  information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to testify and provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the 
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified
party shall not admit any liability with respect to (other than giving
testimony under oath when required to do so), or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party  Claim without the indemnifying party's prior
written consent. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise
or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the  indemnifying party may
recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the
full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim and
which releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such 
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not,
without prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld,

 


 

 

 

\- 73 -  


 

 

conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) injunctive or
other  nonmonetary relief against the indemnified party, including the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the
future activity or conduct of the indemnified party or (ii) a finding or
admission of fault or misconduct by  the indemnified party.

 


 

 

(c) _Other Claims_. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ that
does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected  from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall promptly
deliver written notice of such claim (describing such claim in reasonable
detail) to the indemnifying party. Subject to _Section 8.05_ and _Section
8.08_, the failure by any indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party  from any liability that it
may have to such indemnified party under _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_, 
except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as
a result of such failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the
indemnified party within 60 calendar days following its receipt of such
written notice that the  indemnifying party disputes its liability to the
indemnified party under _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_,  such claim
specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
a liability of the indemnifying party under _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_
and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the
indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount
of the  claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when
the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

 


 

 

(d) _Tax Claims_. Tax Claims shall be governed by _Section 8.07_  and not by
this _Section 8.06_.

 


 

 

(e) _Cybex Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Documents, with respect to  any Cybex
Claims (as defined in the Reorganization Plan), Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates (other than the Group Companies) not to, propose, agree
to or enter into any settlement or compromise without the prior written
consent of  the Purchaser unless such settlement and compromise (i) obligates
the Seller to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such
Cybex Claims and the Specified Losses related thereto and releases the
Purchaser Indemnitees completely in  connection therewith, (ii) would not
result in any injunctive or other nonmonetary relief against any Purchaser
Indemnitee, including the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree
that would restrict the future activity or conduct of any  Purchaser
Indemnitee or (iii) involve a finding or admission of fault or misconduct by
any Purchaser Indemnitee.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.07 _Indemnification Procedures for Tax Claims_. (a)If any Taxing
Authority makes a claim that, if successful, might  result in an indemnity
payment pursuant to Section 8.03 (a "Tax Claim"), the indemnified party shall
promptly (and in any event within 15 Business Days of receipt of written
notice of such Tax Claim) notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in 
reasonable detail) of such Tax Claim. If the indemnified party does not
provide notice of a Tax Claim to the indemnifying party within a reasonably
sufficient period of time to allow the indemnifying party to effectively
contest such Tax Claim,  the indemnifying party shall not be liable to any
indemnified party for such Tax Claim to the extent that the indemnifying
party's position is prejudiced as a result thereof.

 


 

 

 

\- 74 -  


 

 

(b) Except for Tax Claims relating to Straddle Periods, Seller shall have sole
control of all Proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to
Taxes for which Seller has an indemnification obligation  pursuant to
_Section 8.03_ ; _provided_ , that, except with respect to any such Proceeding
that  relates to Taxes of any Seller Consolidated Group, Seller shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed about the status of such Proceeding and Seller
shall permit Purchaser to participate (at Purchaser's sole expense) in such
Proceeding and, if such  Proceeding is a material Proceeding that could
reasonably be expected to impact a Tax position taken by Purchaser or its
Affiliates for a Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall not settle any such
Proceeding without the prior written consent of  Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 


 

 

(c) Except for Tax Claims with respect to a Seller Consolidated Group,
Purchaser shall control all Proceedings with respect to Taxes of the Group
Companies for a Straddle Period; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall keep the
Seller reasonably informed about the status of such Proceeding, shall permit
Seller to participate (at Seller's sole expense) in such Proceeding and shall
not  settle any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 


 

 

(d) If Seller or its designee fail to timely control any Proceeding taken in
connection with a Tax Claim relating to Taxes (x) for which Seller has an
indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 8.03, (y) that are  solely
with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period and (z) that are not related to a
Seller Consolidated Group, Purchaser or its designee shall control such
Proceeding; provided, that, Purchaser shall (i) keep Seller reasonably
informed about the  status of such Proceeding, (ii) permit Seller to
participate (at Seller's sole expense) in such Proceeding and (iii) not settle
any such Proceeding with the prior written consent of Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed.

 


 

 

SECTION 8.08 _Survival of Representations and Covenants_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements  contained in this
Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby shall survive the Closing,
except for (a) the covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be
performed in whole or in part at or after the Closing, which covenants and 
agreements shall survive in accordance with their terms and (b) the covenants
and agreements in _Section 5.07_ , which shall survive the Closing until the
expiration of the  applicable statute of limitations.

foregoing,  no amendments or waivers to the provisions of which the Lender
Related Parties are expressly made third party

 


 

 

 

\- 75 -

SECTION 9.05 _Right to Specific Performance_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of  this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to this _Section 9.05_ ,
the  parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, including in the form of
an injunction or injunctions, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in an
appropriate court of competent  jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.11_,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at
Law or in equity. The right to specific  enforcement shall include the right
of Seller to cause Purchaser to cause the Transactions to be consummated on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
parties hereto further agree (a) to cooperate fully in any  attempt by the
other party to obtain any such equitable remedy, (b) to waive any requirement
for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable
remedy, (c) not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is 
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable Law or inequitable for any
reason, or to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy and (d) that the provisions set forth in _Section 7.03_ are
not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would
result from a breach of this Agreement and shall not be construed to diminish
or otherwise impair in any respect Seller's  right to specific enforcement.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, the parties hereto would not have entered into  this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of
Seller to seek an injunction, specific

performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing
Purchaser's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the
Initial  Closing Date Amount and Purchaser's obligations to effect the
Closing (but not the right of Seller to seek injunctions, specific performance
or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall only be available to
Seller if and only if (i) all  conditions in _Section 6.01_ and _6.02_ were
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions  which by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing and which are capable of being satisfied in full
at such time) at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur,
but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii)  the Debt
Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed
that if the  Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would
take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to
occur.
