Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Matrix Merger Co., a Delaware corporation
and a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and, solely in its capacity as and solely
to the extent applicable, the Representative, shall each be referred to herein
from time to time as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_."
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company in a reverse subsidiary
merger transaction on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have
each (i) determined that the Merger (as defined below) is fair, advisable and
in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders and (ii)
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub are each
recommending to their respective stockholders the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;
and

  

WHEREAS, the Company expects that within twenty-four (24) hours of the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I 
  
  
  _THE MERGER_

  

1.01 _The_ _Merger_.

  

    

(a)

  |  

On the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a certificate of merger
substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware and make all other filings required by the DGCL in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree
and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed to all
the assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be
subject to all of the Liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

   
---|--- 
  

  

1.02 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders thereof:

  

    

(a)

  |  

 _Conversion of Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

 _Conversion of Preferred Stock_. Each share of Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the sum of:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(i)

  |  

the Preferred Per Share Amount;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

an amount equal to the Per Share Common Closing Cash Consideration times the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Preferred Stock
would be converted pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

such amounts, if any, due in respect of such share of Preferred Stock in
accordance with _Section 1.05_ , _Section 1.10_ and _Section 9.05_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

1  

  

The aggregate consideration to which holders of Preferred Stock become
entitled pursuant to this _Section 1.02(b)_ is referred to herein as the "
_Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_."

  

    

(c)

  |  

 _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the sum of:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(i)

  |  

the Per Share Common Closing Cash Consideration; and

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

such amounts due, if any, in respect of such share of Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 1.05_ , _Section 1.10_ and _Section 9.05_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

The aggregate consideration to which holders of Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to this _Section 1.02(c)_ is referred to herein as the " _Common
Stock Merger Consideration_."

  

1.03 _Effect on Options and Warrants; MIP_.

  

    

(a)

  |  

 _Cash-Out Options_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(i)

  |  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of the Company or of any Securityholder, each Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is vested or that will become
vested upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (each, a " _Vested Option_
"), and each unvested Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that has not been designated by Parent as a Rollover Option in
accordance with _Section 1.03(b)_ (each Option covered by this _Section
1.03(a)_ including all Vested Options, a " _Cash-Out Option_ ") shall
automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer be outstanding and cease
to represent the right to acquire shares of Common Stock, and in consideration
therefor, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Option Consideration.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

The Closing Option Consideration payable to the holders of Cash-Out Options
shall be paid at or as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
and any remaining portion of the Option Consideration payable to the holders
of Cash-Out Options after the Closing shall be paid to the Surviving Company
for payment to holders of Cash-Out Options by the Surviving Company as
promptly as practicable following each such time as any such remaining portion
of the Option Consideration is received by the Surviving Company for payment
to such holders.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

 _Rollover Options_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(i)

  |  

At the Effective Time, each unvested Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and has been designated by Parent in its sole
discretion as a Rollover Option at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _Rollover Options_ ") shall be converted
into an unvested option (a " _Parent Option_ "), on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Rollover Option (including with
respect to vesting), to acquire a number of shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) of common stock of Parent, par value $0.001 per share ("
_Parent Common Stock_ "), determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to such Rollover Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the exercise
price per share of such Rollover Option divided by the Exchange Ratio.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company (or the
Compensation Committee of the Company, as applicable), shall take all actions
as may be reasonably necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law,
the Company Equity Plans or the award agreements applicable to such Options to
effectuate all of the actions contemplated by this _Section 1.03_ and provide
that the Company Equity Plans shall be terminated effective as of, and
contingent upon, the Closing.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

Each outstanding warrant to purchase Company Stock (the " _Warrants_ ") that
is then outstanding and unexercised shall be cancelled immediately prior to
the Effective Time, no longer be outstanding and cease to represent the right
to acquire shares of Company Stock, and in consideration therefor, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Warrant Consideration. The Company shall, prior to the Effective
Time, use its commercially reasonable efforts in order to effectuate the
actions contemplated by this _Section 1.03(d)_ ; _provided_ that such actions
shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and each of
the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall be of no force or effect
if this Agreement is terminated. The Closing Warrant Consideration shall be
paid to holders of Warrants by the Payments Administrator.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(e)

  |  

 _MIP_. At the Effective Time, each MIP Participant shall become entitled to
receive an amount equal to such participant\'s MIP Percentage times the MIP
Consideration, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the MIP at such times described in the following sentence. The MIP
Closing Consideration shall be paid at or as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time (but in no event prior to the Effective Date, as defined in
the MIP), and any remaining portion of the MIP Consideration payable to the
MIP Participants shall be paid to the Surviving Company for payment to the MIP
Participants by the Surviving Company as promptly as practicable following
each such time as any such remaining portion of the MIP Consideration is
received by the Surviving Company for payment to such participants.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

2  

  

1.04 _Exchange of Company Stock_.

  

    

(a)

  |  

Prior to the Closing Date, Acquiom Clearinghouse LLC or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, another financial institution
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent shall be appointed to act as
Payments Administrator for the Merger (the " _Payments Administrator_ ")
pursuant to a Payments Administrator agreement (the " _Payments Administrator
Agreement_ "), providing for, among other things, the matters set forth in
this _Section 1.04_. The fees and expenses of the Payments Administrator shall
be paid by Parent.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

After the Closing, promptly following surrender to the Payments Administrator
of a certificate representing share(s) of Company Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ "), or if any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof
(each, an " _Affidavit_ "), together with a duly completed and executed letter
of transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), the Payments Administrator will pay (or cause to
be paid), in accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_ , to the holder of such
Certificate or Affidavit the amount payable with respect to such share(s) of
Company Stock as provided in _Section 1.02_ , by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated in the applicable Letter of
Transmittal. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any shares of Company
Stock presented to the Surviving Company or Parent for any reason shall be
promptly forwarded to the Payments Administrator and converted into the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.02_ without
any interest thereon. None of Parent, the Surviving Company nor their
Affiliates shall be liable to any Securityholder for any amount paid to any
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar
laws. Any amount remaining in the Surviving Company\'s possession that is
unclaimed by Securityholders three (3) years after the Closing Date (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

   
---|--- 
  

  

  

1.05 _Representative Amount_. Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall
deduct from the Merger Consideration due to the Securityholders, an aggregate
amount equal to One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and such amount shall
be delivered by Parent to the Representative, on behalf of the
Securityholders, at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) designated by the Representative, to satisfy potential
future obligations of the Securityholders to the Representative, including
expenses of the Representative arising from the defense or enforcement of
claims pursuant to _Sections 1.09_ and _11.01_ (in the aggregate, the "
_Representative Amount_ "). The Representative Amount shall be retained in
whole or in part by the Representative for such time as the Representative
shall determine in its sole discretion. The Securityholders will not receive
any interest or earnings on the Representative Amount and irrevocably transfer
and assign to the Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Representative will not be
liable for any loss of principal of the Representative Amount other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative will
hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds
for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. If the Representative shall determine in its sole discretion to
return all or any portion of the Representative Amount to the Securityholders,
it shall deliver such amount to the Payments Administrator for further
distribution to each Securityholder of its pro rata portion thereof based on
its Pro Rata Percentage; _provided_ that to the extent a Securityholder is a
holder of Cash-Out Options or MIP Participant, the Representative shall
deposit with the Surviving Company any portion of such amount payable to such
holder of Cash-Out Options or MIP Participant, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company, as promptly as practicable following such deposit, to
distribute to each such holder or participant the amount specified in
instructions received from the Representative and, in such circumstances, the
amount distributed to the other Securityholders shall be reduced accordingly.
For tax purposes, the Representative Fund will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Securityholders at the time of
Closing.

  

1.06 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended and
restated in its entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ until
thereafter amended, in accordance with the provisions thereof and the DGCL. At
the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Company shall be amended and
restated to be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ , until thereafter
amended, in accordance with the provisions thereof, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company and the DGCL.

  

1.07 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected, appointed or otherwise designated in accordance
with applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Company, and the officers of Merger Sub at
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, each such
initial director and initial officer to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company as in effect
from and after the Effective Time.

  

1.08 _Closing Calculations_. Not less than five (5), but no more than seven
(7), Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a draft statement setting forth (a) an estimated
consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies as of the Reference Time,
(b) a good faith calculation of the Company\'s estimate of Funded Debt (the "
_Estimated Funded Debt_ "), Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital_ ") and Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "),
(c) the Closing Cash Consideration, the Preferred Stockholder Aggregate
Amount, the Common Closing Cash Consideration, the Per Share Common Closing
Cash Consideration, the aggregate Closing Option Consideration, the MIP
Closing Consideration, and the Rollover Option Amount and (d) a detailed funds
flow showing the amount of the Closing Cash Consideration each Securityholder
is to receive at the Closing. Parent may submit any objections in writing to
the Company until 5:00 p.m. New York time on the Business Day prior to the
anticipated Closing Date and the Company will cooperate in good faith with
Parent to revise the draft statement to reflect the mutual agreement of the
Company and Parent with respect to the estimated amounts set forth in the
preceding sentence (as so revised and agreed, the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "). After delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement, Parent and
its accountants and other representatives shall be permitted full access at
reasonable times to review the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' books and
records and any work papers (subject to Parent and its representatives
entering into any undertakings required by the Company\'s accountants in
connection therewith) related to the preparation of the Estimated Closing
Statement. Parent and its accountants and other representatives may make
reasonable inquiries of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
accountants and employees regarding questions concerning or disagreements with
the Estimated Closing Statement arising in the course of their review thereof,
and the Company shall use its, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their,
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants and employees to
cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. The Estimated Closing Statement
and the determinations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with
this Agreement.

1.09 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver to the Representative (a) a consolidated balance sheet of the Group
Companies as of the Reference Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and (b)
a statement showing the Funded Debt, Net Working Capital and Transaction
Expenses (the " _Closing Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared and Funded Debt, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses shall
be determined in accordance with this Agreement. The Parties agree that the
purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and determining Funded Debt,
Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses and the related purchase price
adjustment contemplated by this _Section 1.09_ is to measure the amount of
Funded Debt, changes in Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses. After
delivery of the Closing Statement, the Representative and its accountants and
other representatives shall be permitted full access at reasonable times to
review the Surviving Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' books and records and
any work papers (subject to the Representative and its representatives
entering into any undertakings required by Parent\'s accountants in connection
therewith) related to the preparation of the Closing Statement. The
Representative and its accountants and other representatives may make
reasonable inquiries of Parent, the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective accountants and employees regarding questions concerning or
disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of their review
thereof, and Parent shall use its, and shall cause the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
such accountants and employees to cooperate with and respond to such
inquiries. If the Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement,
the Representative shall deliver to Parent a written statement (an "
_Objections Statement_ ") stating such objections and specifying in reasonable
detail each item that the Representative disputes (each, a " _Disputed Item_
") and the amount in dispute for each Disputed Item and the reasons supporting
the Representative\'s positions. If an Objections Statement is not delivered
to Parent within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the
Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the Parties. The Representative and Parent shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any Disputed Items, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, the Representative and Parent shall submit such dispute to the
Chicago office of Ernst and Young, or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to
serve in such capacity, another nationally recognized independent accounting
firm reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Representative (the " _Dispute
Resolution Arbiter_ "). Any further submissions to the Dispute Resolution
Arbiter must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The
Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall consider only those items and amounts that
are identified in the Objections Statement as Disputed Items. The Dispute
Resolution Arbiter\'s determination shall be based solely on the definitions
of Funded Debt, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses contained herein
and the provisions of this Agreement, including this _Section 1.09_ and
_Exhibit F_. The Representative and Parent shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Arbiter to resolve all
disagreements as soon as practicable in amounts equal to or between the
disputed amounts set forth in the Closing Statement and the Objections
Statement. Further, the Dispute Resolution Arbiter\'s determination shall be
based solely on the presentations by Parent and the Representative that are in
accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._
, not on the basis of an independent review). The resolution of the dispute by
the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be final and binding on and
non‑appealable by the Parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the Dispute
Resolution Arbiter shall be allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and the
Representative (solely on behalf of the Securityholders), on the other hand,
based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded
to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For
example, if the Representative claims Net Working Capital is One Thousand
Dollars ($1,000) greater than the amount determined by Parent, and Parent
contests only Five Hundred Dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the
Representative, and if the Dispute Resolution Arbiter ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding the Representative (for the benefit of the
Securityholders) Three Hundred Dollars ($300) of the Five Hundred Dollars
($500) contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration shall be
allocated sixty percent (60%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to Parent and forty
percent (40%) ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to the Representative (solely on behalf of
the Securityholders).

  

1.10 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

  

(a) If the Final Cash Consideration is greater than the Closing Cash
Consideration, (i) Parent shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days following the final determination of the Final Cash
Consideration) pay to the Payments Administrator an amount equal to such
difference (the " _Excess Amount_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by the Payments Administrator for
the benefit of the Securityholders and the Payments Administrator shall
distribute to each Securityholder its pro rata portion thereof based on its
Pro Rata Percentage; _provided_ that, with respect to any holder of a Cash-Out
Option or MIP Participant, Parent shall pay to the Surviving Company (for
distribution to such holder of the Cash-Out Options or MIP Participant) such
holder\'s or participant\'s pro rata portion of the Excess Amount, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
the Surviving Company, in lieu of including such amount in its payment to the
Payments Administrator pursuant to clause (i) above; and (ii) the
Representative and Parent shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Payments Administrator
the funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account for the benefit of
the Securityholders, and the Payments Administrator shall distribute to each
Securityholder its pro rata portion thereof based on its Pro Rata Percentage.
In no event shall the amount paid by Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.10(a)_
be greater than an amount equal to the sum of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount and the amount, if any, remaining in the Indemnification Escrow
Account as of the date of any payment pursuant to this _Section 1.10_.

  

(b) If the Final Cash Consideration is less than the Closing Cash
Consideration, Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days) deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent
the absolute value of such difference (the " _Shortfall Amount_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one (1) or more accounts designated
by Parent to the Representative. The instructions to the Escrow Agent shall
provide that the Shortfall Amount shall be paid (i) first, from the funds
available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and (ii) second, if
the Shortfall Amount exceeds the funds available in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account, from the funds available in the Indemnification
Escrow Account. In the event that the funds available in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account are in excess of the Shortfall Amount (such excess,
the " _Escrow Excess Amount_ "), the Representative and Parent shall
simultaneously with the delivery of the instructions described in the first
sentence of this _Section 1.10(b)_ , deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Payments Administrator the Escrow Excess Amount for
the benefit of the Securityholders, and the Payments Administrator shall
distribute to each Securityholder its pro rata portion thereof based on its
Pro Rata Percentage; _provided_ that, with respect to any holder of a Cash-Out
Option or MIP Participant, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Surviving Company
(for distribution to such holder of the Cash-Out Options or MIP Participant)
such holder\'s or participant\'s pro rata portion of the Escrow Excess Amount,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Surviving Company, in lieu of including such amount in its
payment to the Payments Administrator. Absent fraud or willful misconduct, the
Securityholders shall not have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to
_Section 1.09_ or this _Section 1.10_ except to the extent of the funds
available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and the
Indemnification Escrow Account.

  

(c) If the Final Cash Consideration is equal to the Closing Cash
Consideration, the Representative and Parent shall promptly (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days), deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Payments Administrator the entire Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount for the benefit of the Securityholders, and the
Payments Administrator shall distribute to each Securityholder its pro rata
portion thereof based on its Pro Rata Percentage; _provided_ that, with
respect to any holder of a Cash-Out Option or MIP Participant, the Escrow
Agent shall pay to the Surviving Company (for distribution to such holder of
the Cash-Out Options or MIP Participant) such holder\'s or participant\'s pro
rata portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Surviving Company, in lieu of including such amount in its payment to the
Payments Administrator.

 _Escrow Accounts_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall deduct from the Merger
Consideration due to the Securityholders and deposit Two Million One Hundred
Thirty Thousand Dollars ($2,130,000) (such amount, the " _Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") in immediately available funds into an escrow
account (which may be a sub-account, the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account_ ") to be established and maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of
_Exhibit E_ attached hereto, with such changes as may be required by the
Escrow Agent and reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Representative, to be
entered into on the Closing Date by Parent, the Representative and the Escrow
Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). Absent fraud or willful misconduct, the
amounts contained in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account shall serve
as a security for, and, together with the Indemnification Escrow Account, the
sole and exclusive source of payment of, Parent\'s rights pursuant to _Section
1.10_ , if any.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall further deduct from the
Merger Consideration due to the Securityholders and deposit Fourteen Million
Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($14,200,000) (such amount, the "
_Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") in immediately available funds into a
second escrow account (which may be a sub-account, the " _Indemnification
Escrow Account_ ") to be established and maintained by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Absent fraud or
willful misconduct, the amounts contained in the Indemnification Escrow
Account shall serve as a security for, and, (i) together with the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Account, the sole and exclusive source of payment of,
Parent\'s rights pursuant to _Section 1.10_ , if any, and (ii) the sole and
exclusive source of payment of Parent\'s rights pursuant to _Section 7.03_ or
_Article IX_ , if any.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

All fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall be paid by Parent.

   
---|--- 
  

  

1.12 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL, any share
of Company Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Common Stockholder or Preferred
Stockholder who did not consent to or vote (by a valid and enforceable proxy
or otherwise) in favor of the approval of this Agreement, which Common
Stockholder or Preferred Stockholder complies with all of the provisions of
the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters\' rights (such
share being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such Common Stockholder or Preferred
Stockholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the consideration to which the holder of such share would
be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.02_ but rather shall be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such stockholder\'s dissenters\'
rights under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights
with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
automatically be converted into the right to receive, without any interest
thereon, the consideration referred to in _Section 1.02_ , pursuant to the
exchange procedures set forth in _Section 1.04(b)_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of a stockholder to be paid the fair value of such
holder\'s Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease.
The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demand for payment of
the fair value of any shares of Company Stock or any attempted withdrawal of
any such demand for payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to any stockholder\'s dissenters\'
rights and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands for payment under the DGCL. The
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for
appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares without the prior written
consent of Parent.

  

1.13 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, each of the Payments Administrator, the Escrow Agent, the Surviving
Company, the Representative and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax Law. If the Payments
Administrator, Escrow Agent, the Surviving Company, the Representative or
Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

1.14 _Reference Statement_. _Exhibit F_ sets forth an illustrative statement
prepared in good faith by the Company in cooperation with Parent setting forth
the various line items used (or to be used) in, and illustrating as of the
date set forth therein, the calculation of Funded Debt, Net Working Capital
and Transaction Expenses prepared and calculated in accordance with this
Agreement.

  

1.15 _Parent\'s Obligations_. So long as Parent shall have deposited with the
Payments Administrator, the Representative, the Escrow Agent, the Company and
the Surviving Company, as applicable, the amounts set forth in _Sections
2.02(b)_ \- _(g)_ and _Section 1.10_ (if any such payment is due), the Parties
understand and agree that neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Surviving Company
shall have any liability to any Person for any errors or omissions in the
allocation or disbursement of such portion of the Merger Consideration by the
Company (prior to the Effective Time), the Surviving Company (to the extent
such allocation or disbursement is made in accordance with directions from the
Representative), the Payments Administrator, the Escrow Agent or the
Representative.

The Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows, except as set forth

The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and all

properties and assets as they are now being owned, leased and operated and to
carry on its businesses as now conducted. The Company is qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing (where such concept
is recognized) in every jurisdiction in which it is required to qualify, which
jurisdictions are set forth on _Schedule 3.01_ , except where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered to Parent complete copies of the Organizational
Documents as currently in effect, and the Company is not in violation of any
provision of such Organizational Documents.

  

3.02 _Subsidiaries_. _Schedule 3.02_ accurately sets forth each Subsidiary of

owned directly or indirectly by the Company, the record ownership as of the

standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization. Each Subsidiary has all requisite corporate, or other legal
entity, as the case may be, power and authority and all authorizations,
licenses and permits necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets as they are now being owned, leased and operated and to carry on its
businesses as now conducted. Each Subsidiary is qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized)
in every jurisdiction in which it is required to qualify, except in each such
case where the failure to hold such authorizations, licenses and permits or to
be so qualified would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to
Parent complete copies of the organizational documents of each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries as currently in effect, and none of the Subsidiaries
is in violation of any provision of such organizational documents.

  

3.03 _Authorization; No Breach; Valid and Binding Agreement_.

documents) of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) require any consent of or
other action by any Person or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under,
constitute a default or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time

to Section 409A of the Code (a " _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ")

3.15 _Insurance_. _Schedule 3.15_ lists each insurance policy maintained by
the Group Companies as of the date hereof. The Company has provided to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of all such policies. All of the insurance
policies of the Group Companies are in full force and effect, no notice of
cancellation or non-renewal of such policies has been received, and there is
no existing breach, default or event which, with or without notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute a material breach or default or permit
termination or modification of any such policies. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and since January 1, 2012 has been, insured by financially
sound and reputable insurers, unaffiliated with the Company or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, with respect to the Assets and the conduct of each

the Assets and the conduct of their respective businesses in accordance with
customary industry practice. The Company or a Subsidiary is a "named insured"
or an "insured" under each such insurance policy. None of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have been refused any insurance, nor has any of their
coverage been limited, by any insurance carrier to which any of them have

or any Subsidiary pending under any of such policies as to which coverage has
been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or in
respect of which such underwriters have reserved their rights. All premiums
payable under such policies have been timely paid, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have otherwise materially complied with the terms and conditions
of such policies. To the knowledge of the Company, since the time any such
policies were last renewed or issued, there has not been any threatened
termination of, premium increase with respect to or alteration of coverage
under any of such policies.

make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not a waiver, of the closing
conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_ ); _provided_ that such efforts shall
not require agreeing to any obligations or accommodations (financial or
otherwise) that would be binding on a Group Company in the event the Closing
does not occur. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in
this _Section 5.03_ shall limit, expand or otherwise modify in any way any
efforts standard explicitly applicable to any of the Company\'s obligations
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the
lessor or licensor under any lease of real property conditions its grant of a
consent (including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other

consent request regarding this Agreement, the payment of a consent fee,
"profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased rent
payments), or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty),
Parent shall be solely responsible for making all such payments or providing
all such additional security and such payments shall not constitute
Transaction Expenses; provided, that the Company shall not agree to such
payments or additional security without Parent\'s prior written consent.

any information to, or enter into any agreement with, any Person (other than
Parent and Parent\'s Representatives) concerning (i) any liquidation,
dissolution or recapitalization, (ii) any purchase of the outstanding or
unissued Company Stock or (iii) any merger, sale of all or a significant
portion of the assets of the Group Companies or similar transactions involving
the Group Companies (each such transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ ");
_provided_ that this _Section 5.04_ shall not apply to the Company in
connection with Securityholder communications related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its
officers, directors, employees, agents, partners, Affiliates and other
representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions,
communications or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and Merger
Sub and their representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any

Company shall instruct each Person (other than Parent and Merger Sub and their
representatives, the Representative and any Securityholder) in possession of
confidential information about the Company that was furnished pursuant to a

occurrence of each of the matters contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i)

of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date of this Agreement
the Company has knowledge of any fact or condition that constitutes a breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Company in _Article III_ or of
any covenant, the Company shall promptly disclose such breach in writing to
Parent. No information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.07_ shall be
deemed to cure any breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made in
this Agreement.

  

5.08 _Section 280G Approval_. The Company shall seek approval by the
stockholders, in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of the
right of any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c)
of the Code and the regulations thereunder) to receive or retain any payments
that would, in the absence of such stockholder approval, constitute "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Prior to
seeking such approval, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to obtain
from each disqualified individual waivers that provide that no payments and/or
benefits that would separately or in the aggregate constitute "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code ("
_Parachute Payments_ ") with respect to such disqualified individual shall, in
the absence of such stockholder approval referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence, be payable to or retained by such disqualified individual
to the extent such Parachute Payments would not be deductible by reason of the
application of Section 280G of the Code or would result in the imposition of
the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code on such disqualified individual.
All materials produced by the Company in connection with the implementation of
this Section 5.08 shall be provided to Parent at least three (3) Business Days
in advance for Parent\'s reasonable review and comment, and the Company shall
consider any of Parent\'s reasonable requested changes or comments in good

complies with applicable Law and is in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent.

continue to carry their existing insurance through the Closing, and shall not
allow any material breach, default or any cancellation (other than expiration
and replacement of policies in the ordinary cause of business consistent with
past practice) of such insurance policies or agreements to occur or exist
without the prior written consent of Parent.

ARTICLE VII 
  
  
  _EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND TAX MATTERS_

  

7.01 _Compensation and Employee Benefits_. Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to provide, employees who continue to be employed
by the Surviving Company (collectively, " _Continuing Employees_ ") (i) during
the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, (x) with at least the same salary or hourly
wage rate as provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (y) with employee benefits that are substantially similar in
the aggregate to the employee benefits provided by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) for the remainder of the Company\'s fiscal
year in effect as of the Closing Date, with ordinary course annual bonus
opportunities established at and effective as of the beginning of the
Company\'s fiscal year that are at least the same as those provided to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent further
agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Company to, grant all Continuing Employees credit for any
service with the Company earned prior to the Closing Date for eligibility,
vesting, and benefit accrual purposes (excluding benefit accruals under any
defined benefit plan or as otherwise prohibited by Law) under any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement in which the Continuing
Employees commence to participate on or after the Closing Date (collectively,
the " _New Plans_ "), except (1) for New Plans as to which employees of Parent
who are similarly situated to the Continuing Employees are not provided such
service credit or (2) as would result in duplication of benefits. In addition,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause to be waived all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a
Continuing Employee under any Company Employee Benefit Plan or under any other
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement as of the date
on which commencement of participation in such New Plan begins, and (y) cause
any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid during
the calendar year in which commencement of participation in such New Plan
begins and prior to such commencement of participation by any Continuing
Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes
of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of
pocket provisions under such New Plan in the year of initial participation.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing,
any Group Company) shall be responsible for any Controlled Group Liability,
and Parent and its applicable Subsidiaries shall be entitled to
indemnification from the Indemnification Escrow Account for any Controlled
Group Liability incurred by Parent and its Subsidiaries.

  

7.02 _No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Amendments; No Guarantees of
Employment_. Nothing contained in this _Article VII_ , express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any employee any right to continued employment for any
period or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall
constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any New Plan or
Company Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement. Further, this Article VII shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in _Section 7.01_ or this _Section 7.02_ , express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other Person, including any Continuing Employee,
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 7.02_.

  

7.03 _Tax Matters_.

  

    

(a)

  |  

 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(i)

  |  

The Company shall timely prepare and file (or shall cause to be timely
prepared and filed) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period
that are due (taking into account extensions validly obtained) on or before
the Closing Date and the Company shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such
Tax Returns. The Company shall (i) prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax
Returns consistent with this Agreement and past practice and (ii) provide
copies of any income or other material Tax Returns to Parent at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of any such Tax
Returns.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Except for any Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed (or caused to be
prepared and filed) pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)(i)_ , Parent shall timely
prepare and file (or shall cause to be timely prepared and filed) all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period that are due (taking into account
valid extensions) after the Closing Date and for any Straddle Period, the
reasonable third-party costs and expenses of which shall be borne by the
Securityholders (and paid from the Indemnification Escrow Account). Parent
shall (i) prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax Returns consistent with
this Agreement and, in the case of such Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing
Period, past practice and (ii) provide copies of any income or other material
Tax Returns to the Representative for its review and comment at least forty-
five (45) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of any such Tax
Returns. In the event that the Representative reasonably objects to any item
or items in such proposed Tax Returns at least twenty-five (25) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return, Parent shall revise
such Tax Returns to reflect the comments of the Representative to the extent
Parent agrees with such comments. In the event that the Representative and
Parent are unable to resolve such comments at least ten (10) days prior to the
due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return, such dispute shall be
resolved by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter prior to the due date (including
extensions) of such Tax Return. Parent shall timely remit (or cause to be
timely remitted) to the relevant Governmental Entity any Taxes due with
respect to Tax Returns described in this _Section 7.03(a)(ii)_ ; _provided_
that Parent shall be entitled to indemnification for any amount for which the
Securityholders are responsible with respect to such Tax Return pursuant to
_Section 7.03(b)_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

 _Tax Indemnification_. From and after the Closing, Parent, the Surviving
Company, their respective Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, agents, representatives, successors and assigns of each such
Person (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled
to indemnification solely from the Indemnification Escrow Account for, without
duplication, all (A) Excluded Taxes, (B) any Taxes arising out of,
attributable to, relating to or resulting from the failure of any of the
representations or warranties made by the Company or the Representative in
this Agreement to be true and correct on the date hereof and at and as of the
Closing Date (except those representations and warranties that address matters
only as of a particular date, which need only be true and correct as of such
date) or the failure of the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section
2.02(i)(iv)_ to be true and correct at and as of the Closing Date; (C) any
Taxes arising out of, attributable to, relating to or resulting from any
breach by the Company or any Subsidiary of any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein which are to be performed by the Company on or before the
Closing Date, and any breach by the Representative of any of its covenants or
agreements contained herein; and (D) reasonable third-party costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any
item in clauses (A)-(C) of this _Section 7.03(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any such Taxes to the extent a liability for such Taxes was specifically
identified and reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event a proposed assessment
by the Internal Revenue Service or other Taxing authority results in an upward
adjustment to the Company\'s Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (except to the
extent that such upward adjustment results in a downward adjustment in any
other taxable period) for which the Parent Indemnified Parties would be
entitled to indemnification hereunder, but such Taxes are reduced by the
utilization of the Company\'s net operating losses, then the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification in the amount to
which they would have been entitled in the absence of such reduction.

 _Straddle Period Allocations_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Straddle Period, (i)
Property Taxes of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries allocable to the
Pre-Closing Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and
(ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as if such
taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date; _provided_ that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period ending after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period. _Pre-Closing Tax
Matters_. Except as otherwise required by Law, Parent shall not and shall
cause the Group Companies not to amend any previously filed Tax Return of any
Group Company for any Pre-Closing Period, make any Tax election that has any
effect in a Pre-Closing Period or enter into any voluntary disclosure or
compliance procedures or make other similar voluntary contacts with any
Governmental Entity for any Pre-Closing Period if such amendment, election or
voluntary disclosure, compliance procedure or voluntary contact would result
in a Tax for which the Securityholders are liable pursuant to Section 7.03(b)
without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(e)

  |  

 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) on or before
the Closing Date all Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity or similar agreement
or arrangement (other than agreements with customary terms entered into in the
ordinary course of business the principal purpose of which does not relate to
Tax or this Agreement), if any, to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any person (other than the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, are parties to, and neither Parent,

(i)

  |  

If any Governmental Entity asserts a Tax Claim, then the party first receiving
notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide written notice thereof to the
other party or parties hereto; provided, however, that the failure to so
notify shall not relieve the party from whom indemnification is being sought
of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the party from whom
indemnification is being sought is materially prejudiced by such failure. Such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and
shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received
from the Governmental Entity.

respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries described in _Section
7.03(f)(ii)_ if the Representative fails to defend diligently such Tax

9.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Agreements and Other
Provisions_. The representations and warranties of the Company, the
Representative, Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.02(g)_ or _2.02(i)_ shall survive
the Closing until the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing (the "
_Survival Termination Date_ ").

  

9.02 _Indemnification_.

  

    

(a)

  |  

Subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_ , after the Closing Date, the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification solely from
the Indemnification Escrow Account for any and all Losses incurred or suffered
by any of them, directly or indirectly, as a result of, relating to or arising
out of:

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(i)

  |  

the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the Company in
this Agreement to be true and correct on the date hereof and at and as of the
Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case only as of such date) or the failure of the certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.02(i)(ii)_ or _2.02(i)(iv)_ to be true and correct at
and as of the Closing Date;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the
Representative in _Section 11.01(g)_ of this Agreement to be true and correct
on the date hereof and at and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case only as of such date);

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

any breach by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of any of its
covenants or agreements contained herein which are to be performed by the
Company or such Subsidiary on or before the Closing Date;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(iv)

  |  

any breach by the Representative of any of its covenants or agreements
contained herein which are to be performed by the Representative;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(v)

  |  

any Excess Dissenting Share Payments;

   
---|---

(viii)

  |  

the Specified Amount to the extent it becomes due and payable pursuant to
_Section 5.12_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 _provided_ that the aggregate amount of Losses with respect to which all
Parent Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 9.02(a)_ shall not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount. For the
avoidance of doubt, payment of the MIP Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.03(e)_ shall not be deemed a Loss pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)(vi)_.

  

    

(b)

  |  

The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_
and _Section 9.02(a)_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby until the Survival Termination Date; except for claims for
indemnification pursuant to such clauses asserted prior to the Survival
Termination Date, in accordance with _Section 7.03_ or _Section 9.03_ , which
claims shall survive until final resolution thereof.

   
---|--- 
  

  

9.03 _Claims_.

  

    

(a)

  |  

Any party seeking indemnification under _Section 9.02_ (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall promptly give the party from whom indemnification is being
sought (such notified party, the " _Responsible Party_ ") notice (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") of any matter which such Indemnified Party has determined has given
or could give rise to a right of indemnification under _Section 9.02_ , within
twenty (20) days of such determination, stating the nature of the claim, to
the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, a good-faith estimate of the
Loss and method of computation thereof, to the extent then reasonably
estimable, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in
respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises (it being
agreed that the failure to specify any provision of this Agreement in such
Claim Notice shall not preclude the Indemnified Party from asserting that
there has been a breach of, or inaccuracy in, or failure to perform such
provision); _provided_ that the failure to so timely notify shall not relieve
the Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
the Responsible Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. With respect
to any recovery or indemnification sought by an Indemnified Party from the
Responsible Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, if the
Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within twenty (20)
days from its receipt of the Claim Notice that the Responsible Party disputes
such claim (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), the Responsible Party shall be deemed
to have accepted and agreed with such claim. If the Responsible Party has
disputed a claim for indemnification under _Section 9.02_ (including any Third
Party Claim), the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute. If the Responsible Party
and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such dispute in thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant
to the terms of _Sections 13.11_ , _13.15_ and _13.16_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

27  

  

    

(b)

  |  

If an Action by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made against any
Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity
with respect thereto under _Section 9.02_ , such Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Responsible Party of such claims; _provided_ that the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party is
materially prejudiced thereby. Other than in connection with a Third Party
Claim by a Governmental Entity, the Responsible Party shall have the right to
assume, within twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice, the conduct and
control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the
expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, by
sending notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, which notice shall state that
Responsible Party shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for the entirety of
all Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided_
that the Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate
in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be borne by such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding an election to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate co-counsel and to participate in the defense as
counsel of record, if applicable, in such action or proceeding (and the
parties shall jointly control the defense), and the Responsible Party shall
bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i)
there exists any actual or potential conflict of interest between the
Indemnified Party and the Responsible Party in connection with the defense of
the Third Party Claim that would make representation by the same counsel or
the counsel selected by the Responsible Party inappropriate, (ii) such Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party (iii) such Third Party Claim is related to or otherwise
arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory enforcement Action, (iv)
the amount at issue in the Third Party Claim exceeds the funds remaining in
the Indemnification Escrow Account or (v) the resolution of the Third Party
Claim could materially affect the operations or business of Parent, the
Company or their Subsidiaries.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably contesting any such Third Party
Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any Third
Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that in such
event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Responsible Party
or from the Indemnification Escrow Account, as the case may be, for such Third
Party Claim unless the Responsible Party shall have consented to such payment
or settlement. If the Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party\'s notice
of a Third Party Claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the
defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle
or compromise the Third Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
neither the settlement nor the amount paid in any settlement of any such Third
Party Claim entered into without the consent of the Responsible Party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall be
determinative of the existence of or amount of Losses, if any, for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification with respect to such Third
Party Claim. The Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement that (i) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such
Third Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from
all Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of
any judgment, (ii) does not involve only the payment of money damages, (iii)
imposes an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party,
(iv) includes any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the Indemnified
Party or (v) involves the payment of money damages in excess of the funds
remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

Any Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Responsible Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of
any Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall furnish such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal
business hours afforded to the Responsible Party and its agents and
representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of,
records and information which have been identified by the Responsible Party as
being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The parties shall cooperate
with each other in any notifications to insurers.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(e)

  |  

With respect to procedural matters only, such as notices, communications and
other actions required under this _Article IX_ involving the Securityholders
as the "Responsible Party", the Representative shall administer, manage,
control or conduct such procedural matters pursuant to the authority granted
to the Representative under _Article XI_ and references to the "Responsible
Party" shall be deemed to refer to the Representative for such purposes (and
not with respect to liability for Losses) under this _Article IX_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

9.04 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the Parent
Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section
9.02_ are subject to the following limitations:

  

    

(a)

  |  

The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover Losses
pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ or the last sentence of _Section 7.03(b)_
until the total amount which the Parent Indemnified Parties would recover
under _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ and the last sentence of _Section 7.03(b)_ , but
for this _Section 9.04(a)_ , exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "
_Tipping Amount_ "), whereupon the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to indemnification for all such Losses from the first dollar;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Tipping Amount shall not apply to Losses in
respect of claims for breach of representations and warranties related to
Company Fundamental Representations and any amounts recovered for Losses by
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to breaches of Company Fundamental
Representations shall not apply against the Tipping Amount.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Individual Losses of less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) shall not be
recoverable by any Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing in this
_Section 9.04_ shall limit any Person\'s rights to recovery in respect of
fraud or willful misconduct.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(d)

  |  

For the purposes of this _Article IX_ and _Section 7.03(b)_ only, solely when
determining the amount of Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party as a result
of any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement, the amount of such Losses shall be determined (but not the
determination of the inaccuracy or breach) without reference to the terms
"knowledge of the Company," "knowledge of the Parent," "material," "Material
Adverse Effect" and other similar qualifications as to materiality contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representations and warranties.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(e)

  |  

In calculating amounts of Losses payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder,
the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be determined net of amounts
actually recovered under any insurance policy (less costs incurred to obtain
such recoveries) with respect to such Losses.

   
---|--- 
  

  

 

28  

  

9.05 _Indemnification Escrow_.

  

    

(a)

  |  

To the extent that any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to any
indemnification payments, such indemnification payments shall be disbursed to
such Parent Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from the Indemnification Escrow Account.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

In accordance with the Escrow Agreement, unless any such balance is then
subject to a pending claim or dispute, (i) on the twelve (12)-month
anniversary of the Closing Date the parties shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of (x) the balance of the cash held in the Indemnification Escrow
Account, minus (y) the amount of any then-pending but unresolved claims; and
(ii) on the Survival Termination Date, the parties shall provide a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of (x) the balance of the cash held in the
Indemnification Escrow Account, minus (y) the amount of any then-pending but
unresolved claims. Such joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent shall
cause the Escrow Agent to pay the amounts set forth above to the Payments
Administrator for the benefit of the Securityholders. The Payments
Administrator shall distribute to each Securityholder its pro rata portion
thereof based on its Pro Rata Percentage; _provided_ that to the extent a
Securityholder is a holder of Cash-Out Options or a MIP Participant, the
Payments Administrator shall deposit with the Surviving Company any portion of
such amount payable to such holder of Cash-Out Options or MIP Participant, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company, as promptly practicable following
such deposit, to distribute to each such holder or participant such amounts,
and the amount distributed to the other Securityholders shall be reduced
accordingly. Upon final resolution of any unresolved claim in respect of which
an amount (that otherwise would have been released pursuant to the first
sentence of this _Section 9.05(b))_ had been retained (to the extent not
utilized to satisfy valid claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.02(a)_ ), the parties shall provide a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to deliver such amount promptly from the Indemnification Escrow
Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds and shall be paid to
each Securityholder in accordance with the process set forth in the preceding
sentence and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

Promptly upon any Person becoming entitled to release of amounts from the
Indemnification Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_ or this _Article
IX_ or the Escrow Agreement, the parties shall execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to so release
such amounts.

9.06 _Maximum Cumulative Liability of Securityholders; Exclusive Remedy_.

  

    

(a)

  |

cumulative liability of the Securityholders to the Parent Indemnified Parties,
for indemnification or otherwise, arising out of, based on or related to this
Agreement (including without limitation _Sections 1.09_ , _1.10_ and _7.03_
and this _Article IX_ ) and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not exceed the funds available in the Indemnification Escrow Account
and, with respect to _Sections 1.09_ and _1.10_ , the funds available in the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 9.06(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the liability
of a particular Securityholder in the case of fraud or willful misconduct
committed by that Securityholder.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(b)

  |  

From and after the Closing, the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties to
indemnification relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be strictly limited to recovery from the funds available in the
Indemnification Escrow Account and, with respect to _Sections 1.09_ and _1.10_
, the funds available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, and
such indemnification rights pursuant to Sections _1.09_ , _1.10_ , _7.03_ and
this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent
Indemnified Parties against the Securityholders with respect to any matter in
any way relating to, based on, arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including without
limitation any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, except with respect to (a) claims for injunctive relief or specific
performance, or (b) claims against a particular Securityholder for fraud or

10.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

  

    

(a)

  |  

by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b)

  |  

by Parent if the Written Consent shall not have been obtained and delivered to
Parent within twenty-four (24) hours of the execution of this Agreement;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

by Parent, if any of the representations or warranties of the Company or the
Representative set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct, or
if the Company has failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of
the Company set forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate
the Closing), in each case, such that the conditions to the Closing set forth
in either _Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_ would not be satisfied as of
the Closing Date and the breach or breaches causing such representations or
warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to perform any covenant
or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within twenty (20) Business Days
after written notice thereof is delivered to the Company; _provided_ that
Parent and Merger Sub are not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause
the condition to the Closing set forth in either _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section
8.02(b)_ to not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

   
---|---

part of Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, set forth in this Agreement
(including an obligation to consummate the Closing), in each case, such that

or breaches causing such representations or warranties not to be true and
correct, or the failures to perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable,
are not cured within twenty (20) Business Days after written notice thereof is
delivered to Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_ that the Company and the
Representative are not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause the
condition to the Closing set forth in _Section 8.01(a)_ or _Section 8.01(b)_
from being satisfied as of the Closing Date;

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(e)

  |  

by Parent or the Company, if Closing shall not have been consummated on or
prior to December 31, 2015 (such date, the " _Outside Date_ ") and the Party

not have ( _provided_ that, if such Party is Parent, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall have) breached in any material respect its obligations under this
Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately caused the failure to
consummate the Closing on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ that if any
Party brings any Action pursuant to _Section 13.18_ to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended pursuant to _Section 13.18(b)_ ;
and

(f)

  |  

by either the Company or Parent, if (i) there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the Merger illegal or (ii) any Governmental Entity having
competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, and
such Order or other action shall have become final and nonappealable.

   
---|--- 
  

  

10.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company as provided above, the provisions of this
Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further force and effect
(other than the second to last sentence of _Section 5.02_ , this _Section
10.02_ , and _Article XII_ and _Article XIII_ hereof which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement (other than the provisions of _Section 13.18_ ,
which shall terminate)), and there shall be no liability on the part of either
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Representative or the Securityholders to
one another, except for fraud or Willful Breaches of this Agreement prior to
the time of such termination. No termination of this Agreement shall affect
the obligations contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms.

the requisite holders of Company Stock of this Agreement, all of the
Securityholders collectively and irrevocably constitute and appoint the
Representative, as their agent and representative to act from and after the
date hereof and to do any and all things and execute any and all documents
which the Representative determines may be necessary, convenient or
appropriate to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by

agreements contemplated hereby, any claim made by Parent or Merger Sub under
this Agreement or other agreements contemplated hereby, (B) negotiating and

(b)

  |  

 _Authorization_. The appointment of the Representative is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable by any Securityholder in any manner or for
any reason. This authority granted to the Representative shall not be affected
by the death, illness, dissolution, disability, incapacity or other inability
to act of any principal pursuant to any applicable Law. Shareholder
Representative Services LLC hereby accepts its appointment as the initial
Representative.

   
---|--- 
  

  

    

(c)

  |  

 _Limitations on Authorization_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document related to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement ("Related Documents"), the
Representative shall only have the power or authority to act regarding matters
pertaining to the Securityholders as a group and not individually, and shall
not have any power or authority to do or cause to be done any action
(including without limitation by amending, modifying or waiving any provision
of this Agreement or a Related Document or otherwise) that (i) results in a
change to any Securityholder\'s indemnity or other obligations or liabilities
as set forth in this Agreement or any Related Document (including without
limitation imposing joint or joint and several liability on any
Securityholder), (ii) results in the amounts payable under this Agreement or a
Related Document to any Securityholder being distributed in any manner other
than as specified pursuant to this Agreement or a Related Document, (iii)
changes the form or amount of the Merger Consideration, or (iv) binds any
Securityholder to any obligations or restrictions applicable to such
Securityholder beyond the subject matter of an indemnifiable claim (for
example and without limitation, the Representative has no authority to agree
to a general release of all claims a Securityholder may have against any
Person when settling or compromising a specific indemnifiable claim, or to
agree to any non-solicitation or non-competition covenant that would bind any
Securityholder). For the avoidance of doubt, the Representative consenting to
all or a portion of an indemnification claim, or entering into a settlement
agreement with respect thereto, in accordance with the procedures, limitations
of liability and Representative authority set forth in this Agreement (as of
the execution date of this Agreement and as amended in compliance with
_Section 13.08_ below) shall not be deemed to implicate clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii) of the previous sentence or require the prior written approval of any
Securityholder pursuant to the previous sentence. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Agreement or any Related Document permits the Representative
to exercise a Securityholder\'s voting rights under _Section 11.01(b)_ of this
Agreement, or a Securityholder\'s actual voting rights with respect to the
Securityholder\'s shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with
any meetings of the Company\'s stockholders or actions by written consent in
lieu of a stockholders\' meeting prior to the Effective Time.

 _Actions by the Representative; Resignation; Vacancies_. The Representative
may resign from its position as Representative at any time by written notice
delivered to Parent and the Securityholders. If there is a vacancy at any time
in the position of the Representative for any reason, such vacancy shall be
filled by the majority vote in accordance with the method set forth in
_Section 11.01(b)_.

(e)

  |  

 _No Liability_. All acts of the Representative hereunder shall be deemed to
be acts in its capacity as the Representative and not acts of the
Representative individually. Other than as a result of fraud or willful
misconduct by the Representative, the Representative shall not have any
liability for any amount owed to Parent pursuant to this Agreement, including

 _Indemnification; Expenses_. The Representative may use the Representative
Amount to pay any fees, costs, expenses or other obligations incurred by the
Representative acting in its capacity as such. Without limiting the foregoing
sentence, each Securityholder shall, severally and not jointly and only to the
extent of such Securityholder\'s Pro Rata Percentage thereof, indemnify and
defend the Representative and hold the Representative harmless against any and
all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the
Representative\'s duties under this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;
provided, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Representative, the Representative will reimburse the
Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the
extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Representative by the Securityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Representative from (i) the
Representative Amount, and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Securityholders;
provided, that while this section allows the Representative to be paid from
the Representative Amount and the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the
Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Securityholders or otherwise. Any expenses incurred by the
Representative in connection with the performance of its duties under this
Agreement shall not be the personal obligation of the Representative but shall
be payable by and attributable to the Securityholders based on each such
Person\'s Pro Rata Percentage. The Representative may also from time to time
submit invoices to the Securityholders covering such Representative Losses,
which shall be paid by the Securityholders promptly following the receipt
thereof on a pro rata basis based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages.
Upon the request of any Securityholder, the Representative shall provide such
Securityholder with an accounting of all Representative Losses paid by the
Representative in its capacity as such. The Securityholders acknowledge and
agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal
of the Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated
by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Representative without the prior
written consent of the non-assigning Parties, _provided_ that Parent and
Merger Sub may assign this Agreement (in whole but not in part) to one or more
Affiliates of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger
Sub of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

13.05 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  

13.06 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings

items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or
outside of the ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the fact of
the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this

settlement agreement with respect thereto, in accordance with the procedures,
limitations of liability and Representative authority set forth in this

compliance with the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv)) shall not be deemed to
implicate the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii) or require the prior written
approval of any Securityholder pursuant to the previous sentence. No waiver of
any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or
affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or
default.

contract, each other Party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party hereto or to any such
contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a
