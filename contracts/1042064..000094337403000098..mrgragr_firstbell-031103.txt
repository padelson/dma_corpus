         (b) At the Merger  Effective  Date, by virtue of the Merger and without

         Section 2.03.  Exchange Procedures.

         (a) As promptly as practicable  after the Merger Effective Date, and in

mail to each holder of record of outstanding shares of First Bell Bancorp Common
Stock a letter of  transmittal  in form and substance  reasonably  acceptable to

surrender of the Certificate(s) held by such holder for payment therefor. Upon a
holder's  surrender of the  Certificate(s)  to the Exchange  Agent in accordance

promptly receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon.  Neither Northwest Bancorp nor the Exchange Agent shall be obligated to
deliver the Merger  Consideration to a former  stockholder of First Bell Bancorp
until such former stockholder surrenders his Certificate(s).

         (b) If payment of the  Merger  Consideration  is to be made to a Person
other  than the  Person in whose  name a  Certificate  surrendered  in  exchange
therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate
so  surrendered  shall be properly  endorsed (or  accompanied  by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,  and that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason  of the  payment  to a Person  other  than the  registered  holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to
the  satisfaction  of the  Exchange  Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

         (c)  Contemporaneously  with or prior to the Merger,  Northwest Bancorp
and/or Northwest  Savings Bank shall deposit or cause to be deposited,  in trust
with the  Exchange  Agent,  an  amount  of cash  equal to the  aggregate  Merger
Consideration  that the First Bell  Bancorp  stockholders  shall be  entitled to
receive on the Merger Effective Date pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof (determined
by multiplying  the Merger  Consideration  by the number of shares of First Bell
Bancorp Common Stock which are issued and outstanding  immediately  prior to the
Merger Effective Date, other than shares  referenced in Section  2.02(a)(ii) and
(iii) hereof).

         (d) The payment of the Merger  Consideration upon the exchange of First
Bell Bancorp  Common Stock in accordance  with the terms and  conditions  hereof
shall constitute full  satisfaction of all rights  pertaining to such First Bell
Bancorp Common Stock.

<PAGE>

         (e) Promptly  following  the date which is twelve (12) months after the
Merger  Effective  Date,  Northwest  Bancorp may request the  Exchange  Agent to
deliver to Northwest  Bancorp all cash,  Certificates and other documents in its
possession  relating to the transactions  described in this Agreement,  in which
case the Exchange Agent's duties shall terminate.  In such event, each holder of
a Certificate  formerly  representing  shares of First Bell Bancorp Common Stock
may surrender such  Certificate to Northwest  Bancorp and (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive in consideration therefore
the  Merger  Consideration  multiplied  by the  number of  shares of First  Bell
Bancorp  Common Stock  formerly  represented  by such  Certificate,  without any
interest or dividends thereon.

         (f) As of the close of business  on the Merger  Effective  Date,  there
shall be no transfers on the stock  transfer  books of First Bell Bancorp of the
shares of First Bell  Bancorp  Common  Stock which are  outstanding  immediately
prior to the Merger  Effective  Date, and the stock transfer books of First Bell
Bancorp  shall be closed  with  respect  to such  shares.  If,  after the Merger
Effective Date, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer
to the  Exchange  Agent,  they shall be canceled  and  exchanged  for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article II.

         (g) In the event any  Certificate  for First Bell Bancorp  Common Stock
shall have been lost,  stolen or  destroyed,  the Exchange  Agent (or  Northwest
Bancorp,  if the Exchange Agent's duties  hereunder have been discharged)  shall
deliver in exchange  for such lost,  stolen or destroyed  certificate,  upon the
making of an affidavit of the fact by the holder thereof, the cash to be paid in
the Merger as provided for herein;  provided,  however,  that Northwest  Bancorp
may,  in its  sole  discretion  and as a  condition  precedent  to the  delivery
thereof,  require the owner of such lost,  stolen or  destroyed  Certificate  to
deliver a bond in such  reasonable  sum as  Northwest  Bancorp may  determine as
indemnity  against  any  claim  that may be made  against  First  Bell  Bancorp,
Northwest Bancorp or any other party with respect to the Certificate  alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.04 sets forth all of the outstanding First Bell Bancorp Options as of the date
hereof,  all of which are vested and exercisable.  At the Merger Effective Date,

the right to receive in cash an amount equal to (i) the  difference  between (A)
the  Merger  Consideration  and (B) the  exercise  price of each such First Bell
Bancorp  Option  multiplied  by (ii) the number of shares of First Bell  Bancorp
Common Stock subject to the First Bell Bancorp Option. First Bell Bancorp agrees
to take or to  cause to be taken  all  actions  necessary  to  provide  for such
payment at or prior to the Merger  Effective  Date, and shall use its reasonable
best  efforts to obtain the  written  acknowledgement  of each  holder of a then
outstanding  First Bell Bancorp  Option with regard to the  termination  of such
Option  and the full  payment  therefor  in  accordance  with the  terms of this
Agreement.

         Section 2.05.  Restricted Stock. First Bell Bancorp Disclosure Schedule
2.05 sets forth all  outstanding  unvested awards under the Bell Federal Savings
Restricted  Stock Plan. At the Merger  Effective Date, each unvested  restricted
share of First Bell Bancorp Common Stock granted under the Bell Federal  Savings
Restricted Stock Plan which is outstanding at such time

                                       11
<PAGE>

shall vest and become free of all  restrictions.  Each holder of such a share of
restricted  First Bell Bancorp Common Stock shall have the same right to receive
the Merger  Consideration  as is  provided  to each  holder of First Bell Common
Stock.  First Bell  Bancorp  agrees to take or to cause to be taken all  actions
necessary to provide for such payment at or prior to the Merger  Effective Date,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written  acknowledgement
of each holder of a share of  restricted  First Bell  Bancorp  Common Stock with
regard  to the  payment  for  such  shares  and the  full  payment  therefor  in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

to employees of First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings;  (iii) any agreement

indebtedness  for  borrowed  money  whether  directly or  indirectly,  by way of
purchase  money  obligation,  conditional  sale,  lease  purchase,  guaranty  or
otherwise,  in respect of which First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings is an
obligor to any Person,  which  instrument  evidences or relates to  indebtedness
other  than  deposits,  repurchase  agreements,  FHLB  of  Pittsburgh  advances,
bankers'  acceptances,  "treasury  tax and  loan"  accounts  established  in the
ordinary  course  of  business  and  transactions  in  "federal  funds" or which
contains financial covenants or other restrictions (other than those relating to
the payment of principal  and interest when due) which would be applicable on or
after the Merger  Effective Date to Northwest  Bancorp or any Northwest  Bancorp
Subsidiary;  (v) any contract (other than this Agreement)  limiting the freedom,
in any respect,  of First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings to engage in any

         (b) Each real  estate  lease that may require the consent of the lessor
or its agent resulting from the Company Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of a
prohibition  or  restriction  relating to  assignment,  by  operation  of law or
otherwise,  or change in  control,  is listed in First Bell  Bancorp  Disclosure
Schedule  3.08(b)  identifying  the  section  of the lease  that  contains  such
prohibition or restriction.  Neither First Bell Bancorp nor Bell Federal Savings
is in  default  in  any  respect  under  any  contract,  agreement,  commitment,
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which it is a party,
by which its assets,  business, or operations may be bound or affected, or under
which it or its assets,  business, or operations receive benefits, and there has
not occurred  any event that,  with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a default.

         (c)  True  and  correct  copies  of  Material  Contracts,   agreements,
instruments,  contracts,  arrangements,  commitments,  leases or  understandings
identified in First Bell Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule  3.08(a) and 3.08(b) have
been made available to Northwest  Bancorp on or before the date hereof,  and are
in full force and effect on the date hereof and neither  First Bell  Bancorp nor

                                       17
<PAGE>

Bell Federal  Savings  (nor, to the Knowledge of First Bell Bancorp or any First
Bell  Bancorp  Subsidiary),  any other  party to any such  "Material  Contract,"
agreement, instrument, contract, arrangement, commitment, lease or understanding
has breached any  provision  of, or is in default in any respect  under any term
of, any such "Material Contract," agreement,  instrument, contract, arrangement,
commitment,  lease or  understanding.  Except as set forth in First Bell Bancorp
Disclosure  Schedule  3.08(c),  no  party  to  any  such  "Material   Contract,"
agreement, instrument, contract, arrangement, commitment, lease or understanding
will  have  the  right to  terminate  any or all of the  provisions  of any such
"Material Contract," agreement, instrument,  contract, arrangement,  commitment,
lease or  understanding  as a result of the execution  of, and the  transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement,  or require the payment of an early termination
fee or penalty. No such "Material Contract,"  agreement,  instrument,  contract,
arrangement,  commitment,  lease or understanding to which First Bell Bancorp or
Bell  Federal  Savings  is a party or under  which  First  Bell  Bancorp or Bell
Federal  Savings may be liable contains  provisions  which permit an independent
contractor  to terminate  it without  cause and after such  termination  without
cause continue to accrue future benefits thereunder.

         Section 3.09.  Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage.

         (a)  Except  as set forth in First  Bell  Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule
3.09(a),  First Bell Bancorp and the Bell Federal  Savings each has good and, as
to real property,  marketable  title to all material assets and properties owned
by First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings in the conduct of their business,
whether such assets and properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible,
including  assets and property  reflected in the balance sheets contained in the
First Bell Bancorp  Regulatory  Reports and in the First Bell Bancorp Financials
or  acquired  subsequent  thereto  (except  to the extent  that such  assets and
properties have been disposed of in the ordinary  course of business,  since the
date of such balance sheets), subject to no liens, mortgages, security interests
or pledges,  or to the  Knowledge of First Bell Bancorp,  adverse  encumbrances,
except  (i) those  items  which  secure  liabilities  for  public  or  statutory
obligations  or any discount with,  borrowing  from or other  obligations to the
FHLB of Pittsburgh,  inter-bank  credit  facilities,  or any transaction by Bell
Federal  Savings acting in a fiduciary  capacity,  and (ii) statutory  liens for
amounts not yet  delinquent  or which are being  contested in good faith.  First
Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings, as lessee, have the right under valid and
subsisting leases of real and personal properties used by First Bell Bancorp and
Bell Federal  Savings in the conduct of their business to occupy or use all such
properties as presently  occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases
and commitments to lease constitute  operating leases for both tax and financial
accounting  purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental  commitments  with
respect to such leases and lease  commitments  are as  disclosed in the notes to
the First Bell Bancorp Financials.

         (b) With respect to all agreements pursuant to which First Bell Bancorp
or Bell  Federal  Savings has  purchased  securities  subject to an agreement to
resell,  if any,  First  Bell  Bancorp  or Bell  Federal  Savings  has a lien or
security interest (which to First Bell Bancorp's Knowledge is a valid, perfected
first  lien) in the  securities  or other  collateral  securing  the  repurchase
agreement,  and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the
debt secured thereby.

                                       18
<PAGE>

         (c) First Bell  Bancorp and Bell  Federal  Savings  currently  maintain
insurance considered by First Bell Bancorp to be reasonable for their respective
operations.  First Bell  Bancorp  has not  received  notice  from any  insurance
carrier that (i) such  insurance  will be canceled or that  coverage  thereunder
will be reduced  or  eliminated,  or (ii)  premium  costs  with  respect to such
policies of insurance will be  substantially  increased.  There are presently no
claims  pending  under such policies of insurance and no notices have been given
by First Bell  Bancorp  under such  policies.  All such  insurance  is valid and
enforceable  and in full force and  effect,  and within the last three (3) years
First Bell Bancorp has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has
applied and during such  periods  has not been  denied  indemnification  for any
claims  submitted  under  any of its  insurance  policies.  First  Bell  Bancorp
Disclosure  Schedule 3.09(c) identifies all policies of insurance  maintained by
First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings.

         Section  3.10.  Legal  Proceedings.  Except as set forth in First  Bell
Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule 3.10,  neither First Bell Bancorp nor Bell Federal
Savings is a party to any,  and there are no  pending  or, to the  Knowledge  of
either  First  Bell  Bancorp  or  Bell  Federal   Savings,   threatened   legal,
administrative,  arbitration or other  proceedings,  claims (whether asserted or
unasserted),  actions or governmental  investigations or inquiries of any nature
(i) against First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings (other than routine bank
regulatory  examinations),  (ii) to which First Bell  Bancorp's  or Bell Federal
Savings'  assets are or may be subject,  or (iii)  challenging  the  validity or
propriety of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         Section 3.11.  Compliance With Applicable Law.

         (a)  Except  as set forth in First  Bell  Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule
3.11(a), since January 1, 1998, First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings each
was, and is, in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign
statutes,  laws, regulations,  ordinances,  rules, judgments,  orders or decrees
applicable to it, its  properties,  assets and deposits,  its business,  and its
conduct of business and its relationship with its employees,  including, without
limitation,  the  Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act,  the Fair  Housing  Act,  the
Community  Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act, the Bank
Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot  Act,  the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act of 1999 and all
other  applicable  fair lending laws and other laws  relating to  discriminatory
business practices.

         (b) First Bell Bancorp and Bell  Federal  Savings each has all permits,
licenses,  authorizations,  orders and  approvals  of, and has made all filings,
applications  and  registrations  with,  all  Regulatory  Authorities  that  are
required in order to permit it to own or lease its properties and to conduct its
business as presently  conducted;  all such permits,  licenses,  certificates of
authority,  orders  and  approvals  are in full  force and  effect  and,  to the
Knowledge of First Bell  Bancorp and Bell  Federal  Savings,  no  suspension  or
cancellation  of any such  permit,  license,  certificate,  order or approval is
threatened or will result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

         (c) Other than as set forth in First Bell Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule
3.11(c),  neither  First Bell Bancorp nor Bell Federal  Savings has received any
notification or communication  from any Regulatory  Authority (i) asserting that
First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings is not

                                       19
<PAGE>

in compliance  with any of the  statutes,  regulations  or ordinances  that such
Regulatory   Authority  enforces;   (ii)  threatening  to  revoke  any  license,
franchise,  permit or governmental  authorization  of First Bell Bancorp or Bell
Federal Savings; (iii) requiring or threatening to require First Bell Bancorp or
Bell  Federal  Savings,  or  indicating  that First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal
Savings may be required,  to enter into a cease and desist  order,  agreement or
memorandum of  understanding  or any other  agreement  with any federal or state
governmental  agency  or  authority  that is  charged  with the  supervision  or
regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of bank deposits  restricting or
limiting,  or purporting to restrict or limit,  in any respect the operations of
First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings,  including  without  limitation any
restriction  on the payment of  dividends;  or (iv)  directing,  restricting  or
limiting,  or  purporting  to  direct,  restrict  or limit,  in any  manner  the
operations  of First Bell Bancorp or Bell  Federal  Savings,  including  without
limitation  any  restriction  on the  payment  of  dividends  (any such  notice,
communication,  memorandum,  agreement or order  described  in this  sentence is
hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory Agreement"). Neither First Bell Bancorp
nor Bell  Federal  Savings  has  consented  to or  entered  into  any  currently
effective Regulatory Agreement.  The most recent regulatory rating given to Bell
Federal Savings as to compliance with the Community  Reinvestment Act ("CRA") is
satisfactory or better.

         Section 3.12.  Employee Benefit Plans.

         (a) First Bell Bancorp Disclosure  Schedule 3.12 includes a list of all
existing Compensation and Benefit Plans. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan that
is an "employee  pension  benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) (a
"Pension  Plan") and which is intended to be qualified  under Section  401(a) of
the Code (a "First Bell Bancorp or Bell  Federal  Savings  Qualified  Plan") has
received  a  favorable  determination  letter  from  the IRS or was a  prototype
document  that has  received a  favorable  letter  from the IRS,  and First Bell
Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings have no Knowledge of any  circumstances  likely
to result in revocation of any such favorable  determination  letter.  There has
been no announcement  or commitment by First Bell Bancorp,  Bell Federal Savings
or any of its  Subsidiaries  to create an  additional  Compensation  and Benefit
Plan,  or to amend any  Compensation  and Benefit  Plan,  except for  amendments
required by applicable law to maintain its qualified status or otherwise,  which
do not increase the cost of such Compensation and Benefit Plan.

         (b)  Each   Compensation   and  Benefit  Plan  has  been  operated  and
administered  in all respects in accordance  with its terms and with  applicable
law,  including,  but not limited to, ERISA,  the Code, the Securities  Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age  Discrimination  in Employment Act, and any regulations or
rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings,  disclosures and notices required
by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely made.  Except as
set  forth  in First  Bell  Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule  3.12(b),  there is no
pending,  or to the  Knowledge  of First Bell  Bancorp  threatened,  litigation,
administrative  action,  suit or claim relating to any of the  Compensation  and
Benefit  Plans  (other than routine  claims for  benefits).  Neither  First Bell
Bancorp nor Bell  Federal  Savings has engaged in a  transaction,  or omitted to
take any action,  with respect to any  Compensation  and Benefit Plan that would
reasonably be expected to subject First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings to
a tax or penalty  imposed by either  Section  4975 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the

                                       20
<PAGE>

taxable  period  of any  such  transaction  expired  as of the date  hereof  and
subsequently  expires as of the day next  preceding the Merger  Effective  Date.
Except as set forth in First Bell Bancorp Disclosure  Schedule 3.12(b),  each of
the Compensation and Benefit Plan can be terminated in accordance with its terms
upon sixty (60) days written notice.

         (c) No  liability  under  Title IV of ERISA has been  incurred by First
Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings or any of its Subsidiaries  with respect to
any Compensation and Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, or with
respect to any  "single-employer  plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA)
("First  Bell  Bancorp or Bell  Federal  Savings  Pension  Plan")  currently  or
formerly  maintained by First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings or any entity
which is considered one employer with First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings
under  Section  4001(b)(1)  of ERISA  or  Section  414 of the  Code  (an  "ERISA
Affiliate")  since the  effective  date of ERISA that has not been  satisfied in
full, and no condition exists that presents a risk to First Bell Bancorp or Bell
Federal  Savings or any ERISA  Affiliate  of  incurring a  liability  under such
Title.  No First  Bell  Bancorp  or Bell  Federal  Savings  Pension  Plan had an
"accumulated  funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA),  whether
or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year ending
prior to the date hereof; the fair market value of the assets of each First Bell
Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings  Pension Plan exceeds the present  value of the
"benefit  liabilities"  (as defined in Section  4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such
First Bell  Bancorp or Bell  Federal  Savings  Pension Plan as of the end of the
most recent plan year with respect to the respective  First Bell Bancorp or Bell
Federal Savings Pension Plan ending prior to the date hereof,  calculated on the
basis of the actuarial  assumptions used in the most recent actuarial  valuation
for such First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings Pension Plan as of the date
hereof;  there is not currently pending with the PBGC any filing with respect to
any reportable  event under Section 4043 of ERISA nor has any  reportable  event
occurred as to which a filing is  required  and has not been made (other than as
might  be  required  with  respect  to  this  Agreement  and  the   transactions
contemplated  thereby).  Neither First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings nor
any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any  "multiemployer  plan," as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, on or after  September 26, 1980.  Except as set forth in
First Bell Bancorp's Disclosure Schedule 3.12(c),  neither First Bell Bancorp or
Bell Federal Savings, nor any ERISA Affiliate,  nor any Compensation and Benefit
Plan, including any First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings Pension Plan, nor
any trust  created  thereunder,  nor any  trustee or  administrator  thereof has
engaged in a  transaction  in  connection  with which First Bell Bancorp or Bell

reasonably  likely  to  become  non-deductible,  in whole  or in  part,  for tax
reporting  purposes as a result of the  limitations  under Section 162(m) of the
Code and the regulations issued thereunder.

         (i)  Except  as set forth in First  Bell  Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule
3.12(i),  the  consummation  of the  Merger  will not,  directly  or  indirectly
(including without  limitation,  as a result of any termination of employment or
service at any time prior to or following the Merger  Effective  Date),  entitle
any current or former employee, director or independent contractor of First Bell
Bancorp or Bell  Federal  Savings to any actual or deemed  payment (or  benefit)
which would constitute a "parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section
280G of the Code).

accruing or the

                                       24
<PAGE>

loans are less than 90 days past due,  (5) where the  interest  rate  terms have
been reduced  and/or the maturity  dates have been  extended  subsequent  to the
agreement under which the loan was originally  created due to concerns regarding
the  borrower's  ability to pay in accordance  with such initial  terms,  or (6)
where a specific reserve allocation exists in connection therewith,  and (B) all
assets  classified by First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings as real estate
acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure,  including  in-substance
foreclosures,  and all other assets  currently  held that were acquired  through
foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure.

         (c) To the  Knowledge of First Bell  Bancorp and Bell Federal  Savings,
all loans receivable  (including  discounts) and accrued interest entered on the
books of First Bell  Bancorp  and Bell  Federal  Savings  arose out of bona fide
arm's-length transactions,  were made for good and valuable consideration in the
ordinary  course of First Bell  Bancorp's  or Bell Federal  Savings'  respective
business,  and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness with respect to such
loans (including  discounts) are to the Knowledge of First Bell Bancorp true and
genuine  and are what they  purport  to be.  Except  as set forth in First  Bell
Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule 3.15, to the Knowledge of First Bell Bancorp,  the
loans,  discounts and the accrued interest  reflected on the books of First Bell
Bancorp  and Bell  Federal  Savings  are  subject to no  defenses,  set-offs  or
counterclaims  (including,  without  limitation,  those  afforded  by  usury  or
truth-in-lending  laws), except as may be provided by bankruptcy,  insolvency or
similar laws affecting  creditors' rights generally or by general  principles of
equity.  All such loans are owned by First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings
free and clear of any liens, except for liens for taxes, assessments, or similar
charges,  incurred in the ordinary  course of business and which are not yet due
and payable,  and liens in favor of the FHLB of Pittsburgh to secure advances of
the FHLB of Pittsburgh to Bell Federal Savings.

         (d) To the  Knowledge of First Bell  Bancorp and Bell Federal  Savings,
the notes and other evidences of indebtedness  evidencing the loans described in
Section  3.15(c)  above,  and all pledges,  mortgages,  deeds of trust and other
collateral  documents  or  security  instruments  relating  thereto  are, in all
respects, valid, true and genuine, and what they purport to be.

         Section  3.16.  Securities  Documents.  First  Bell  Bancorp  has  made
available to Northwest Bancorp copies of its (i) annual reports on Form 10-K for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, (ii) quarterly reports on Form

and (iii) proxy  materials used in connection  with its meetings of stockholders
held in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Such reports and such proxy materials complied,  at
the time filed with the SEC, with the Securities Laws.

         Section 3.17. Related Party Transactions.  Except as described in First
Bell Bancorp's  Proxy  Statement  distributed in connection with the 2002 annual
meeting  of  stockholders  or as  otherwise  set  forth  in First  Bell  Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule 3.17, neither First Bell Bancorp nor Bell Federal Savings is
a party to any  transaction  (including any loan or other credit  accommodation)
with any Affiliate of First Bell Bancorp. All such transactions (a) were made in
the ordinary course of business,  (b) were made on substantially the same terms,
including  interest rates and  collateral,  as those  prevailing at the time for
comparable  transactions  with other Persons,  and (c) did not involve more than
the normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. No loan
or credit  accommodation  to any Affiliate of First Bell Bancorp or

                                       25
<PAGE>

Bell  Federal  Savings is  presently  in default  or,  during the three (3) year
period  prior to the date of this  Agreement,  has been in  default  or has been
restructured,  modified or extended. Neither First Bell Bancorp nor Bell Federal
Savings has been notified  that  principal and interest with respect to any such
loan or other  credit  accommodation  will not be paid when due or that the loan
grade  classification  accorded such loan or credit  accommodation by First Bell
Bancorp is inappropriate.

         Section  3.18.  Schedule of  Termination  Benefits.  First Bell Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule 3.18 includes a description of all termination  benefits and
related payments (including dollar amounts) that would or will be payable to the
individuals identified thereon, excluding any First Bell Bancorp Options granted
to  such  individuals,   under  any  and  all  employment  agreements,   special
termination  agreements,  change in control agreements,  supplemental  executive
retirement plans,  deferred bonus plans,  deferred  compensation  plans,  salary
continuation plans, or any compensation arrangement, or other pension benefit or
welfare  benefit plan  maintained by First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings
for the benefit of officers or  directors  of First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal
Savings (the  "Benefits  Schedule"),  assuming  their  employment  or service is
terminated  as of July  31,  2003  and the  Closing  Date  occurs  prior to such
termination, and provided, however, that the dollar amounts of such benefits and
payments need not be provided for any  tax-qualified  pension plan,  any insured
welfare benefit plan, the First Bell Bancorp Stock Option Plan, the Bell Federal
Savings Restricted Stock Plan, the First Bell Bancorp Dividend  Reinvestment and
Stock  Purchase  Plan,  the  severance  provisions  of  Section  5.11(f) of this
Agreement  or the  miscellaneous  benefits  set  forth  in  First  Bell  Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule 3.12(a). No other individuals are entitled to benefits under
any such plans.

         Section 3.19.  Deposits.  None of the deposits of First Bell Bancorp or
Bell  Federal  Savings is a  "brokered  deposit"  as  defined in 12 CFR  Section
337.6(a)(2).

         Section 3.20.  Antitakeover Provisions Inapplicable.

         (a) Assuming  that the  representation  and warranty of Northwest  MHC,
Northwest  Bancorp and  Northwest  Savings  Bank  contained  in Section  4.11 is
accurate, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not subject to the
requirements  of any  "moratorium,"  "control  share," "fair price,"  "affiliate
transactions," "business combination" or other antitakeover laws and regulations
of any state.  The affirmative  vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of First Bell Bancorp  Common Stock is required to approve this Agreement
under First Bell Bancorp's certificate of incorporation and the DGCL.

         (b) First  Bell  Bancorp  has taken  all  necessary  action so that the
entering  into  of  this  Agreement  and the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement  do not and will not result in the grant of any
rights to any Person under the First Bell Bancorp Rights  Agreement or enable or
require the First Bell  Bancorp  Rights  issuable  thereunder  to be  exercised,
distributed or triggered, and to otherwise ensure that none of Northwest Bancorp
or any of its  Affiliates  is or  becomes an  Acquiring  Person (as such term is
defined in the First Bell Bancorp  Rights  Agreement) by reason of the execution
of this  Agreement or  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  and that a  Distribution  Date (as such term is defined in the First
Bell Bancorp Rights Agreement) does not occur by reason of the execution of

                                       26

this  Agreement  or  consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this

Agreement that has been adopted by First Bell Bancorp.

Bell Federal Savings is under any obligation, contingent or otherwise, that will
survive the Merger  Effective  Date by reason of any  agreement  to register any
transaction involving any of its securities under the Securities Act.

         Section 3.22.  Risk  Management  Instruments.  All interest rate swaps,
caps, floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar
risk management arrangements, whether entered into for the account of First Bell
Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings or their  customers (all of which are set forth
in First Bell Bancorp Disclosure  Schedule 3.22) were entered into in accordance
with  prudent  business  practices  and in all respects in  compliance  with all
applicable   laws,   rules,   regulations  and  regulatory   policies  and  with
counterparties  believed to be financially  responsible at the time; and each of
them constitutes the valid and legally binding  obligation of First Bell Bancorp
or Bell Federal  Savings,  enforceable  in accordance  with its terms (except as
enforceability   may  be   limited   by   applicable   bankruptcy,   insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium,  fraudulent  transfer  and similar  laws of general
applicability  relating to or affecting  creditors'  rights or by general equity
principles),  and is in full force and effect.  Neither First Bell Bancorp, Bell
Federal  Savings,  nor to the  Knowledge  of First Bell  Bancorp any other party
thereto,  is in breach of any of its  obligations  under any such  agreement  or
arrangement in any respect.

         Section  3.23.  Fairness  Opinion.  First Bell  Bancorp has  received a
written opinion from Lehman Brothers dated as of the date of this Agreement,  to
the effect that,  subject to the terms,  conditions and qualifications set forth
therein, as of the date thereof,  the Merger Consideration to be received by the
stockholders  of First Bell Bancorp  pursuant to this  Agreement is fair to such
stockholders from a financial point of view.

         Section  3.24.  Intellectual  Property.  First  Bell  Bancorp  and  its
Subsidiaries  owns or, to the Knowledge of First Bell Bancorp,  possesses  valid
and binding  licenses  and other rights to use all  patents,  copyrights,  trade
secrets, trade names, servicemarks and trademarks used in their businesses, each
without payment,  and neither First Bell Bancorp nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice of conflict with respect  thereto that asserts the rights of
others.  First  Bell  Bancorp  and  its  Subsidiaries,  has  performed  all  the
obligations  required to be  performed,  and are not in default in any  respect,
under any contract, agreement,  arrangement or commitment relating to any of the
foregoing.

         Section 3.25. Bank Owned Life Insurance.  First Bell Bancorp Disclosure
Schedule 3.09(c) sets forth a true, correct and complete description of all Bank
Owned Life Insurance  ("BOLI") owned by First Bell Bancorp or its  Subsidiaries.
The value of such BOLI as of the date hereof is fairly and accurately  reflected
on the First Bell Bancorp Financials in accordance with GAAP.

         Section 5.04.  Taking of Necessary Action.

         (a) Subject to the terms and  conditions of this  Agreement,  Northwest
MHC, Northwest Bancorp and First Bell Bancorp shall each use its reasonable best

actions,  and to do,  or cause to be  done,  all  things  necessary,  proper  or
advisable under  applicable laws so as to permit  consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable after the date

satisfaction  of the  conditions  set  forth in  Article  VI  hereof,  and shall
cooperate fully with the other parties hereto to that end. No party hereto shall
take,  or cause,  or to the best of its ability  permit to be taken,  any action
that would  substantially  impair the prospects of completing the Merger and the

         (b) First Bell Bancorp shall prepare, subject to the review and consent
by Northwest  Bancorp with respect to matters relating to Northwest  Bancorp and

Bell Bancorp in connection with the meeting of its  stockholders to consider the
adoption of this Agreement, which Proxy Statement shall conform

to all applicable  legal  requirements  and be filed in preliminary  form within
forty (40) days after the date hereof.  The parties  shall  cooperate  with each
other with respect to the preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall use their

in the Proxy  Statement  will not, at the time the Proxy  Statement is mailed to
First Bell Bancorp  stockholders  and the date of the meeting of stockholders of
First Bell  Bancorp to which such Proxy  Statement  relates,  contain any untrue
statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any material  fact  necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading.

         Section 5.05. Certain Agreements.

         (a) From and after the Merger  Effective  Date,  Northwest  Bancorp and
Northwest  Savings  Bank,  jointly and  severally  shall to the  fullest  extent
permitted  under  applicable  law, agree to indemnify,  defend and hold harmless
each present and former director and/or officer of First Bell Bancorp or a First
Bell  Bancorp  Subsidiary  as of the  Merger  Effective  Date (the  "Indemnified
Parties")  against all  losses,  claims,  damages,  costs,  expenses  (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), liabilities, judgments or amounts paid
in settlement (with the approval of Northwest Bancorp,  which approval shall not
be  unreasonably  withheld)  or in  connection  with any  claim,  action,  suit,
proceeding or  investigation  arising out of matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Merger Effective Date (a "Claim") in which an Indemnified Party is,
or is  threatened to be made, a party or a witness based in whole or in part on,
or  arising  in  whole  or in part  out of,  (i) the  fact  that he or she was a
director or officer of First Bell Bancorp or a Subsidiary  of First Bell Bancorp
or is or was serving at the  request of First Bell  Bancorp or a  Subsidiary  of
First Bell  Bancorp as a  director,  officer,  employee,  fiduciary  or agent of
another  corporation  or  of  a  partnership,  joint  venture,  trust  or  other
enterprise,  including  services with respect to an employee  benefit plan,  and
(ii) matters  related to the  negotiation,  execution  and  performance  of this
Agreement or any of the transactions  contemplated hereby, regardless of whether
such Claim is  asserted  or claimed  prior to, at or after the Merger  Effective
Date, to the fullest extent to which such Indemnified Parties are entitled under
the DGCL,  First Bell Bancorp's  certificate of  incorporation  and bylaws,  the
equivalent  documents of any First Bell Bancorp  Subsidiary or other  applicable
law as in effect on the date hereof (and Northwest Bancorp shall pay expenses in
advance  of the  final  disposition  of any such  action or  proceeding  to each
Indemnified Party to the extent permissible to a Delaware  corporation under the
DGCL and First Bell  Bancorp's  certificate  of  incorporation  and bylaws as in
effect on the date hereof; provided, that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses
are advanced  provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification).  All
rights to  indemnification  in respect of a Claim shall continue until the final
disposition  of such Claim.  No  indemnification  shall be  required  under this
Section 5.05(a) if prohibited by applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing,
Northwest  Bancorp and  Northwest  Savings Bank also agree that  limitations  on
liability  existing in favor of the  Indemnified  Parties in the  certificate of
incorporation  or bylaws of First Bell Bancorp or the equivalent  documents of a
First Bell  Bancorp  Subsidiary  as in effect on the date hereof with respect to
matters occurring

                                       39
<PAGE>

prior to the Merger  Effective Date shall survive the Mergers and shall continue
in full force and effect after the Merger Effective Date.

         (b) Any  Indemnified  Party  wishing  to  claim  indemnification  under
Section  5.05(a),  upon learning of any Claim,  shall promptly notify  Northwest
Bancorp, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Northwest Bancorp of any
liability it may have to such  Indemnified  Party except to the extent that such
failure  materially  prejudices  Northwest  Bancorp.  In the event of any Claim,
Northwest  Bancorp  shall have the right to assume  the  defense  thereof  (with
counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Indemnified  Party)  and shall not be
liable to such  Indemnified  Party for any legal expenses of other legal counsel
or any  other  expenses  subsequently  incurred  by such  Indemnified  Party  in
connection with the defense  thereof,  except that, if Northwest  Bancorp elects
not to assume such  defense or counsel for the  Indemnified  Party  advises that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Northwest Bancorp and
the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel  satisfactory to
him or her, and Northwest  Bancorp shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such  counsel for the  Indemnified  Party  promptly as  statements  therefor are
received,  provided  that (1) Northwest  Bancorp shall be obligated  pursuant to
this  Section  5.05(b) to pay for only one firm of counsel  for all  Indemnified
Parties in  connection  with any one action or  separate  but similar or related
actions  in  the  same  jurisdiction  arising  out of the  same  allegations  or
circumstances,  (2) the  Indemnified  Party will cooperate in the defense of any
such Claim and (3)  Northwest  Bancorp  shall not be liable  for any  settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not unreasonably
be withheld).

         (c) Northwest  Bancorp shall  maintain in effect for six (6) years from
the Merger  Effective  Date,  the current  directors'  and  officers'  liability
insurance  policy  maintained  by First Bell Bancorp  (provided  that  Northwest
Bancorp  may  substitute  therefor  policies  of  at  least  the  same  coverage
containing  terms and conditions  which are not materially  less favorable) with
respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Date,  provided
that in no event shall  Northwest  Bancorp be required to spend for any one year
an amount in excess of 175% of the annual  premium  currently paid by First Bell
Bancorp for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"). In the event that Northwest
Bancorp is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section
5.05(c) as a result of the previous  sentence,  Northwest  Bancorp shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain or obtain the most advantageous  coverage as
is available for the Insurance Amount.  In connection with the foregoing,  First
Bell  Bancorp  agrees to provide such  insurer or  substitute  insurer with such
representations  as such  insurer may  reasonably  request  with  respect to the
reporting of any prior claims. Northwest Bancorp agrees to provide to First Bell
Bancorp  legally binding  evidence of the foregoing  insurance not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

         (d) In the event Northwest  Bancorp,  Northwest  Savings Bank or any of
its respective  successors or assigns (1)  consolidates  with or merges into any
other Person and shall not continue or survive such  consolidation or merger, or
(2) transfers or conveys all or  substantially  all of its properties and assets
to any Person,  then,  and in each such case,  to the extent  necessary,  proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Northwest  Bancorp
or Northwest  Savings Bank, as applicable,  assume the  obligations set forth in
this Section 5.05.

                                       40
<PAGE>

         (e) The  provisions  of this  Section  5.05 are  intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each  Indemnified  Party and his or her
heirs and representatives.

         Section  5.06.  No Other Bids and Related  Matters.  From and after the
date hereof until the termination of this Agreement, neither First Bell Bancorp,
nor Bell  Federal  Savings  will,  nor will they permit any of their  respective
officers,   directors,   employees,   representatives,   agents  or   affiliates
(including,  without limitation,  any investment banker,  attorney or accountant
retained  by First  Bell  Bancorp  or Bell  Federal  Savings)  to,  directly  or
indirectly,  initiate,  solicit or  encourage  (including  by way of  furnishing
non-public  information  or  assistance),  or  facilitate,  any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that  constitutes,  or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition  Proposal (as defined  below),  or enter into or maintain or
continue  discussions  or  negotiate  with any  Person  in  furtherance  of such
inquiries  or to obtain  an  Acquisition  Proposal  or agree to or  endorse  any
Acquisition  Proposal,  or authorize or permit any of its  officers,  directors,
employees,  investment bankers,  financial advisors,  attorneys,  accountants or
other  representatives  to take any such action,  and First Bell  Bancorp  shall
notify  Northwest  Bancorp  orally  (within one Business Day) and in writing (as
promptly as  practicable  but no later than three  Business  Days) of all of the
relevant details relating to all inquiries and proposals that it or Bell Federal
Savings or any such officer,  director employee,  investment  banker,  financial
advisor,  attorney,  accountant or other  representative may receive relating to
any of  such  matters  and  provide  Northwest  Bancorp  a copy  of all  written
communication between First Bell Bancorp and the third party, provided, however,
that  nothing  contained  in this  Section  5.06  shall  prohibit  the  Board of
Directors of First Bell Bancorp from (i) furnishing  information to, or entering
into  discussions  or  negotiations  with any Person  that makes an  unsolicited
written,  bona fide  proposal,  to acquire  First Bell  Bancorp or Bell  Federal
Savings  pursuant  to  a  merger,   consolidation,   share  exchange,   business
combination, tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, if, and only
to the extent that,  (A) the Board of Directors of First Bell Bancorp is advised
in  writing by its  independent  financial  advisor  that such  proposal  may be
superior to the Merger from a financial  point-of-view  to First Bell  Bancorp's
stockholders,   (B)  the  Board  of  Directors  of  First  Bell  Bancorp,  after
consultation  with and based  upon the  advice  of  independent  legal  counsel,
determines  in good faith that failure to take such action could  reasonably  be
expected  to  constitute  a breach of such  directors'  fiduciary  duties  under
applicable law (any proposal that satisfies (A) and (B) being referred to herein
as a "Superior  Proposal"),  (C) prior to  furnishing  such  information  to, or
entering into  discussions or negotiations  with,  such person or entity,  First
Bell Bancorp (x) provides  reasonable  notice to Northwest Bancorp to the effect
that  it  is  furnishing   information  to,  or  entering  into  discussions  or
negotiations with, such person or entity (identifying such person or entity) and
(y) receives  from such person or entity an executed  confidentiality  agreement
substantially   identical  in  all  material  respects  to  the  Confidentiality
Agreement,  and (D) the First Bell Bancorp meeting of  stockholders  convened to
approve  this  Agreement  has not  occurred,  (ii)  complying  with  Rule  14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer, or
(iii) prior to the meeting of  stockholders  of First Bell  Bancorp  convened to
approve  this  Agreement,  failing  to  make or  withdrawing  or  modifying  its
recommendation to stockholders,  if the Board of Directors of First Bell Bancorp
determines  after  consultation  with and based upon the  advice of  independent
legal counsel,  that failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of such directors'  fiduciary  duties under  applicable law.
For purposes of this  Agreement,  "Acquisition  Proposal"  shall mean any of the
following (other than the transactions  contemplated  hereunder) involving First
Bell

                                       41
<PAGE>

Bancorp  or any of its  Subsidiaries:  (i) any  offer or  proposal  for,  or any
indication  of  interest  in,  any  merger,   consolidation,   share   exchange,
recapitalization,  business combination, or other similar transaction;  (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 20% or
more of the  assets  of  First  Bell  Bancorp,  taken  as a  whole,  in a single
transaction or series of transactions;  (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer
for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of First Bell Bancorp
or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection
therewith;  or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal,  plan or intention to
do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

         Section  5.07.  Duty to Advise;  Duty to Update  First  Bell  Bancorp's
Disclosure Schedules. First Bell Bancorp shall promptly advise Northwest Bancorp
in writing of any change or event having a Material  Adverse  Effect on it or on
Bell Federal Savings or that it believes would or would be reasonably  likely to
cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,  warranties
or  covenants  set forth  herein.  First Bell  Bancorp  shall  update First Bell
Bancorp's  Disclosure  Schedules as promptly as practicable after the occurrence
of an event or fact that,  if such event or fact had occurred  prior to the date
of  this  Agreement,  would  have  been  disclosed  in the  First  Bell  Bancorp
Disclosure  Schedules.  The delivery of such updated  Schedule shall not relieve
First Bell Bancorp from any breach or violation of this  Agreement and shall not
have  any  effect  for the  purposes  of  determining  the  satisfaction  of the
condition set forth in Section 6.02(c) hereof.

         Section 5.08.  Conduct of Business of Northwest MHC,  Northwest Bancorp
and Northwest Savings Bank. From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
Northwest MHC,  Northwest  Bancorp and Northwest  Savings Bank each will use its
reasonable good faith efforts to (x) preserve its business organizations intact,
(y) maintain good relationships with its employees,  and (z) preserve for itself
the  goodwill of its  customers.  From the date of this  Agreement to the Merger
Effective Date, none of Northwest MHC, Northwest Bancorp, Northwest Savings Bank
and  Northwest  Merger  Subsidiary  will (i)  amend  its  charter  or  bylaws or
equivalent  documents  in any  manner  inconsistent  with the  prompt and timely
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement;  (ii) take any
action  that  would  result  in any of the  representations  and  warranties  of
Northwest  MHC,  Northwest  Bancorp or Northwest  Savings Bank set forth in this
Agreement  becoming untrue as of any date after the date hereof or in any of the
conditions  set forth in Article VI hereof not being  satisfied,  except in each
case as may be required by applicable  law; (iii) take any action which would or
is reasonably  likely to adversely effect or materially delay the receipt of the
Regulatory Approvals or other necessary approvals;  (iv) take action which would
or is reasonably  likely to materially  and adversely  affect  Northwest  MHC's,
Northwest  Bancorp's,  Northwest Savings Bank's or Northwest Merger Subsidiary's
ability to perform its covenants and agreements  under this Agreement;  (v) take
any action that would  result in any of the  conditions  to the Merger not being
satisfied,  including  without  limitation  the  condition  set forth at Section
6.02(h); or (vi) agree to do any of the foregoing.

         Section 5.09. Board and Committee Minutes.  First Bell Bancorp and Bell
Federal Savings shall each provide to Northwest Bancorp, within thirty (30) days
after any  meeting of their  respective  Board of  Directors,  or any  committee

meeting, except for information relating to

                                       42
<PAGE>

the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and deemed  confidential by the
Board of Directors  (including without limitation matters relating to (i) merger
negotiations,  (ii) Section 5.06 or (iii)  discussions  of possible  breaches of
this Agreement by Northwest MHC,  Northwest  Bancorp and Northwest Savings Bank)
or subject to the  attorney-client  privilege,  except that with  respect to any
meeting held within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date,  such minutes shall be
provided to each party prior to the Closing Date.

         Section 5.10. Undertakings by First Bell Bancorp and Northwest Bancorp.

         (a)   From and after the date of this Agreement:

                   (i) Outside Service Bureau  Contracts.  If requested to do so
by Northwest  Bancorp,  First Bell Bancorp shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain an extension of any contract with an outside  service  bureau or other
vendor of  services  to First Bell  Bancorp,  on terms and  conditions  mutually
acceptable to First Bell Bancorp and Northwest Bancorp;

                   (ii) List of Nonperforming  Assets.  First Bell Bancorp shall
provide Northwest Bancorp,  within fifteen (15) days of the end of each calendar
month, a written list of nonperforming assets (the term "nonperforming  assets,"
for purposes of this  Section  5.10(a)(ii),  means (i) loans that are  "troubled
debt  restructurings" as defined in Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
No. 15,  "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt  Restructuring,"
(ii) loans on  nonaccrual,  (iii) real estate owned,  (iv) all loans ninety (90)
days or more past due as of the end of such month and (iv) impaired loans;

                   (iii)  Reserves and Merger  Related  Costs.  On or before the
Merger  Effective  Date,  and at the request of  Northwest  Bancorp,  First Bell
Bancorp  shall  establish  such  additional  accruals  and  reserves  as  may be
necessary to conform the  accounting  reserve  practices and methods  (including
credit loss  practices  and methods) of First Bell Bancorp to those of Northwest
Bancorp (as such  practices  and methods are to be applied to First Bell Bancorp
from and after the Merger  Effective  Date) and Northwest  Bancorp's  plans with
respect to the  conduct of the  business  of First Bell  Bancorp  following  the
Merger Effective Date and otherwise to reflect Merger related expenses and costs
incurred by First Bell Bancorp; provided, however, that First Bell Bancorp shall
not be required  to take any such  action  unless  Northwest  Bancorp  agrees in
writing  that all  conditions  to closing  set forth in  Section  6.02 have been
satisfied  or  waived  (except  for the  expiration  of any  applicable  waiting
periods);  prior to the delivery by Northwest Bancorp of the writing referred to
in the preceding  clause,  First Bell Bancorp shall provide  Northwest Bancorp a
written  statement,  certified without personal liability by the chief executive
officer  of First  Bell  Bancorp  and dated the date of such  writing,  that the
representation  made  in  Section  3.15  hereof  is true  as of  such  date  or,
alternatively,  setting  forth in detail the  circumstances  that  prevent  such
representation  from being true as of such date;  and no accrual or reserve made
by  First  Bell  Bancorp  or Bell  Federal  Savings  pursuant  to  this  Section
5.10(a)(iii), or any litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out of any such
accrual  or  reserve,  shall  constitute  or be  deemed  to be a  breach  or the
occurrence  of a Material  Adverse  Effect with respect to First Bell Bancorp or
Bell Federal  Savings or violation of any  representation,  warranty,  covenant,
condition or other  provision of this  Agreement or to  constitute a termination
event within the meaning of Section 7.01(b) hereof.  No action shall be required
to be taken by

                                       43
<PAGE>

First Bell Bancorp pursuant to this Section  5.10(a)(iii) if it would contravene
applicable  law or  regulation  or,  in the  opinion  of  First  Bell  Bancorp's
independent auditors, GAAP;

                   (iv)  Stockholders'   Meeting.   Subject  to  the  terms  and
conditions of this Agreement,  First Bell Bancorp shall submit this Agreement to
its  stockholders  for approval at a meeting to be held as soon as  practicable,
and,  subject  to the next  sentence,  its Board of  Directors  shall  recommend
approval of this Agreement to the First Bell Bancorp stockholders.  The Board of
Directors  of First  Bell  Bancorp  may fail to make such a  recommendation,  or
withdraw,  modify or change any such  recommendation if such Board of Directors,
after having  consulted  with and  considered  the advice of outside  counsel to
First Bell Bancorp,  has determined that the making of such  recommendation,  or
the  failure  so to  withdraw,  modify  or  change  such  recommendation,  could
reasonably  be deemed to  constitute  a breach of the  fiduciary  duties of such
directors  under  Delaware  law,  provided  that  Section  5.06 shall govern the
withdrawal,  modification or change of such  recommendation in the circumstances
described therein. First Bell Bancorp shall take all steps necessary in order to
hold a meeting of  stockholders  for the  purpose of  approving  this  Agreement
within three (3) months of the date of this Agreement,  or as soon thereafter as
is practicable.  The Proxy Statement will not, at the time it is mailed to First
Bell Bancorp  stockholders  and up to and  including  the date of the meeting of
stockholders of First Bell Bancorp to which the Proxy Statement relates, contain
any untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit to state any  material  fact
necessary in order to make the statements  therein not  misleading;  except that
First Bell Bancorp  assumes no  responsibility  for any  statement of a material
fact,  or  failure  to  state a  material  fact  necessary  in order to make the
statements therein not misleading,  concerning  Northwest MHC, Northwest Bancorp
or Northwest  Savings Bank that is included in the Proxy  Statement  and that is
provided in writing by  Northwest  Bancorp.  First Bell  Bancorp  shall retain a
proxy solicitor in connection with the  solicitation of stockholder  approval of
this Agreement.

         (b) From and after the date of this  Agreement,  Northwest  Bancorp and
First Bell Bancorp shall each:

                   (i)  Public   Announcements.   Cooperate   and  cause   their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents to cooperate in good faith,
consistent  with their  respective  legal  obligations,  in the  preparation and
distribution  of, and agree upon the form and  substance  of, any press  release
related to this  Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  and any
other  public   disclosures   related  thereto,   including  without  limitation
communications to stockholders, internal announcements and customer disclosures,
but nothing contained herein shall prohibit any party from making any disclosure
that its counsel deems  necessary,  provided that the disclosing  party notifies
the other  party  reasonably  in  advance of the  timing  and  contents  of such
disclosure;

                   (ii) Systems  Conversions.  First Bell Bancorp and  Northwest
Bancorp shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the  conversion of
Bell  Federal  Savings  and First Bell  Bancorp's  data  processing  and related
electronic  informational  systems to those used by  Northwest  Savings Bank and
Northwest  Bancorp,  which  planning  shall  include,  but  not be  limited  to,
discussion  of the possible  termination  by First Bell  Bancorp of  third-party
service  provider  arrangements  effective at the Merger  Effective Date or at a
date thereafter,  non-renewal

                                       44
<PAGE>

of personal  property leases and software licenses used by First Bell Bancorp in
connection  with its systems  operations,  retention of outside  consultants and
additional  employees  to  assist  with  the  conversion,  and  outsourcing,  as
appropriate,   of  proprietary  or  self-provided  system  services,   it  being
understood  that  First Bell  Bancorp  shall not be  obligated  to take any such
action prior to the Merger  Effective  Date and, no conversion  shall take place
prior to the Merger  Effective Date. In the event that First Bell Bancorp takes,
at the request of Northwest  Bancorp,  any action  relative to third  parties to
facilitate the conversion that results in the imposition of any termination fees
or charges or the  incurrence  of  expenses  by First  Bell  Bancorp,  Northwest
Bancorp  shall  indemnify  First Bell  Bancorp for any such fees,  charges,  and
expenses,  as well as the costs of  reversing  the  conversion  process,  if the
Merger is not  consummated  for any reason other than a breach of this Agreement
by  First  Bell  Bancorp,  or a  termination  of this  Agreement  under  Section
7.01(c)(iv) or (d)(iii);

                   (iii)  Maintenance  of Insurance.  Maintain,  and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance in such amounts as are reasonable
to cover such risks as are  customary in relation to the  character and location
of its properties and the nature of its business;

                   (iv)  Maintenance of Books and Records.  Maintain,  and cause
their  respective  Subsidiaries  to  maintain,  books of account  and records in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with those principles used in
preparing the financial statements heretofore delivered;

                   (v) Delivery of Securities  Documents.  Deliver to the other,

required to be filed by them or their  respective  Subsidiaries on or before the
date such returns are due (including any  extensions) and pay all taxes shown to
be due on such returns on or before the date such  payment is due,  except those
being contested in good faith.

         Section  5.11.  Employee and Termination Benefits; Directors and
                         Management.

         (a) Employee Benefits. As of or after the Merger Effective Date, and at
Northwest  Bancorp's election and subject to the requirements of applicable laws
and  regulations,  the  Compensation  and  Benefit  Plans  may  continue  to  be
maintained  separately,  consolidated,  or terminated  in accordance  with their
terms.   Following  the  Merger  Effective  Date,   Northwest  Bancorp  and  its
Subsidiaries  shall honor and perform in accordance with their terms all benefit
obligations  to, and  contractual  rights of,  current and former  employees and
directors of First Bell Bancorp and its  Subsidiaries  existing as of the Merger
Effective  Date,  under  any  Compensation  and  Benefit  Plan that has not been
terminated and fully  distributed as of the Merger  Effective Date and which has
been disclosed to Northwest  Bancorp on First Bell Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedule
3.12(a),  except as otherwise provided by the Termination and Release Agreements
referred to in Section 5.11(e). If requested by Northwest Bancorp in writing not
later than ten (10) days  before the Merger  Effective  Date and  provided  that
Northwest   Bancorp  has  indicated  in  writing  that  the  conditions  to  its
obligations set forth in Section 6.02 hereof have been satisfied

                                       45
<PAGE>

or  waived,  First  Bell  Bancorp  shall  take such  steps  within  its power to
effectuate a termination of any  Compensation  and Benefit Plan as of the Merger
Effective  Date,  provided  that  the  Compensation  and  Benefit  Plan  can  be
terminated  in accordance  with its terms within such period.  In the event of a
consolidation  of any or all of such plans or in the event of termination of any
Compensation  and Benefit Plan,  employees of First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal
Savings who continue as employees of Northwest Bancorp or Northwest Savings Bank
after the Merger Effective Date ("Continuing  Employee(s)") shall be eligible to
participate  in any Northwest  Savings Bank  employee plan of similar  character
immediately  upon such  consolidation  or as of the first entry date  coincident
with or  immediately  following such  termination.  Continuing  Employees  shall
receive  credit for service with First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings for
purposes  of  determining  eligibility  and  vesting  (but not for  purposes  of
accruing or computing  benefits  under any defined  benefit  plan) under (i) any
similar existing Northwest Bancorp benefit plan except that Continuing Employees
shall be treated as new  employees  under the  Northwest  Savings Bank  Employee
Stock Ownership Plan and Northwest  Savings Bank's annual holiday bonus program,
or (ii) any new Northwest Bancorp benefit plan in which Continuing  Employees or
their  dependents  would be  eligible  to enroll,  subject  to any  pre-existing
conditions  or other  exclusions  to which such  person were  subject  under the
Compensation  and Benefit  Plans.  Such service shall also apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting  periods,  actively-at-work  requirements and evidence of
insurability  requirements.   Continuing  Employees  shall  have  no  rights  in
Northwest Savings Bank's terminated post-retirement health benefit plan.

         (b) In the event of the  termination  of any First Bell Bancorp or Bell
Federal Savings health,  disability or life insurance plan, or the consolidation
of any First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings  health,  disability  or life
insurance  plan with any  Northwest  Bancorp or  Northwest  Savings Bank health,
disability  or  life  insurance  plan,   Northwest  Bancorp  shall  as  soon  as
practicable  make  available  to  Continuing   Employees  and  their  dependents
employer-provided  health,  disability  or life  insurance  coverage on the same
basis as it  provides  such  coverage  to  employees  of  Northwest  Bancorp  or
Northwest Savings Bank. Unless a Continuing  Employee  affirmatively  terminates
coverage under a First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings  health,  disability
or life insurance plan prior to the time that such Continuing  Employee  becomes
eligible to  participate  in the  Northwest  Bancorp or  Northwest  Savings Bank
health,  disability or life insurance plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing
Employees  or their  dependents  shall  terminate  under any of the  First  Bell
Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings health, disability or life insurance plans prior
to the time such Continuing  Employees and their  dependents  become eligible to
participate  in such plans,  programs  and benefits  common to all  employees of
Northwest  Bancorp or Northwest  Savings Bank and their  dependents.  Terminated
First  Bell  Bancorp  and  Bell  Federal   Savings   employees   and   qualified
beneficiaries  will have the right to continue coverage under group health plans
of Northwest  Bancorp and/or Northwest  Bancorp  Subsidiaries in accordance with
Code Section 4980B(f). Continuing Employees who become covered under a Northwest
Bancorp or  Northwest  Savings Bank health plan shall be required to satisfy the
deductible limitations of the Northwest Bancorp or Northwest Savings Bank health
plan  for the  plan  year in which  the  coverage  commences,  with  offset  for
deductibles paid under the First Bell Bancorp or Bell

                                       46
<PAGE>

Federal  Savings  health plan, but only to the extent that either the Continuing
Employee or Bell Federal Savings  provides  substantiation  in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Northwest  Bancorp that the dollar amount of such deductible has
been paid by such  Continuing  Employee.  In the event of any termination of any
First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings health plan, or  consolidation of any
First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings  health plan with any health plan of
Northwest  Bancorp and/or Northwest Bancorp  Subsidiaries,  the Health Insurance
Portability  Accountability  Act of 1996  ("HIPAA")  will  govern  any  coverage
limitations due to pre-existing conditions.

         (c) Bell  Federal  Savings  shall  cause  contributions  under the Bell
Federal  Savings  401(k)  plan to be frozen,  effective  on or before the Merger
Effective  Date.  Continuing  Employees  shall be eligible to participate in the
Northwest Savings Bank 401(k) Plan as of the first entry date coincident with or
following  the Merger  Effective  Date.  Following  the Merger  Effective  Date,
Northwest Savings Bank shall take all action necessary to cause the Bell Federal
Savings 401(k) Plan to be merged into the Northwest Savings Bank 401(k) Plan, in
accordance with applicable tax laws.

         (d) The Bell Federal  Savings ESOP shall be terminated as of the Merger
Effective Date, all outstanding Bell Federal Savings ESOP indebtedness  shall be
repaid from the proceeds of the Merger  Consideration for the unallocated shares
of First Bell Bancorp Common Stock, and the remaining balance shall be allocated
to Bell Federal Savings  employees,  in accordance with the Bell Federal Savings
ESOP, and applicable laws and regulations as soon as practicable after the later
of  (i)  the  Merger  Effective  Date  and  (ii)  the  receipt  of  a  favorable
determination  letter for  termination of the Bell Federal Savings ESOP from the
IRS. In connection  with the  termination of the Bell Federal Savings ESOP, Bell
Federal  Savings shall promptly  apply to the IRS for a favorable  determination
letter  on the  tax-qualified  status  of  the  Bell  Federal  Savings  ESOP  on
termination  and  any  amendments  made  to the  Bell  Federal  Savings  ESOP in
connection  with its  termination  or  otherwise,  if such  amendments  have not
previously received a favorable  determination  letter from the IRS with respect
to their qualification under Code Section 401(a). Any and all distributions from
the Bell Federal  Savings ESOP after its  termination  shall be made  consistent
with the  aforementioned  determination  letter.  Prior to the Merger  Effective
Date, First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings shall make  contributions  to,
and payments on the loan of, the Bell Federal  Savings ESOP consistent with past
practices on regularly scheduled payment dates.

         (e)  Concurrently  with the execution of this  Agreement by the parties
hereto,  (i) each of Albert H.  Eckert,  II and  Jeffrey M. Hinds and First Bell
Bancorp and Bell  Federal  Savings  shall enter into a  Termination  and Release
Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto and (ii) each of Messrs.
Eckert  and  Hinds and  Northwest  Bancorp  shall  enter  into a  Noncompetition
Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto.

         (f) After the Merger  Effective Date, any former employee of First Bell
Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings  whose  employment  is actually  terminated  by
Northwest Bancorp within six (6) months of the Merger Effective Date, other than
the  employees  receiving  severance  benefits  pursuant to existing  employment
agreements, change in control agreements or severance agreements, shall receive,
upon  termination  of employment,  a payment from  Northwest  Savings Bank in an
amount  equal to two (2) weeks  salary for each year of service  with First Bell
Bancorp or Bell Federal Savings,  with a minimum of four (4) weeks of salary and
a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of salary, as well as health benefit coverage
substantially  similar to the coverage received by such person immediately prior
to termination of employment in accordance with

                                       47
<PAGE>

Code  Section  4980B(f).  Northwest  Savings  Bank shall  provide  out-placement
services to terminated  employees of First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings
consistent with past practices of Northwest Bancorp and Northwest Savings Bank.

         (g) Each  person  who  serves on the Board of  Directors  of First Bell
Bancorp  or Bell  Federal  Savings  both  on the  date  of  this  Agreement  and
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Date shall be offered a position as an
advisory  director on Northwest  Savings Bank's  Allegheny County Advisory Board
immediately  following the Merger  Effective  Date. For service on such advisory
board for the first  year  following  the  Merger  Effective  Date,  the  former
directors  of First Bell  Bancorp or Bell  Federal  Savings  shall each  receive
$1,250 per month  (which is equal to the annual rate paid to such  directors  by
First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal  Savings as of the date of this  Agreement).
After one year,  fees paid to former  directors  of First  Bell  Bancorp or Bell
Federal  Savings  shall be  modified  to conform  to  Northwest  Savings  Bank's
advisory board fee schedule.

         (h) Prior to the Merger  Effective Date,  First Bell Bancorp shall take
all actions  necessary to terminate the First Bell Bancorp Stock Option Plan and
Bell Federal Savings Restricted Stock Plan, effective as of the Merger Effective
Date.

         (i) First Bell Bancorp Disclosure  Schedule 3.18 sets forth the accrued
but unpaid  vacation  pay for  employees  of First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal
Savings  as  of  February  28,  2003.  Upon  Northwest   Savings  Bank's  actual
termination  prior to December  31, 2003 of any Bell  Federal  Savings  employee
identified in Schedule 3.18 for whom vacation pay was accrued and expensed based
on employment  in or before 2002 with Bell Federal  Savings or for whom vacation
pay was accrued during 2003 prior to the Merger  Effective  Date,  such employee
shall be entitled to payment of any such accrued and expensed  vacation pay. Any
Continuing  Employee will be entitled to any such unused  vacation  during 2003,
provided, however if such Continuing Employee does not use such accrued vacation
on or prior to December 31, 2003,  such accrued but unused vacation pay shall be
paid to such Continuing Employee as of December 31, 2003.

         Section  5.12.  Duty to  Advise;  Duty to  Update  Northwest  Bancorp's
Disclosure Schedules. Northwest Bancorp shall promptly advise First Bell Bancorp
of any  change  or  event  having  a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on it or on any
Northwest  Bancorp  Subsidiary or that it believes  would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material  breach of any of its  representations,
warranties  or covenants set forth  herein.  Northwest  Bancorp shall update the
Northwest  Bancorp  Disclosure  Schedules as promptly as  practicable  after the
occurrence of an event or fact that, if such event or fact had occurred prior to
the date of this Agreement,  would have been disclosed in the Northwest  Bancorp
Disclosure  Schedule.  The delivery of such updated  Schedules shall not relieve
Northwest  Bancorp from any breach or violation of this  Agreement and shall not
have  any  effect  for the  purposes  of  determining  the  satisfaction  of the
condition set forth in Section 6.01(c) hereof.

         Section 5.13.  Bank and Related Merger Transactions.

         (a) As  soon  as  practicable  following  the  Merger  Effective  Date,
Northwest Bancorp shall, and it shall cause First Bell Bancorp (as the Surviving
Corporation  in the Merger) to, effect the Company  Merger by executing a merger
agreement and filing a certificate  of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware  pursuant to the DGCL,  and articles of  combination  with the

Merger, the separate  corporate  existence of First Bell Bancorp shall cease and
Northwest Bancorp shall be the surviving  corporation and continue its corporate

         (b) As soon as practicable after consummation of the Merger,  Northwest
Savings  Bank and Bell  Federal  Savings  shall take all actions  necessary  and

corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Bancorp, its majority-owned  subsidiary,  to perform its obligations  hereunder,
and Northwest MHC and Northwest Bancorp shall be jointly and severally obligated
and  liable for all of the  agreements  and  obligations  of  Northwest  Bancorp
hereunder.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that First Bell Bancorp and
Bell  Federal  Savings,  as well as any party  seeking to enforce  rights  under
Section 5.05 or Sections  5.11(e),  (f) or (g) hereof,  may pursue Northwest MHC
for the payment or  enforcement  of any  obligation  or  liability  of Northwest
Bancorp hereunder or thereunder without pursuing or exhausting  remedies against
Northwest Bancorp or Northwest  Savings Bank or prior  notification to either of
the same and without regard to any regulatory  restrictions which are applicable
to Northwest Bancorp or Northwest Savings Bank but not to Northwest MHC.

any  extension  or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an  instrument  in
writing signed by a duly  authorized  officer on behalf of such party,  but such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement  or  condition  shall not  operate  as a waiver of, or  estoppel  with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Lincoln Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15202.

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS,  Northwest Bancorp,  MHC, Northwest Bancorp,  Inc. ("Northwest
Bancorp"),   Northwest  Savings  Bank  and  Northwest  Merger  Subsidiary,  Inc.
(collectively  referred  to as  "Northwest")  and First  Bell  Bancorp  and Bell
Federal  Savings  (collectively  referred to as "Bell")  have  entered into that
certain  Agreement  and Plan of  Merger,  dated  March  11,  2003  (the  "Merger
Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS,  Section 5.11(f) of the Merger  Agreement  provides that First
Bell  Bancorp,  Bell  Federal  Savings and the  Executive  shall enter into this
Agreement which shall terminate the Employment  Agreement  between Executive and
Bell Federal Savings,  dated November 16, 1998 (the "Bank Employment Agreement")
and between  Executive  and First Bell  Bancorp,  dated  November  16, 1998 (the
"Bancorp Employment Agreement")  (collectively,  the "Employment Agreements") as
of the Merger  Effective Date, and in lieu of any rights and payments under said
Employment  Agreements,  Executive  shall be entitled to the rights and payments
set forth herein.

         NOW  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the foregoing and other good and
valuable   consideration   the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  is  hereby
acknowledged,  the Executive,  First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings agree
as follows:

         1. Acknowledgement of Payment, Release and Waiver.

         (a) In  consideration  of the payment by Bell  Federal  Savings  and/or
First Bell Bancorp to the  Executive of  $_____________1  (subject to applicable
withholding  taxes) on the Merger  Effective  Date,  the  Executive,  First Bell
Bancorp  and Bell  Federal  Savings  hereby  agree  that,  except as provided in
Section 2(a) below, the Employment  Agreements  shall be terminated  without any
further action of any parties hereto,  effective immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Date.

         (b) If the payment  pursuant to Section  1(a)  hereof,  either alone or
together with other  payments and benefits  which the Executive has the right to
receive from First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings (but excluding  amounts
payable pursuant to the Noncompetition Agreement and the Consulting Agreement as
defined below), would constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the
Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),  the payment payable by
First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings  pursuant to Section  (1)(a)  hereof
shall be reduced by the amount  which is the minimum  necessary  to result in no
portion of the payment  payable by First Bell Bancorp and Bell  Federal  Savings
under Section(1)(a) being

--------------------
1.  $1,480,000 and $665,000 in the case of Messrs. Eckert and Hinds,

<PAGE>

non-deductible to First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings (or any successors
thereto)  pursuant  to  Section  280G of the Code and  subject to the excise tax
imposed  under  Section  4999 of the Code.  The  parties  hereto  agree that the
present value of the payments and benefits payable pursuant to this Agreement to
the Executive upon termination of the Executive's employment pursuant to Section
(1)(a) shall be limited to three times the  Executive's  "base  amount," as that
term is  defined  in  Section  280G(b)(3)  of the  Code,  less one  dollar.  The
determination  of any  reduction  in the payment to be made  pursuant to Section
(1)(a)  shall be based  upon an  analysis  prepared  by Elias,  Matz,  Tiernan &
Herrick  L.L.P.  ("EMTH") and paid for by First Bell Bancorp.  EMTH shall update
the analysis which it has  previously  prepared in this regard no later than ten
(10) days prior to the Merger  Effective  Date, and may use such actuaries as it
may deem necessary or advisable for the purpose.

         2. Releases.

         (a) Except as noted in the next  succeeding  sentence,  upon payment of
the amount set forth in Section 1(a) hereof, the Executive,  for himself and for
his heirs,  successors and assigns,  does hereby release  completely and forever
discharge First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings from any obligation  under
the Employment  Agreements,  provided that,  notwithstanding the foregoing,  the
Executive  does not hereby  release  First Bell Bancorp or Bell Federal  Savings
from any obligation to the Executive  under Section 6 of the Bancorp  Employment
Agreement  (as amended  below),  which the parties  hereto agree shall remain in
full force and  effect,  or any  obligation  which  First  Bell  Bancorp or Bell
Federal Saving may have to the Executive under any Compensation and Benefit Plan
or otherwise.

         (b) For and in  consideration  of the  commitments  made  herein by the
Executive,  each of First Bell Bancorp and Bell Federal Savings, for itself, and
for its  successors  and assigns,  does hereby  release  completely  and forever
discharge the Executive and his heirs,  successors  and assigns,  to the fullest
extent  permitted by applicable  law, from any  obligation  under the Employment
Agreements, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, First Bell Bancorp and
Bell Federal  Savings do not hereby  release the Executive  from any  obligation
under paragraph (c) of Section 6 of the Bancorp Employment Agreement (as amended
below).

         3.  Amendment  to the Bancorp  Employment  Agreement.  Section 6 of the
Bancorp Employment Agreement is hereby amended by (i) deleting the phrase "shall
be made by Deloitte & Touche or such successor  thereto (the "Accounting  Firm")
and substituting  therefor the phrase "shall be made by Elias,  Matz,  Tiernan &
Herrick  L.L.P.  (the "Law Firm")" and (ii) changing all  references  therein to
"the Accounting Firm" to "the Law Firm."

         4. General.

         (a) Heirs, Successors and Assigns. The terms of this Agreement shall be
binding  upon the parties  hereto and their  respective  heirs,  successors  and
assigns.

         (b) Final Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire understanding
of the parties with respect to the subject  matter  thereof and  supersedes  all
prior  understandings,  written  or oral.  The  terms of this  Agreement  may be
changed,  modified or discharged only by an instrument in writing signed by each

         (c) Governing  Law.  This  Agreement  shall be construed,  enforced and
interpreted in accordance  with and governed by the laws of the  Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, without reference to its principles of conflicts of law, except to
the extent that Federal law shall be deemed to preempt such state laws.

         (d) Defined Terms. Any capitalized  terms not defined in this Agreement
shall have as their meaning the definitions contained in the Merger Agreement.

         (e) Voluntary Action and Waiver. The Executive acknowledges that by his
free and voluntary  act of signing  below,  the  Executive  agrees to all of the
terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally bound  thereby.  The Executive
acknowledges  that he has been  advised to  consult  with an  attorney  prior to
executing this Agreement.

         5.  Effectiveness.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained
herein,  this  Agreement  shall be  subject  to  consummation  of the  Merger in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended by
the parties thereto in accordance with its terms.

                                    RECITALS:

         WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March

         WHEREAS,  the parties hereto  recognize and acknowledge the interest of
Northwest  Savings Bank and  Northwest  Bancorp in  protecting  the business and
goodwill  associated  with Bell  Federal  Savings  and  Northwest  Savings  Bank
following the Mergers by having Executive enter into this Agreement.

         NOW THEREFORE,  in consideration  of the foregoing,  and for other good
and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt and  sufficiency  of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. Any  capitalized  terms not defined in this Agreement  shall have as
their meanings the definitions contained in the Merger Agreement.

         2. The Executive  agrees that during the one-year period  following the

solicit  or induce,  or cause  others to solicit  or  induce,  any  employee  of
Northwest  Bancorp or any of its  subsidiaries  to leave the  employment of such

<PAGE>

         3. In consideration of the obligations and commitments of the Executive
under this  Agreement,  Northwest  Bancorp  shall pay to the Executive an amount

concerning the records, properties, books, contracts, commitments and affairs of
Northwest  Bancorp and/or its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates,  including but not
limited to, information regarding accounts, shareholders,  finances, strategies,

         5. The term of this  Agreement  shall  expire  one (1) year  after  the

         8. It is the  intention of the parties  hereto that the  provisions  of
this  Agreement  shall be enforced to the fullest extent  permissible  under all
applicable  laws and  public  policies,  but that  the  unenforceability  or the
modification  to  conform  with such laws or public  policies  of any  provision
hereof shall not render  unenforceable or impair the remainder of the Agreement.
The  covenants  in  Section  2 of this  Agreement  with  respect  to  Allegheny,
Armstrong,  Beaver, Butler, Washington and Westmoreland Counties shall be deemed
