3.5 _Determination of Closing Working Capital_

 

 

(a) Within 120 days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare or
cause to be prepared, at the Purchaser's sole expense, and deliver to the
Sellers' Representative a calculation  of Working Capital as at the Effective
Time on the Closing Date, prepared in accordance with the principles,
policies, categorizations, definitions, methods, practices, judgments,
classifications, estimation methodologies and techniques (the "Working Capital
Principles") set out in Exhibit 3.5(a). For illustration purposes, an example
of such Working Capital calculation is also included in Exhibit 3.5(a).

 

 

(b) Following receipt of the calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the
Sellers' Representative will have 45 days to review such calculation (the
"Review Period").

 

 

(c) Each Party shall be responsible for its own fees and expenses, including
the fees and expenses of its accounting advisors, in preparing or reviewing,
as the case may be, the calculation  of the Closing Working Capital. If a
dispute regarding the calculation of the Closing Working Capital is submitted
for determination to the Independent Accountant under Section 3.6, the fees
and expenses of the Parties and the Independent  Accountant will be paid in
accordance with Section 3.6.

 

 

(d) If, in connection with the calculation of the Closing Working Capital by
the Purchaser as contemplated in Section 3.5(a), the Purchaser reasonably
interprets the accounting policies,  practices, principles, methods and
estimation techniques (including in respect of the exercise of management
judgement) as actually applied in the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements for the year ended April 30, 2018 as being  inconsistent with GAAP
(the "Purchaser GAAP Interpretation"), then the Sellers' Target Working
Capital shall also be recalculated to reflect the Purchaser GAAP 
Interpretation.

 

 

3.6 _Acceptance or Dispute of the Closing Working Capital_

 

 

(a) Following receipt of the calculation of the Closing Working Capital as
contemplated by Section 3.5, if the Sellers' Representative objects in good
faith to the calculation of the Closing  Working Capital or the Purchaser
GAAP Interpretation, the Sellers' Representative shall so notify the Purchaser
by delivering to the Purchaser a written notice to that effect (the "Notice of
Objection") prior to the end of the Review Period. The Notice of Objection
must set out in reasonable detail (i) any item of the Closing Working Capital
which the Sellers' Representative believes has not been prepared in 
accordance with this Agreement and the correct amount of such item, (ii) the
reasons for the Sellers' Representative objection in respect of each such
item, and (iii) the Sellers' Representative's alternative calculation of the
Closing Working  Capital as prepared in accordance with the Working Capital
Principles. Any

 

  -25-

 

 

item or amount to which no objection is raised in the Notice of Objection will
be final and binding on the Parties on the last day of  the Review Period. If
the Sellers' Representative does not object to the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital, the Sellers' Representative may so notify the Purchaser by
delivering a written notice to that effect (the "Notice of Acceptance"). If
the Sellers' Representative does not deliver a Notice of Objection or Notice
of Acceptance to the Purchaser prior to the end of the Review Period, the
Sellers'  Representative will be deemed to have delivered a Notice of
Acceptance to the Purchaser on the last day of the Review Period and the
Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Working Capital will be deemed to be
final and binding for purposes of the  adjustments referred to in Section
3.7.

 

 

(b) If the Sellers' Representative delivers a Notice of Objection in
accordance with Section 3.6(a), the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser
shall work expeditiously and in good faith  to resolve all of the items in
dispute set out in the Notice of Objection within 30 days following delivery
of the Notice of Objection. Any items in dispute as set out in the Notice of
Objection that are not resolved by the end of that 30-day  period will be
submitted in writing by the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser for
determination to XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX   or such other
independent accounting firm mutually agreed to by the Sellers' Representative
and the Purchaser (the "Independent Accountant"). In making its
determination,  the Independent Accountant will act as expert and not as
arbitrator, must only consider the items in dispute submitted to it in writing
in accordance with the preceding sentence, and must make reasonable efforts to
determine the items in dispute  within 30 Business Days following the date of
appointment. In any such case, a single partner of the Independent Accountant
selected by the Independent Accountant in accordance with its normal
procedures and having expertise with respect to  settlement of such
objections shall act for the Independent Accountant in the determination
proceeding, and the Independent Accountant shall render a written decision as
to each objected matter, including a statement in reasonable detail of the 
basis for its decision. In resolving each such item in the Notice of
Objection, the Independent Accountant (i) shall resolve such matter in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and (ii) may not assign a
value to any item greater than  the greatest value for such item claimed by
either the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either the Purchaser or the Sellers'
Representative. The Purchaser and the Sellers'  Representative shall make
available to the Independent Accountant the books and records and relevant
personnel, as well as any documents or work papers used in the preparation of
the items in Section 3.5(a) and the Notice of Objection, and all  other items
reasonably requested by the Independent Accountant. Each of the Parties agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Independent
Accountant (including by executing a customary engagement letter reasonably 
acceptable to it) and to cause the Independent Accountant to resolve any such
dispute as soon as practicable but in no event later than 30 Business Days
after the commencement of the Independent Accountant's engagement.

 

 

(c) The determination of the Independent Accountant will be final and binding
on the Parties and will not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error, and
the Closing Working Capital as  determined by the Independent Accountant will
be final and binding for purposes of the adjustments referred to in Section
3.7.

 

 

(d) The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne
equally by the Sellers on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand.
Any fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant to be paid by the 
Sellers, shall, at the option of the Purchaser, be paid from the Working
Capital Escrow Amount. The Purchaser, the Sellers' Representative and the
Sellers shall each bear their own costs in presenting their respective cases
to the Independent  Accountant. The Purchaser, the Sellers' Representative
and the

Sellers shall each bear their own costs in presenting their respective cases
to the Independent Accountant.

harmless the Purchaser, its officers, directors, employees and controlling
persons for any  provincial Sales Tax, penalties and interest payable or

under any such insurance policies, nor be obliged to renew or  extend any
existing policies that terminate by their terms after Closing, provided that
the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with notice of any such payment or
obligation as soon as practicable after the Sellers become aware thereof so
that the  Purchaser may take steps to discharge such payment or obligation.
The Sellers acknowledge the right of the Purchaser for access to the benefit
of such insurance for such pre-Closing occurrences. Following the Closing, at
the cost of the Purchaser,  the Seller shall cooperate with and assist

ARTICLE 7 
  _TAX MATTERS_

 

 

7.1 _Preparation of Tax Returns_

 

 

(a) Tax Return Preparation. The Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and filed
on a timely basis all Tax Returns  for the Purchased Entity for (i) any Pre-
Closing Tax Period for which Tax Returns have not been filed as of the Closing
Date and (ii) for any Straddle Period for which Tax Returns are required to be
prepared and filed (all such Tax Returns referred  to in clause (i) and (ii)
of this Section 7.1(a) being referred to herein as the "Stub Period Returns").
The Purchaser shall prepare each such Stub Period Return on a  basis
consistent with (x) applicable Law and (y) the past practices and procedures
of the Purchased Entity, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any
Stub Period Return, the Purchased Entity shall not deduct any amount in the
nature of a  reserve or claim any Tax credit that would require the Purchased
Entity to include in a taxable period ending after the Time of Closing any
amount of income, unless the Tax liability in respect of such income
(determined as though such income were  the only income or loss of the entity
for the tax period and without regard for the availability of any loss
carryforwards or carrybacks) is taken into account in computing the Closing
Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser may  cause the
Purchased Entity to make an election pursuant to subsection 256(9) of the Tax
Act in respect of the taxation year of the Purchased Entity, as the case may
be, ending on the acquisition of control of it by the Purchaser. The
Purchaser  shall provide to the Sellers' Representative for its review a
draft of each Stub Period Return no later than 30 days in the case of an
income Tax Return, and 10 days in the case of any other Tax Return, prior to
the due date for filing such Tax  Return with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities. The Sellers' Representative shall notify the Purchaser in writing
within 15 days in the case of an income Tax Return, and 5 days in the case of
any other Tax Return, after delivery of a Stub  Period Return if it has any
reasonable comments with respect to items set forth in such Stub Period
Return. The Purchaser shall consider in good faith all such comments.

 

  -62-

 

 


 

 

(b) Payment of Pre-Closing Taxes. Other than Taxes which were specifically
taken into account in computing the  Closing Working Capital, MSR shall pay
(i) all Taxes due with respect to all Tax Returns for the Purchased Entity for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) with respect to all Tax Returns for the
Purchased Entity for any Straddle Period, Taxes  allocable to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Closing Date (as
determined under Section 7.1(c)).

 

 

(c) Straddle Periods. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes
allocable to the portion of the  Straddle Period ending immediately prior to
the Closing Date shall be:

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal
property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such  Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period prior to the
Closing Date and  the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire relevant Straddle Period; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

In the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) above (such as
franchise Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts,
or Taxes that are  based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property), the amount of any such
Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

7.2 _Tax Contests_

 

 

If a Purchaser's Indemnified Party receives any written proposal to assess or
reassess, assessment, reassessment,  appeal or notification of similar
Proceeding (each, a "Tax Notice") with respect to any Tax in respect of which
a claim may be made for indemnification under this  Agreement (an
"Indemnified Tax"), such Purchaser's Indemnified Party shall promptly (but in
any event within 10 Business Days of receipt) deliver a copy of the Tax
Notice  to the Sellers' Representative, together with all correspondence
relating to, and any other documents received in respect of, such Tax Notice.
The failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Sellers of the Tax
indemnification obligations  provided hereunder except to the extent that
such failure materially affects the Sellers' ability to defend such claim or
respond in a timely manner, or in any way materially prejudices the Sellers.
The foregoing notwithstanding, the Purchaser may  not settle any Tax audit or
other Tax contest for Indemnified Taxes without the prior written consent of
the Sellers' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. For greater certainty, the right to  control,
participate and settle any Tax audit or other Tax contest shall be subject to
Section 10.10.

 

 

7.3 _Tax Indemnification Events_

 

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the following
provisions shall apply in respect of any  claims for Indemnified Taxes:

 

 

(a) Initial Tax Payments. In the case of a Tax Notice that is a notice of
assessment or reassessment, a notice of  confirmation of an assessment or
reassessment, a notice of garnishment, or a similar document in respect of any
Indemnified Taxes, the Sellers shall, within

 

  -63-

 

 


 

 

15 days of receipt of written notice of such claim (whether by the Sellers or
the Sellers' Representative), reimburse the applicable  Purchaser's
Indemnified Party for an amount equal to (a) the full amount of such
Indemnified Taxes in respect of which a Governmental Authority has taken or
has given notice in writing of an intention to take collection action, or (b)
the full  amount that has been garnished and applied towards any Indemnified
Taxes, as applicable.

 

 

(b) Final Determination True-Up. Upon the occurrence of a Tax Indemnification
Event, (i) to the extent that the  total of the amounts previously paid by
the Sellers in respect of the relevant Indemnified Taxes is less than the
amount so determined to be the amount of the Indemnified Taxes, the Sellers
shall forthwith (and, in any event, within fifteen days of  the time that the
applicable Purchaser's Indemnified Party notifies the Sellers' Representative
of the occurrence of the Tax Indemnification Event) pay to such Purchaser's
Indemnified Party the amount of the Indemnified Taxes less the total of the 
amounts previously paid, and (ii) to the extent that the total of the amounts
previously paid by the Sellers in respect of such Indemnified Taxes exceeds
the amount so determined to be the amount of the Indemnified Taxes, such
Purchaser's  Indemnified Party shall forthwith upon receipt or confirmation
of any refund or credit of such Indemnified Taxes (and, in any event, within
15 days of the receipt or confirmation of such refund or credit) pay to the
Sellers the amount of such  refund or credit (including any interest paid or
credited with respect thereto but net of any Taxes payable by the Purchaser's
Indemnified Party in respect of such refund, credit or interest).

 

 

7.4 _Tax Cooperation_

 

 

Each Party shall provide reasonable cooperation to the other Party and its
counsel in respect of Tax matters,  including:

 

 

(a) making available to each other in a timely fashion such data, documents
and other information as may reasonably be required for the preparation and
filing of all Stub Period Returns, or  for the conduct of any Tax contest,
and preserving all such data, documents and information until the expiry of
the limitation period under applicable Law with respect to the taxation years
or periods covered by such Stub Period Returns, or until a  Final
Determination has been made in respect of such Tax contest, as the case may
be; and

 

 

(b) timely signing and delivering such certificates or forms as may be
necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce)
Taxes, or an exemption from (or an  extension in respect of) an obligation to
file Tax Returns.

 

 

7.5 _Elections and Covenants_

 

 

(a) Excessive Eligible Dividend Designation Election. If it is determined that
the Purchased Entity made an  "excessive eligible dividend designation" (as
defined in subsection 89(1) of the Tax Act), the Sellers hereby concur (or
shall cause the recipient of the relevant dividend to concur) in the making of
an election under subsection 185.1(2) of the Tax  Act in respect of the full
amount thereof, and such election shall be made by the Purchased Entity, as
the case may be, in the manner and within the time prescribed by subsections
185.1(2) and 185.1(3) of the Tax Act.

 

 

(b) Excessive Capital Dividend Election. If it is determined that the
Purchased Entity made an election under  subsection 83(2) of the Tax Act in
respect of the full amount of any dividend payable by it on shares of any
class of its capital stock and the full amount of such dividend exceeded the
amount of the Purchased Entity's "capital dividend account"  (as defined

 

  -64-

 

 


 

 

 

in the Tax Act) immediately before the dividend became payable, the Sellers
hereby concur (or shall cause the recipient of the  relevant dividend to
concur) in the making of an election under subsection 184(3) of the Tax Act in
respect of such dividend.

10.5 _Claim Notice_

 

 

If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any act, omission or state of facts
that may give rise to Damages in  respect of which a right of indemnification
is provided for under this Article 10, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
give written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice") to  the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , that Sellers' Representative shall give or receive such notices
on behalf of any Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable. The Claim Notice
shall  specify whether the potential Damages arise as a result of a claim by
a Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") or whether the
potential Damages arise  as a result of a claim directly by the Indemnified
Party against the Indemnifying Party (a "Direct Claim"), and shall also
specify with reasonable particularity (to the  extent that the information is
available):

 

 

 

       
    | (a)  |  

the factual basis for the Direct Claim or Third Party Claim, as the case may
be; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

the amount of the potential Damages arising therefrom, if known.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

If, through the fault of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party (or the
Sellers' Representative, as the case may be) does not  receive a Claim Notice
in time effectively to contest the determination of any liability susceptible
of being contested or to assert a right to recover an amount under applicable
insurance coverage, then the liability of the Indemnifying Party to  the
Indemnified Party under this Article 10 shall be reduced only to the extent
that Damages are actually incurred by the Indemnifying Party resulting from
the Indemnified Party's failure to give the Claim Notice on a timely basis.
Nothing in this  Section 10.5 shall be construed to affect the time within
which a Claim Notice must be delivered pursuant to Sections 10.6(a) and
10.6(b) in order to permit recovery pursuant to Section 10.3(a) or 10.4(a) as
the case may be.

 

 

10.6 _Time Limits for Delivery of Claim Notice_

 

 

(a) Notice by the Purchaser. No Damages may be recovered from the Sellers 
pursuant to Section 10.3 unless (subject to the fraud and wilful misconduct
exceptions below) a Claim Notice is delivered by the Purchaser in accordance
with the timing set out below:

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

with respect to all breaches of Section 10.3(a) other than pertaining to the
Seller Fundamental Representations and the Tax Representations, _XXX XXX XXX
XXX XXX XXX_

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

with respect to all breaches of Section 10.3(a) pertaining to the Seller
Fundamental Representations, _XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (iii)  |  

with respect to all breaches of Section 10.3(a) pertaining to the Tax
Representations, and with respect to any claim under Section 10.3(c), until
_XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_ _XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX __XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_
_XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX __XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_ _XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX _

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

  -72-

 

 


 

 

provided, however, that in the event of fraud or wilful misconduct of the
Sellers, then notwithstanding the foregoing time  limitations, the
Purchaser's Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to deliver a Claim Notice at
any time for purposes of such a claim. This Section 10.6(a) shall not be
construed to impose any time limit on the Purchaser's right to assert a
claim  to recover Damages under Section 10.3(b) and Section 10.3(d) whether
or not the basis on which such a claim is asserted could also entitle the
Purchaser to make a claim for Damages pursuant to Section 10.3(a).

 

 

(b) Notice by the Sellers. No Damages may be recovered from the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 10.4(a) unless a  Claim Notice is delivered by the
Sellers' Representative on or before _XXX XXX XXX XXX      XXX XXX_ 
provided, however, that in the event of fraud of the Purchaser, then
notwithstanding the foregoing time limitations, the Sellers' Representative
shall be entitled to deliver a Claim Notice at any  time for purposes of such
a claim. This Section 10.6(b) shall not be construed to impose any time limit
on the Sellers' right to assert a claim to recover Damages under Section
10.4(b), 10.4(c), or 10.4(d) whether or not the basis on which such a  claim
is asserted could also entitle the Seller to make a claim for Damages pursuant
to Section 10.4(a).

 

 

(c) In the event that written notice of any bona fide claim for
indemnification under this Article 10 shall have been given in accordance with
this Agreement within the applicable period  specified in this Section 10.6,
the rights and obligations that are the subject of such claim for
indemnification shall survive with respect to such claim until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

 

10.7 _Monetary Limitations_

 

 

(a) The Sellers shall not be liable for any amounts for which the Purchaser's
Indemnified Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification  pursuant to
Sections 10.3(a) or 10.3(c) unless the aggregate amount of all Damages for
which the Purchaser's Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
exceeds _XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_ _XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_ (the "Purchase
Agreement Deductible") _XXX   XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_ _XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_
_XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX_ For greater certainty and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing part of this Section 10.7: (x) _XXX   XXX XXX

XXX XXX XXX XXX___ _ _ _ _XXX     XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX____ _ _ _ _ _XXX XXX

XXX XXX XXX XXX__ _ _ _XXX     XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX___ _ _ _ _XXX     XXX
XXX XXX XXX XXX____  _provided_ , _further_ , that this Section 10.7(a) shall
not apply to claims for Damages suffered, incurred or realized by, imposed
upon or asserted against any of the Purchaser's Indemnified Parties based on 
fraud or wilful misconduct of a Seller.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
any lower limitations set forth herein, (i) except in the case of fraud or
wilful misconduct of a Seller, the  maximum aggregate liability of the
Sellers pursuant to Sections 10.3(a) and 10.3(c) shall not exceed _XXX XXX XXX
XXX      XXX XXX_  and (ii) the maximum aggregate liability of the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed _XXX   XXX XXX XXX XXX
XXX_.  The maximum aggregate liability of the Purchaser pursuant to Section
10.4 shall not exceed _XXX   XXX XXX _

 

  -73-

 

 


 

 

(c)  _XXX XXX XXX ___XXX   XXX XXX _____XXX     XXX XXX ___  the
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall execute and deliver a joint
direction to the Escrow Agent authorizing the Escrow Agent to release whatever
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount  was not previously and is not then
subject to a claim for Damages in accordance with the terms of this Article 10
to an account or accounts designated by the Sellers' Representative in
writing.

 

 

10.8 _Limitation Periods_

 

 

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Limitations      Act, 2002
(Ontario) or any other statute, a proceeding or arbitration in respect of a
claim for indemnification or otherwise arising from any breach or inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty in this Agreement shall be commenced on  or
before the second anniversary of the date on which the Party making the
representation or warranty was notified by the Indemnified Party of the claim,
so long as the Party was notified of the claim prior to the end of the time
period specified  in Section 10.6. Any applicable limitation period is
extended or varied to the full extent permitted by Law to give effect to this
Section 10.8.

 

 

10.9 _Direct Claims_

 

 

In the case of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 60 days from
receipt of a Claim Notice in respect  thereof within which to make such
investigation as the Indemnifying Party considers necessary or desirable. For
the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall make available
to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by  the Indemnified
Party to substantiate its right to be indemnified under this Article 10,
together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. If the Parties fail to agree at or before the expiration
of such 60  day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the
Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
it.

 

 

10.10 _Third Party Claims_

 

 

(a) Rights of Indemnifying Party. In the event a Claim Notice is delivered 
with respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party (in the case of a
Seller Indemnified Party, the Sellers' Representative on its behalf) shall
have the right, at its expense, to participate in but not control the
negotiation, settlement  or defence of the Third Party Claim, which control
shall rest at all times with the Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying
Party (in the case of an Indemnifying Party that is a Seller, the Sellers'
Representative on its behalf):

 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

irrevocably and unconditionally acknowledges in writing complete
responsibility for, and agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect
of all Damages relating  to, the Third Party Claim; and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

furnishes evidence to the Indemnified Party whenever requested by the
Indemnified Party, which is satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, acting
reasonably, of the  Indemnifying Party's financial ability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

in which case the Indemnifying Party (or the Sellers' Representative, as
applicable) may assume such control at its expense through  counsel of its
choice; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be permitted to assume control of the
negotiation, settlement or defence of the Third Party Claim if: (A) such Third
Party Claim

 

  -74-

 

 


 

 

 

seeks equitable relief against the Indemnified Party as a primary form of
relief; (B) such Third Party Claim involves criminal  liability; or (C) such
Third Party Claim is by a current material customer or supplier of the
Purchased Business, the Purchaser or its Affiliates, or (D) the Third Party
Claims could reasonably result in Damages in excess of, the Indemnifying 
Party's maximum remaining indemnification obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Respective Rights on Indemnifying Party's Assumption of Control. If the
Indemnifying Party (or, in the case  of an Indemnifying Party that is a
Seller, the Sellers' Representative) elects to assume control as contemplated
in Section 10.10(a), the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified
Party for all of the Indemnified Party's out-of-pocket  expenses incurred as
a result of such assumption. The Indemnified Party shall continue to have the
right to participate in the negotiation, settlement or defence of such Third
Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, provided that  the
fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party
unless the Indemnifying Party (or the Sellers' Representative, as applicable)
consents to the retention of such counsel at its expense or unless the named
parties to  any action or proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party and a representation of both the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the
actual or potential differing  interests between them (such as the
availability of different defences), in which case the fees and disbursements
of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party
shall co-operate with the Indemnifying Party so as to  permit the
Indemnifying Party to conduct such negotiation, settlement and defence and for
this purpose shall preserve all relevant documents in relation to the Third
Party Claim, allow the Indemnifying Party access on reasonable notice to
inspect  and take copies of all such documents and require its personnel to
provide such statements as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require and
to attend and give evidence at any trial or hearing in respect of the Third
Party Claim.

 

 

(c) Lack of Reasonable Diligence. If, having elected to assume control as
contemplated by Section 10.10(a), the  Indemnifying Party thereafter fails to
conduct the negotiation, settlement or defence of the relevant Third Party
Claim with reasonable diligence, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to assume such control and the Indemnifying Party shall  be bound by the
results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim.

 

 

(d) Other Rights of Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or
is not permitted to, assume  control of the defence of any Third Party Claim
pursuant to Section 10.10(a), the Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive
right to contest, settle or pay the amount claimed and the Indemnifying Party
shall be bound by the results obtained by the  Indemnified Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of the negotiation, settlement or defence of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim  without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

10.11 _Calculation of Damages_

 

 

For purposes of this Article 10, any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty or Damages calculated  in respect of such breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty shall be determined without
regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or 
warranty, except with respect to Section 4.33(d).

 

  -75-

 

 


 

 

10.12 _Insurance Policies and Tax Benefits and Detriments_

 

 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Damages
of all Indemnified Parties shall be  net of any insurance, or other prior or
subsequent recoveries actually received (including under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement agreement or Contract pursuant to
which or under which any Indemnified Party is a party  or has rights, but
excluding any recoveries received under the RandW Insurance Policy on the basis
that the Sellers are not liable for such amounts) by the Indemnified Parties
in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of  indemnification,
but shall include an increase in insurance premiums. The amount of any Damages
that an Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover will be (i) reduced by
any net Tax benefits actually realized by such Indemnified Party in the  year
of the payment in respect of the Damages as a result of the deductibility of
such payment, and (ii) increased by any net Tax detriment actually incurred by
such Indemnified Party in the year of payment resulting from such Damages.

 

 

10.13 _Mitigation_

 

 

Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or
liability that such Indemnified Party  asserts or is reasonably likely to
assert under this Article 10. In the event that any Indemnified Party shall
fail to make such reasonable efforts to mitigate any such claim or liability,
then notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement  to the contrary,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for that portion of any Damages that the Indemnifying Party can
demonstrate would have been avoided if the Indemnified Party had made such
efforts.

 

 

10.14 _No Double Recovery_

 

 

No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from any Indemnifying Party
under this Article 10 or under any  other agreement delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, more than once in respect of the same Damages to the extent
recovered (notwithstanding that such Damages may result from breaches of
multiple provisions of this Agreement and/or other agreements  delivered
pursuant to this Agreement). For greater certainty, no Damages may be claimed
under this Article 10 by any Indemnified Party to the extent such amounts are
otherwise taken into account in calculating the Purchase Price in accordance
with  Article 3.

 

 

10.15 _Agency for Non-Parties_

 

 

Notwithstanding Section 11.12, each Party hereby accepts each indemnity in
favour of each of its Indemnified  Parties who are not Parties as agent and
trustee of that Indemnified Party. Each Party may enforce an indemnity in
favour of any of that Party's Indemnified Parties on behalf of each such
Indemnified Party.

 

 

10.16 _Exclusive Remedy_

 

 

Following the Time of Closing, a Party's sole and exclusive remedy for any
claim or cause of action it may have  against any Party or, in the case of
the Purchaser, the Sellers' Representative in respect of this Agreement or any
certificate or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, whether
arising under or based upon any Law or otherwise, shall  be limited to, as
applicable:

 

 

(a) seeking an equitable remedy pursuant to Section 11.2;

 

  -76-

 

 


 

 

 

(b) disputes under Section 3.6 (which disputes shall be resolved in accordance
with dispute resolution mechanism set out therein); and

 

 

(c) the rights of the Party under this Article 10 and, in the case of the
Purchaser, under the RandW Insurance Policy.

(f) _Notice_. Any notice or communication given or received by, and any
decision, action, failure to act within a designated  period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Sellers'
Representative shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement,  consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all sellers,
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller; and each
Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any such notice, communication,  decision, action, failure to act within
a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time,  agreement,
consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such Seller.
Each Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent is hereby relieved from

such Seller acting on XXX own behalf).

 


 

 

11.2 _Equitable Remedies_

 

 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if
available) would not be an adequate  remedy, shall occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby) in accordance  with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled as a matter of right to apply to a
court of competent jurisdiction for relief by way of an injunction,  specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties  agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and/or other equitable relief on any basis, including the
basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of
an injunction, specific  performance and/or other equitable relief is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking: (i)
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement; (ii) to
enforce specifically the terms and  provisions of this Agreement; and/or
(iii) other equitable relief, shall not be required to show proof of actual
damages or to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
remedy.

any sort or type, whether known or unknown, and which occurred, existed or was
taken or permitted at or prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 11.3(b)  shall release, waive, discharge,
relinquish or otherwise affect the express rights or obligations of any party
to the extent arising out of this Agreement, any of the agreements, covenants,
instruments or transactions contemplated herein. The  Sellers, the Sellers'
Representative, and their respective Affiliates shall refrain from, directly

11.5 _Amendments and Waivers_

 

 

No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding on
either Party unless consented to  in writing by such Party. No waiver of any
provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision,
nor shall any waiver of any provision of this Agreement constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. No  waiver shall be
inferred from or implied by any failure to act or delay in acting by a Party
in respect of any default, breach or non-observance or by anything done or
omitted to be done by the other Party. The waiver by a Party of any default, 
breach or non-compliance under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of
that Party's rights under this Agreement in respect of any continuing or
subsequent default, breach or non-observance (whether of the same or any other
nature).

 

 

11.6 _Assignment_

 

 

No Party may assign any of its rights or benefits under this Agreement, or

consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that      the
Purchaser may assign or transfer all or any part of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement to any one or more of its Affiliates, provided that no
such assignment or transfer shall relieve the Purchaser of its obligations
under this  Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser's rights in
the preceding sentence shall include the right to designate that any one or
more of its Affiliates purchase any portion of the Purchased Assets, assume
any portion of the Assumed  Liabilities, and advance consideration in respect
thereof, and the Sellers shall

 

  -81-

 

 


 

 

execute such instruments (including such instruments contemplated by Section
8.2(b)) as may be necessary to give effect to such  assignments and
allocations.

Except as otherwise expressly set out in this Agreement, each Party shall pay
for its own costs and expenses  incurred in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement

therein, including the fees and expenses of legal  counsel, financial
advisors, brokers, accountants and other professional advisors and fees
payable to any Governmental Authorities.

Prior to issuance of the initial press release announcing the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Purchaser  shall consult with the Sellers'
Representative in good faith with respect to the contents thereof, it being
understood that the Sellers' and Sellers' Representative consent is not
required in connection with any public disseminations pertaining to  the
transactions contemplated hereby made by the Purchaser, including in
connection with such public filings required to be made by the Purchaser
pursuant to applicable Law.

further acts, documents and things as may be required or necessary for the
purposes of giving effect to this Agreement, including  such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment, confirmation,
certificates and other instruments as may be reasonably requested in order to
more effectively transfer, convey and assign the Purchased Assets and to
effectuate the  transactions contemplated herein.

 

 

11.11 _Counterparts_

 

 

This Agreement and all documents contemplated by or delivered under or in
connection with this Agreement may be  executed and delivered in any number
of counterparts, with the same effect as if all parties had signed and
delivered the same document, and all counterparts shall together constitute
one and the same original document.

 

 

11.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_

 

 

Except as provided in Sections 6.12 (DandO Indemnification and Insurance), 10.15
(Agency for Non-Parties), and  11.3 (Release) (i) no Person that is not a
Party shall be entitled to the benefit of any provisions of this Agreement or
have any rights hereunder, and (ii) no Person that is not a Party shall be

11.13 _Wrong Pockets_

 

 

(a) If within 18 months following Closing, any Party discovers that any right,
title or interest in any asset not used in connection with the Purchased
Business (a "Wrong Pocket Excluded Asset") that was meant to be retained by a
Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement was transferred to the
Purchaser, then (i) the Purchaser shall transfer, as  promptly as reasonably
practicable, such Wrong Pocket Excluded Asset to the applicable Seller for no
additional consideration and the Purchaser's expense; and (ii) the Purchaser
shall hold such right, title and interest in and to the Wrong Pocket 
Excluded Asset in trust for the applicable Seller until such time as the
transfer is completed.

 

 

(b) If within 18 months following Closing, any Party discovers that any right,
title or interest in any asset used in connection with the Purchased Business

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including, for certainty, any ___XXX_
_ ___XXX__ _ _ _XXX_ _ ___XXX     ____ _ _ _ _ _XXX_ _ XXX_____  and 90
Days Account Receivable) was not transferred to the Purchaser as contemplated
by this Agreement, then (i) the applicable Seller shall transfer, as promptly
as reasonably practicable, such  Wrong Pocket Asset to the Purchaser for no
additional consideration and at Sellers' expense; and (ii) the Seller shall
hold such right, title and interest in and to the Wrong Pocket Asset in trust
