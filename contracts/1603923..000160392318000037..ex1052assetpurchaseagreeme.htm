following rules of interpretation shall apply:



Calculation of Time Period. When calculating the period of time before which,
within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant
to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such
period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business
Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.

Exhibits/Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are hereby
incorporated and made a part hereof and are an integral part of this
Agreement. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. Any matter or item disclosed on one schedule shall be deemed to
have been disclosed on each other schedule to which the applicability of such
matter or item is readily apparent from the context. Any capitalized terms
used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall be
defined as set forth in this Agreement.

Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include all
genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall include the plural
and vice versa.

any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise specified.

Herein. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof" and "hereunder"
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which
such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

(b)The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and

intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly

provision of this Agreement.



ARTICLE II.



CONSIDERATION





2.1 Consideration. The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets shall
be (a) an amount in cash equal to Four Hundred Thirty Million U.S. Dollars
$430,000,000 (the "Purchase Price") and (b) the assumption by Schlumberger of

2.2 Payment of Purchase Price. On the Closing Date, Schlumberger shall pay the

with the Allocation. Neither Schlumberger nor Weatherford shall take any Tax
position inconsistent with the Allocation and neither Schlumberger nor
Weatherford shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the Allocation by any

provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Schlumberger or
Weatherford from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax
Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and neither

the employment or performance of services, or termination of employment or

workers' compensation claims against Weatherford that relate to the period on

its Affiliates to, make available to Schlumberger such non-confidential data
in personnel records of Transferred Employees as is reasonably necessary for
Schlumberger to transition such Transferred Employees into Schlumberger's
records.



(b) From time to time following the Closing, Weatherford and Schlumberger
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge
and deliver all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and
acquaintances and such other instruments, and shall take such further actions,
as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Schlumberger
and its respective successors or assigns, all of the properties, rights,
titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended to be
conveyed to Schlumberger under this Agreement and to assure fully to
Weatherford and its Affiliates and their successors and assigns, the
assumption of the liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by
Schlumberger under this Agreement, and to otherwise make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.



(c) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
any Purchased Asset, including any Contract, Permit, certificate, approval,
authorization or other right, which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable
without the consent of a third party or a Governmental Body or is cancelable
by a third party in the event of an assignment ("Nonassignable Assets") unless
and until such consent shall have been obtained. With respect to Purchased
Contracts or Permits that are material for the Business as a going concern
after the Closing Date, Weatherford shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Schlumberger at its request for up to 180 days
following the Closing Date in endeavoring to obtain such consents promptly;
provided, however, that such efforts shall not require Weatherford to incur
any expenses or Liabilities or provide any financial accommodation or to
remain secondarily or contingently liable for any Assumed Liability to obtain
any such consent. Schlumberger and Weatherford, as applicable, shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained,
any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate all
Liabilities under any and all Purchased Contracts or other Liabilities that
constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the unconditional
release of Weatherford, so that, in any such case, Schlumberger shall be
solely responsible for such Assumed Liabilities. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, and the terms of such Nonassignable Asset, in the event
consents to the assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such Nonassignable
Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by Weatherford in trust
for Schlumberger and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be
performed by Schlumberger in Weatherford's name and all benefits and
obligations existing thereunder shall be for Schlumberger's account.
Weatherford shall take or cause to be taken at Schlumberger's expense such
actions in its name or otherwise as Schlumberger may reasonably request so as
to provide Schlumberger with the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to
effect collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable
under the Nonassignable Assets, and Weatherford shall promptly pay over to
Schlumberger all money or other consideration received by it in respect of all
Nonassignable Assets. As of and from the Closing Date, 

Weatherford on behalf of itself and its Affiliates authorize Schlumberger, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Nonassignable
Assets, at Schlumberger's expense, to perform all the obligations and receive
all the benefits of Weatherford or its Affiliates under the Nonassignable
Assets and appoints Schlumberger its attorney-in-fact to act in its name on
its behalf or in the name of its applicable Affiliate and on such Affiliate's
behalf with respect thereto, and Schlumberger agrees to indemnify and hold
Weatherford and its Affiliates, agents, successors and assigns harmless from
and against any and all Liabilities and Losses based upon, arising out of or
relating to Schlumberger's performance of, or failure to perform, such
obligations under the Nonassignable Assets.



3.6 Use of Marks. For the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in Section
7.2, Schlumberger shall not use any Marks owned by Weatherford or any of its
Affiliates.

agreement, document, or instrument or certificate contemplated by this
Agreement or to be executed by Weatherford in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Weatherford

under, or give rise to acceleration of rights or obligations, or a right of
termination or cancellation under any provision of (i) the certificate of
formation and company agreement of Weatherford; (ii) any Contract or Permit
related to the Purchased Assets to which Weatherford is a party or by which
any of the Purchased Assets are bound; (iii) any Order of any Governmental
Body applicable to Weatherford or by which any of the Purchased Assets are
bound; or (iv) any applicable Law, other than, in the case of clauses (ii),

cancellations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.



(b) No consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or authorization of, or
declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Person or Governmental
Body is required on the part of Weatherford in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Weatherford Documents, the compliance by
Weatherford with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, or the consummation

Weatherford of any other action contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i)
compliance with the applicable requirements of Antitrust Law, and (ii) for
such other consents, waivers, approvals, Orders, Permits, authorizations,
declarations, filings and notifications, the failure of which to be obtained
or made would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

enforceable leasehold interest in each of the Purchased Assets, free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Exceptions.



(b) The Purchased Assets, together with the services being provided under the

previously provided pursuant to the Excluded Contracts, constitute all
property and other rights owned, leased, licensed or used by Weatherford
primarily in connection with the Business.

31, 2016, (i) Weatherford has conducted the Business in the Ordinary Course of
Business; (ii) there has not been any damage, destruction or loss, whether or

not committed, pursuant to any Purchased Contract, to make any capital
expenditures primarily related to the Business that, after the Closing Date,

(a) Weatherford and its Affiliates have filed all material Tax Returns they
were required to file with respect to the Business. All such Tax Returns were
true, correct, and complete in all material respects. All material Taxes due
and owing with respect to the Business have been paid. Neither Weatherford nor
any of its Affiliates is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any income Tax Return with respect to the Business. There
are no Liens for Taxes (other than Permitted Encumbrances) upon any of the
Purchased Assets. Weatherford and its Affiliates have, to the extent relating
to the Business, withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld
and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party, and all Forms W-2 and

Weatherford or its Affiliates with respect to the Business claimed or raised
by any Tax Authority in writing.

limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency with respect to the Business.

Tax allocation or sharing agreement with respect to the Business (other than
provisions in agreements entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and
not primarily concerning Taxes).

5.7 Real Property.



(a) Title.



(i)Set forth in Schedule 5.7 is a correct and complete list as of the date
hereof of (1) all owned real property included in the Purchased Assets (the
"Owned Real Property"), (2) all leasehold estates in all leased real property
included in the Purchased Assets (the "Leased Real Property") and (3) all
licenses, occupancy or possessory interests and other real property interests
included in the Purchased Assets (the "Other Real Property Rights"). Schedule
5.7 also identifies all Owned Real Property, Leased Real Property and Other
Real Property Rights that also are used as of the date hereof by other
businesses of Weatherford or its Affiliates and describes the nature of such
use by such other businesses of Weatherford or its Affiliates, 

and such use does not interfere with the Business. No Owned Real Property is
leased to any third party, Weatherford has not granted any third party any
license, possessory or occupancy right or other similar right therein other
than Permitted Exceptions, and no Leased Real Property is subleased to any
third party. Weatherford or a Subsidiary thereof has (A) good and indefeasible
fee title to all Owned Real Property, (B) good and valid title to the
leasehold estates in all Leased Real Property and (C) good and valid title to
all Other Real Property Rights, in the case of each of clauses (A), (B) and
(C) above, free and clear of all Liens, subject only to Permitted Exceptions.



(ii)There are no outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights of first
refusal to purchase any of the Owned Real Property or any portion of or any
interest therein.



(b) Real Property Leases. Each of the leases relating to the Leased Real
Property (each, a "Real Property Lease") is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of Weatherford and, to
the Knowledge of Weatherford, the other parties thereto, enforceable against
Weatherford and, to the Knowledge of Weatherford, the other parties thereto,
in accordance with their respective terms. No Real Property Lease has been
amended, modified or supplemented except as described in Schedule 5.7. No
party to any Real Property Lease has repudiated any provision thereof, and
neither Weatherford nor, to the Knowledge of Weatherford, any other party
thereto, is in breach of any of its respective obligations thereunder, and no
event has occurred (including the failure to obtain any consent) which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default
thereunder.



(c) Joint Use Facilities. Schedule 5.7 sets forth a correct and complete list
as of the date hereof of all material owned or leased real property of
Weatherford that is not being included in the Purchased Assets but which is
used by the Business (each, a "Weatherford Joint Facility").



(d) No Other Realty. Except for the Owned Real Property, the Leased Real
Property and the Other Real Property Rights, neither Weatherford nor any
Affiliate thereof owns or leases any real property used or held for use
primarily in or related primarily to or necessary for the operation or conduct
of the Business or has any options to acquire any fee interest or leasehold
interest in any real property for use primarily in or related primarily to or
necessary for the operation or conduct of the Business.



(e) No Claims. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Weatherford,
threatened condemnation, eminent domain, expropriation or similar proceedings,
or any pending, contemplated or threatened Legal Proceedings or any
unsatisfied claims or judgments which could in any manner adversely affect the
use or market value, affecting the Owned Real Property, the Leased Real
Property or the Other Real Property Rights. There are no existing public
improvements which may reasonably be expected to result in any special
assessment against the Owned Real Property.



(f) Title Exceptions. All utility easements, rights of access and other
easements and similar rights serving the Owned Real Property are legally
enforceable to permit the operation of the Business in substantially the
manner in which the Business is currently operated. Other than Permitted
Exceptions, there are no encroachments upon the Owned Real Property and no
encroachments of any improvements composing 

the Owned Real Property onto adjacent property, except for such encroachments
as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on a particular item of real
property. The improvements to the Owned Real Property (and the current uses
thereof) do not violate set-back, building or side lines, or any applicable
land use covenants, zoning regulations, or similar enforceable restrictions,
nor do they encroach on any easements located on the Owned Real Property.



5.8 Tangible Personal Property.



(a) Schedule 5.8(a) sets forth an accurate and complete list, in all material
respects, of all fixed assets of Weatherford that are included in the
Purchased Assets, including a description, location and net book value for
each fixed asset.

primarily related to the Business ("Personal Property Leases") involving

under any of the Personal Property Leases.

Schlumberger shall remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Weatherford
Marks from all assets and materials including any vehicles, equipment,
business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,

them shall preserve and keep the records held by it or its Affiliates relating
to the Business for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date and
shall make such records and personnel available to the other as may be
reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, legal proceedings or Tax audits against or governmental
investigations of Weatherford or Schlumberger or any of their respective
Affiliates or in order to enable Weatherford or Schlumberger to comply with
their respective obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement,

such party shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other
party and such other party shall have the right at its option and expense,
upon prior written notice given to such party within that ninety (90) day
period, to take possession of the records within one hundred and eighty (180)
days after the date of such notice.

announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party;

(a) Non-solicit of Employees. For a period of one (1) year from and after the
Closing Date, Weatherford shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, hire or solicit, or encourage any other Person to hire
or solicit, any Transferred Employee or encourage any such individual to leave
the employment of Schlumberger. This Section 7.5(a) shall not prevent
Weatherford from soliciting any Transferred Employee who responds to a general
solicitation that is a public solicitation of prospective employees and not
directed specifically to any Transferred Employee.



(b) Confidential Information. From and after the Closing Date, Weatherford
shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than authorized
officers, directors and employees of Schlumberger or use or otherwise exploit
for its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Schlumberger, any
Confidential Information (as defined below). Weatherford shall not have any
obligation to keep confidential (or cause its officers, directors or
Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the
extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Law or court
order; provided, however, that in the event disclosure is required by
applicable Law, Weatherford shall, to the extent reasonably possible and
permitted by Law or court order, provide Schlumberger with prompt notice of
such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that Schlumberger may seek
an appropriate protective order. "Confidential Information" shall mean any
confidential information with respect to the Business, including, methods of
operation, customers, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs,
inventions, know-how, software, marketing methods, plans, personnel,
suppliers, competitors, markets or other specialized information or
proprietary matters. "Confidential Information" does not include, and there
shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is
generally available to the public on the date of this Agreement or (ii)
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder, or (iii) is Weatherford's or
its Affiliates' proprietary information to the extent not included within the
Purchased Assets.



(c) Blue Pencil. If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any of
the covenants set forth in this Section 7.5, or any part thereof, is
unenforceable because of the duration of such provision, such court shall have
the power to modify any such unenforceable provision in lieu of severing such
unenforceable provision from this Agreement in its entirety, whether by
rewriting the offending provision, 

deleting any or all of the offending provision, adding additional language to
this Section 7.5 or by making such other modifications as it deems warranted
to carry out the intent and agreement of the parties as embodied herein to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. The parties hereto expressly agree
that this Agreement as so modified by the court shall be binding upon and
enforceable against each of them.



(d) Equitable Relief. The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section
7.5 relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary
character and a violation of any of the terms of this Section 7.5 may cause
irreparable injury to the parties, the amount of which will be impossible to
estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Therefore,
Schlumberger will be entitled to seek an injunction, restraining order or
other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event
of any breach of this Section 7.5. The rights and remedies provided by this
Section 7.5 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies
which Schlumberger may have hereunder or at law or in equity. In the event
that Schlumberger were to seek damages for any breach of this Section 7.5, the
portion of the consideration delivered to Weatherford hereunder which is
allocated by the parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered a
measure of or limit on such damages.



7.6 Tax Matters



(a) Unless Schlumberger and Weatherford otherwise agree, Schlumberger,
Weatherford and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate as set forth below
with respect to Tax matters for time periods ending on or before the Closing.



(i) Schlumberger and Weatherford shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns (including Tax Returns in respect of Transfer Taxes) and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding or matter with respect to Taxes of or with
respect to the Business, Purchased Assets or Allocation. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding or matter and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder.



(ii) Each party shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Business, Purchased Assets or Allocation until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the
other party, any extensions thereof) and shall, at such time, if the other
party so requests, allow the other party to take possession of any such books
and records that are exclusively related to the Business or Purchased Assets.



(iii) Schlumberger shall be entitled to all refunds of Taxes (whether received
by payment, credit, offset or otherwise) for which Schlumberger is liable
under this Agreement, and Weatherford shall be entitled to all refunds of
Taxes (whether received by payment, credit, offset or otherwise) for which
Weatherford is liable under this Agreement. Each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any refund of Taxes to which any
other party may be entitled pursuant to this Agreement and, upon receipt of
any such refund, shall promptly transmit such amount to the party entitled
thereto.



(iv) Each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, when
requested by another party, any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Body.



(v) Weatherford shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed (taking into account all applicable extensions), all Tax Returns
of or relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets for all Tax periods
ending on or before the Closing Date.



(vi) All Tax Returns of or relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets
for all Tax periods beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after
the Closing Date ("Straddle Period Tax Returns") shall be prepared and timely
filed by Schlumberger if Schlumberger or any of its Affiliates is responsible
for filing such Tax Return pursuant to applicable Law. All other Straddle
Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and timely filed by Weatherford. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, all Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice. The party preparing a
Straddle Period Tax Return shall deliver to the other party a draft of the
portions of such Straddle Period Tax Return that relate to the Business or the
Purchased Assets at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date thereof
(taking into account any extension) and shall not unreasonably reject any
comments thereto received from such other party at least five (5) days prior
to the due date thereof (taking into account any extension). For the avoidance
of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Schlumberger shall have no right to prepare, file, review or
comment on any income Tax Returns of Weatherford or any of its Affiliates.



(vii) To the extent the same are subject to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.5, Schlumberger and its Affiliates shall promptly notify Weatherford
upon receipt by such party of written notice of any inquiries, claims,
assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes of or with respect
to the Business or Purchased Assets and relating to any Tax period beginning
on or before the Closing Date (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or
similar event, a "Tax Matter"). Any failure to so notify the other party of
any Tax Matter shall not relieve such other party of any liability with
respect to such Tax Matters except to the extent such party was actually and
prejudiced as a result thereof.



(viii) Weatherford shall have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Matters,
including any settlement or compromise thereof, provided, however, that
Weatherford shall keep Schlumberger reasonably informed of the progress of any
Tax Matter and shall not effect any such settlement or compromise that would
reasonably be expected to adversely impact Schlumberger in any Tax period
ending after the Closing Date without obtaining Schlumberger's prior written
consent thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.



(ix) The parties agree that any expenses incurred by a party in connection
with the cooperation described in this Section 7.6(a) shall be the
responsibility of the party incurring the cost and no reimbursement shall be
sought from the requesting party.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all transfer, stamp,
documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes
(including all applicable real estate transfer 

Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby ("Transfer Taxes") will be borne by Schlumberger.
Weatherford and Schlumberger further agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any such Transfer Taxes.



(c) Schlumberger and Weatherford shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of applications for exemptions in respect of Taxes that may result as a
consequence of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



(d) If at any time a Governmental Body, the Code or other applicable Law
requires a Person under this Agreement to make any withholding or deduction in
respect of any payments made by the Person to a recipient pursuant this
Agreement:



(i) not less than ten (10) days prior to making any such withholding or
deduction, such Person shall provide written notice to the recipient
identifying the amount of and applicable Law requiring such withholding or
deduction, and the Person shall cooperate in good faith with the recipient to
the extent reasonable to obtain reduction of or relief from such obligation to
make such deduction or withholding;



(ii) such Person shall withhold or deduct the amount required from the payment
otherwise payable to the recipient;



(iii) the amount withheld or deducted shall be remitted to the relevant
Governmental Body within the time prescribed by Law;



(iv) the Person shall promptly provide copies of any applicable remittance
documentation with the Government Body to the recipient; and



(v) such amount that is withheld or deducted shall be considered for the
purposes of this Agreement to have been paid to the recipient by such Person
in respect of the payment.



7.7 Schlumberger Purchase under Certain Excluded Contracts. Weatherford and
Schlumberger agree that Schlumberger shall, in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth on Exhibit A hereto, purchase the products listed on
Exhibit A hereto under (i) the Supply Agreement, dated September 29, 2011,
between Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems, LLC and Black Horse, LLC and (ii)
the Supply Agreement, dated December 31, 2014, between Weatherford
International plc and The Lubrizol Corporation.



7.8 Know-how. Schlumberger acknowledges and agrees that Weatherford shall have
five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date to deliver to Schlumberger the
Documents included in the Purchased Assets relating to End User Know-how. In
the event that, during the one (1) year period following the Closing Date,
Schlumberger identifies any Field Operations Know-how or other End User Know-
how owned by Weatherford or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date and used and
necessary for the conduct of the Business in the Territory as conducted in the
Ordinary Course of Business, Schlumberger shall so notify Weatherford and
Weatherford or its applicable Affiliate shall disclose and license royalty-
free such Field Operations Know- 

how or End User Know-how (as applicable) to Schlumberger to make, have made,
use, sell, offer for sale, or deploy any Licensed Product and Service Offering
solely for the conduct of the Business and inside the Territory, on terms
commensurate with the Inbound IP License Agreement. Such license shall be
granted retroactively, as if such Field Operations Know-how or End User Know-
how (as applicable) had been licensed as of the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Weatherford be required to disclose or
license any Manufacturing Know-how pursuant to this Section.



7.9 Confidentiality.



(a) In the event that any license to Field Operations Know-how is granted
pursuant to Section 7.8, Schlumberger shall, for a period of twenty (20) years
after the effective date of such license, maintain the Field Operations Know-
how in confidence and not disclose Field Operations Know-how without
Weatherford's prior written consent, provided, however, that Schlumberger may
disclose Field Operations Know-how to Schlumberger's employees and contractors
who:



(i) have a need to know Field Operations Know-how for purposes of
Schlumberger's exercise of its rights under Section 7.8;



(ii) have been apprised of this restriction; and



(iii) are themselves bound by written nondisclosure agreements at least as
restrictive as those set forth in this Section 7.9, provided further that
Schlumberger shall be responsible for ensuring its employees' and contractors'
compliance with, and shall be liable for any breach by its employees and
contractors of, this Section 7.9.



(b) Schlumberger shall use reasonable care, at least as protective as the
efforts it uses for its own confidential information, to safeguard Field
Operations Know-how licensed pursuant to Section 7.8 from use or disclosure
other than as permitted under Sections 7.8 and 7.9(a).



(c) If Schlumberger becomes legally compelled to disclose any Field Operations
Know-how licensed pursuant to Section 7.8, then Schlumberger shall:



(i) provide prompt written notice to Weatherford so that Weatherford may seek
a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive their rights under
this Section 7.9; and



(ii) disclose only the portion of Field Operations Know-how that it is legally
required to furnish.



(d) Schlumberger's obligations of confidentiality in this Section 7.9 shall
not extend to or include Field Operations Know-how that:

(i) before receipt by Schlumberger from Weatherford or its Affiliates was (x)
publicly available or (y) obtained by Schlumberger from a source other than
Weatherford or its Affiliates, or was otherwise in Schlumberger's possession,
free of any restrictions on its use or disclosure;



(ii) after Schlumberger's receipt thereof (x) becomes publicly available
without the fault of or breach of this Agreement by Schlumberger or (y) is
acquired by Schlumberger from a source other than Weatherford or its
Affiliates, free of any restrictions owed to Weatherford or its Affiliates on
its use or disclosure; or



(iii) is independently developed by an employee of Schlumberger who did not
have access to the Field Operations Know-how.



7.10 No Warranties. Weatherford does not warrant the accuracy of any Field
Operations Know-how or End User Know-how, nor does Weatherford warrant that
Licensed Product and Service Offerings performed in accordance with such Field
Operations Know-how or End User Know-how will be free from claims of
infringement of the patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights
of any third party. Weatherford shall not incur any liability arising out of
the supply of Field Operations Know-how or End User Know-how under, in
connection with, or as a result of this Agreement, whether pursuant to
warranty, contract, negligence, or otherwise.

[RESERVED]



ARTICLE IX.



INDEMNIFICATION



9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing through and including the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties
of Weatherford set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.4(a), 5.6, 5.10, and 5.15 and
the representations and warranties of Schlumberger set forth in in Sections
6.1 and 6.2 (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive
the Closing until ninety (90) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to the particular matter that is the
subject matter thereof and (ii) the representations and warranties of
Weatherford set forth in Section 5.14 (Environmental) shall survive the
Closing through and including the 24 month anniversary of the Closing Date (in
each case, the "Survival Period"); provided, further, however, that any
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to
any Losses as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have given notice
(stating in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to
the indemnifying party in accordance with Section 9.3(a) before the
termination of the applicable Survival Period.



9.2 Indemnifications.



(a) Subject to Sections 9.1, 9.4 and 9.6 hereof, Weatherford hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold Schlumberger and its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the "Schlumberger Indemnified Parties") harmless from
and against: 

(i) any and all losses, liabilities, obligations and damages (individually, a
"Loss" and, collectively, "Losses") based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the failure of any representations or warranty of Weatherford set forth
in this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects at the Closing Date;



(ii) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
breach of any covenant or other agreement on the part of Weatherford under
this Agreement or any Weatherford Document;



(iii) any and all Losses based upon or arising directly from any Excluded
Asset or any Excluded Liability; and



(iv) any and all notices, actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands,
assessments, judgments, costs, penalties and expenses, including attorneys'
and other professionals' fees and disbursements (collectively, "Expenses")
incident to any and all Losses with respect to which indemnification is
provided hereunder or Section 9.5(a).



(b) Subject to Sections 9.1, 9.4 and 9.6 hereof, Schlumberger hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold Weatherford and its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the "Weatherford Indemnified Parties") harmless from
and against:



(i) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
failure of any representations or warranty of Schlumberger set forth in this
Agreement to be true and correct in all respects at the Closing Date;



(ii) any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
breach of any covenant or other agreement on the part of Schlumberger under
this Agreement or any Schlumberger Document; and



(iii) any and all Expenses incident to any and all Losses with respect to
which indemnification is provided hereunder or Section 9.5(b).

9.3 Indemnification Procedures.



(a) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any
claim or demand ("Claim") shall be asserted by a third party in respect of
which payment may be sought under Section 9.2 hereof (regardless of the
limitations set forth in Section 9.4), the indemnified party shall reasonably
and promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Claim of which it
has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the
indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole
option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to
any Losses indemnified against hereunder, it shall within fifteen (15) days
(or sooner, if the nature of the Claim so requires) notify the indemnified
party of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal 

with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, the
indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
such Claim at the expense of the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party
shall assume the defense of any Claim, the indemnified party may participate,
at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Claim. The parties hereto
agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 9.3 to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the
indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party,
settle or compromise any indemnifiable Claim or permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide to such other
party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the
indemnifiable Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer
solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and
the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing of the
indemnifying party's willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject
to the applicable limitations of Sections 9.4, pay the amount called for by
such offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the
indemnified party may continue to contest such indemnifiable Claim, free of
any participation by the indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such indemnifiable Claim that the indemnifying party
has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the
amount of the settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept
plus the Losses of the indemnified party relating to such indemnifiable Claim
through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate
Losses of the indemnified party with respect to such indemnifiable Claim. If
the indemnifying party makes any payment on any indemnifiable Claim, the
indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all
rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or
other Claims of the indemnified party with respect to such indemnifiable
Claim.



(b) After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder, the indemnified party
shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by
the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter.



9.4 Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of Representations and
Warranties.



(a) An indemnifying party shall not have any liability under Section 9.2(a)(i)
or Section 9.2(b)(i) hereof unless the aggregate amount of Losses and Expenses
to the indemnified parties finally determined to arise thereunder based upon,
attributable to or resulting from the failure of any representation or
warranty to be true and correct, other than the Fundamental Representations,
exceeds $4,000,000 (the "Basket") and, in such event, the indemnifying party
shall be required to pay only that amount that Weatherford's or Schlumberger's
respective indemnity obligations exceed the Basket, subject to the Cap.



(b) Neither Weatherford nor Schlumberger shall be required to indemnify any
Person under Sections 9.2(a)(i), 9.2(a)(ii), 9.2(b)(i) or 9.2(b)(ii) for an
aggregate amount of Losses or Expenses exceeding $43,000,000 (the "Cap") in
connection with Losses or Expenses related to the breach of any representation
and warranty of Weatherford or Schlumberger in Articles V and VI, respectively
other than 

for the breach of any Fundamental Representation; provided, however, that if a
Loss is subject to indemnification under both (x) Section 9.2(a)(i) and (y)
Section 9.2(a)(iii), then the Cap shall not apply.



(c) For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements shall be ignored.



(d) The parties shall have a duty to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any Losses to which a right of indemnity applies hereunder.



9.5 Tax Indemnification.



(a) Weatherford hereby agrees to be liable for and to indemnify and hold the
Schlumberger Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses
and Expenses in respect of (i) all Taxes relating to the Business or the
Purchased Assets with respect to any Taxable period, or portion thereof,
ending on or before the Closing Date; and (ii) all Taxes of Weatherford or any
member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Weatherford is or
was a member, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any
predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision under
state, local or foreign Law). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Weatherford shall not indemnify nor hold the
Schlumberger Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any Losses or
Expenses in respect of Taxes relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets
with respect to any Taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the
Closing Date.



(b) Schlumberger hereby agrees to be liable for and to indemnify and hold the
Weatherford Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses
and Expenses in respect of (i) all Taxes relating to the Business or the
Purchased Assets with respect to any Taxable period, or portion thereof,
beginning after the Closing Date; (ii) all Transfer Taxes allocated to
Schlumberger pursuant to Section 7.6(b); and (iii) any failure by Schlumberger
to timely pay any and all Taxes or Transfer Taxes required to be borne by
Schlumberger pursuant to this Agreement.



(c) For purposes of Section 7.6 and this Section 9.5, in the case of a taxable
period that includes the Closing Date, Taxes shall be allocated to the periods
before and after the Closing Date as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes such as
property taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated to periods before and after the
Closing Date on a per diem basis and (ii) in the case of Taxes based on net or
gross income, or transactional taxes such as sales taxes, the portion of such
Taxes allocable to the period before the Closing Date shall be computed on the
assumption that the taxable period ended on the Closing Date.



9.6 No Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive
damages of such other Person, including loss of future revenue, income or
profits, diminution of value or loss of business reputation or opportunity
relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof, except for an indemnifying
party's obligation to an indemnified party for consequential, incidental,
indirect, special or punitive damages of any third party.



9.7 Exclusive Remedy; Negligence of Indemnified Parties. Except for either
party's ability to seek equitable relief under Section 7.2 and Section 7.5,
the indemnification obligations of the parties under this Article IX shall be
the exclusive remedy for any claim by any party against any other party based
on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall be effective
regardless of by whom asserted, and regardless of whether any Claim or Loss
results solely or in part from the active, passive or concurrent negligence
(but not gross negligence) of any of the parties to be indemnified; provided, 

however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, that this Section 9.7 shall not apply to liability for fraud or
Willful Breach (it being understood that, for purposes of this Agreement,
"Willful Breach" shall mean a material breach that is the consequence of an
omission by, or act undertaken by or caused by, the breaching party with the
knowledge that the omission or taking or causing of such act would cause a
breach of this Agreement). The parties acknowledge that this statement
complies with the Express Negligence Rule and is conspicuous.



ARTICLE X.



MISCELLANEOUS



10.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of
Weatherford and Schlumberger shall bear their own expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.



10.2 Waiver of Jury Trial; Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process.



(a) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.



(b) The parties hereby agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas or in any State court
located in Houston, Harris County, Texas, so long as one of such courts shall
have subject-matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and
that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
arisen from a transaction of 

business in the State of Texas. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such action may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.

schedules and exhibits hereto) represents the entire understanding and
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements, including that certain Master
Formation Agreement, dated March 24, 2017, by and among Schlumberger,
Schlumberger Canada Limited, Weatherford and Weatherford Canada Ltd., and all
Schedules and Exhibits thereto (the "MFA"), understandings, negotiations and
discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties pertaining to the subject
matter hereof and the MFA. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.



10.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to contracts made
and performed in such State.



10.5 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall
