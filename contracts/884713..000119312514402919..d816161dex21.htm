indicated by such Designated Holder in such offering on the same terms and conditions as the Non-Convertible Preferred Shares or class of security convertible into Non-Convertible Preferred Shares, as applicable, for the account of the Company or
the account of such other equityholder, as the case may be, included therein. Any withdrawal of the Registration Statement by the Company for any reason shall constitute and effect an automatic withdrawal of any Incidental Registration related
thereto. In connection with any Incidental Registration under this Section&nbsp;4(a) involving an underwritten offering, the Company shall not be required to include any Registrable Securities held by a Designated Holder in such underwritten
offering unless such Designated Holder accepts the terms of the underwritten offering as agreed upon between the Company, such other equityholders, if any, and the Company Underwriter (including, without limitation, offering price, underwriting
commissions or discounts and lockup agreement terms, subject to Section&nbsp;7(a)), and then only in such quantity as set forth below. If the Company Underwriter advises the Company in good faith that the aggregate amount of the securities requested
to be included in such offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the distribution or sales price of the securities in such offering, then the Company shall include in such Incidental Registration, to the extent of the
amount that the Company Underwriter believes may be sold without causing such material adverse effect: (i)&nbsp;in the case of a Company initiated Incidental Registration, <U>first</U> (x)&nbsp;all of the securities to be offered for the account of
