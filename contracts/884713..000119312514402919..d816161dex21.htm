(a) Subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 3.1, the aggregate merger

consideration, as adjusted, the " _Estimated Merger Consideration_ "):

 

(i) it shall be _increased_ by the amount, if any, by which Estimated Net
Indebtedness is less than zero dollars ($0) or  _decreased_ by the amount, if
any, by which Estimated Net Indebtedness is greater than zero dollars ($0);

(ii) it shall be  _increased_ by the amount, if any, by which Estimated Net

17 (iii) it shall be _decreased_ by the amount of Estimated Transaction Expenses;

be distributed to the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation

Preferred Shares are issued pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iii), in which case
Parent shall deposit Convertible Preferred Shares with an aggregate Face Value
equal to the balance (up to $10,000,000 of aggregate Face Value of Non-
Convertible Preferred Share and Convertible Preferred Shares) with the Escrow
Agent, unless no Non-Convertible Preferred Shares and less than $10,000,000 of
aggregate Face Value of Convertible Preferred Shares are issued pursuant to
Section 2.1(b)(iii) and 2.1(b)(ii), respectively, in which case, Parent shall

Stock_ ") or holders of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, the
foregoing shares shall be converted as follows:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of the

holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock
that are owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist without
any consideration payable therefor.

shares of Company Common Stock (" _Stock Option_ ") granted under the DSS
Group, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Closing, whether or not
then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the consummation of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the holder of that
Stock Option or any other Person, cancelled and converted into the right to
receive, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.6(f): (i) an
amount in cash equal to the Per Share Closing Cash Consideration _minus_ the
Per Share Cash Exercise Price Amount; (ii) a number of Convertible Preferred
Shares and/or Non-Convertible Preferred Shares (as applicable)

 



22  equal to the Per Share Closing Stock Consideration _minus_ the Per Share
Stock Exercise Price Amount; and (iii) a Pro Rata Portion of (A) any
additional consideration, without interest, as may be payable to the Former
Company Securityholders from time to time after the Closing pursuant to
Section 3.1, Article XI, Article XII and/or the Escrow Agreement, (B) the

such Stock Option shall have no further force or effect. At or prior to the
Closing, the Company shall adopt any resolutions that may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.6(d) and to terminate the Company
Stock Plan.

 

(e) _Cancellation of Certificates_. All shares of Company Common Stock, when
converted pursuant to Section 2.6(c), shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates (each a " _Certificate_
", and collectively the " _Certificates_ ") representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration set forth in Section 2.6(c), in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.7, all as set forth
in this Agreement.

 

(f) _Adjustment of Mix of Merger Consideration Payable to Former Company
Securityholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
with respect to any Non-Accredited Optionholder, if the Sellers
Representative shall so elect in its sole discretion, then the Sellers
Representative may adjust the mix of cash and stock consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.6(d) to such Non-Accredited Optionholder so that such
Non-Accredited Optionholder shall not be entitled to receive any portion of
the Aggregate Closing Stock Consideration (including the Escrow Shares) and,
in lieu thereof, the portion of the Aggregate Closing Cash Consideration
payable to such Non-Accredited Optionholder pursuant to Section 2.6(d) shall
be increased by an equivalent amount; _provided_ , that, if elected by the
Sellers Representative in its sole discretion, such Non-Accredited
Optionholder shall be required to fund such Non-Accredited Optionholders Pro
Rata Portion of the Escrow in cash out of a portion of the Aggregate Closing
Cash Consideration otherwise payable to such Non-Accredited Optionholder in
accordance with the foregoing. If the Sellers Representative elects to make
such an adjustment with respect to one or more Non-Accredited Optionholders,
the Sellers Representative shall also make pro rata adjustments to the mix
of cash and stock consideration payable to the other Former Company
Securityholders pursuant to Section 2.6(c) and Section 2.6(d) and to the mix
of cash and stock comprising the Escrow and the calculations of Closing Cash
Percentage, Per Share Cash Exercise Price Amount, Per Share Closing Cash
Consideration, Per Share Closing Stock Consideration and Per Share Stock
Exercise Price Amount (and any related definitions) shall be
appropriately adjusted by the Sellers Representative in good faith to
reflect the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall (i) the aggregate cash consideration payable at
Closing exceed the Aggregate Closing Cash Consideration, (ii) the aggregate
stock consideration

 



23  issuable at Closing exceed the Aggregate Closing Stock Consideration or
(iii) the value of the cash and/or stock (based on Face Value) deposited in
the Escrow at Closing be less than or greater than $10,000,000. Any
adjustments by the Sellers Representative in accordance with this Section
2.6(f) shall be made upon written notice to Parent prior to the Closing.
Parent agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company and the Sellers
Representative to implement any such adjustments, including agreeing to modify
this Agreement as may be reasonably necessary to give effect to the foregoing;
_provided_ , that none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any Liability with respect to any such adjustments by
the Sellers Representative or for any errors or omissions by the Sellers
Representative in connection therewith.

 

2.7 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) The Sellers Representative shall act as paying agent for the payment from
time to time of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates and
in connection with the distribution of any additional amounts as may be
payable to the Former Company Securityholders from time to time after the
Closing pursuant to Section 3.1, Article XI, Article XII or the Escrow
Agreement. The Sellers Representative shall be solely responsible for
determining the consideration payable to the Former Company Securityholders
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of their ownership of equity interests
in the Company, and none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any Liability with respect to the allocation by the
Sellers Representative of any such consideration to the Former Company
Securityholders or any disbursement thereof as directed by the Sellers
Representative or for any errors or omissions by the Sellers Representative
in connection therewith.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate or
Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time shall surrender each
Certificate to the Sellers Representative, and receive promptly upon receipt
thereof by the Sellers Representative the amounts payable under this
Agreement in respect of the shares represented by such Certificate. The
surrender of Certificates shall be accompanied by duly completed and executed
letters of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (each, a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "). The Sellers Representative shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of any Letters of Transmittal received by
the Sellers Representative, and Parent shall promptly determine whether such
Letters of Transmittal have been properly completed and executed. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate shall be deemed for all purposes
from and after the Effective Time to evidence the right to receive the
applicable amounts set forth in this Agreement but shall, subject to
applicable appraisal rights under the DGCL, have no other rights. From and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock, outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Upon the request of Parent, the
Sellers Representative shall promptly deliver to Parent all original
Certificates and Letters of Transmittal in the Sellers Representatives
possession.

 

(c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit in form satisfactory to the Sellers
Representative and Parent (but without the posting of a bond) of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Sellers Representative shall pay the amounts set forth in this Agreement
in exchange therefor pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6(c).

 



24 (d) Upon the written request of the Sellers Representative prior to the date
a payment is to be made by Parent to the Former Company Securityholders (or
to the Sellers Representative, for the benefit of the Former Company
Securityholders) hereunder, Parent shall cause a portion of such payment which
is payable to Former Company Optionholders, which amounts and the Former
Company Optionholders shall be specified in such written request, to be
distributed to the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay such amounts to the
applicable recipients thereof in accordance with the Sellers Representatives
written instructions through the Surviving Corporations normal payroll
procedures (and reduced by applicable withholdings).

 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Sellers Representative and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under
this Agreement, and from any other consideration otherwise paid or delivered
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to any
Person such amounts that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Sellers
Representative or the Escrow Agent (as applicable) are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or
any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so rightfully
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Sellers Representative or
the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, and Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Sellers Representative or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall disburse
such withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental Entity.

ARTICLE III

 

CLOSING AND POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS

 

3.1 _Closing and Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Closing_.

(i)  _Estimates_. No fewer than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent (A) a certificate signed by an executive
officer of the Company setting forth the Companys good faith estimates
and calculations of Net Working Capital (" _Estimated Net Working Capital_
"), Net Indebtedness (" _Estimated Net Indebtedness_ "), Transaction Expenses
(" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ") and the Estimated Merger Consideration
(such certificate, the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ "), in each case determined
in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules, together with supporting
documentation for such estimates and any additional information reasonably
requested by Parent, and (B) final invoices and other documentation with
respect to all Transaction Expenses to be paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to third parties at the Closing (the " _Closing Transaction
Expenses_ "). The Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared in consultation with
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Section 3.1(a) shall limit, modify, abrogate or otherwise constitute a
waiver of any of Parents or the Sellers Representatives rights to determine
Net Working Capital, Net Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b).

 



25 (ii) The Company shall provide Parent and its Representatives reasonable and
timely access to the working papers, personnel and other information
regarding such calculations of Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Net
Indebtedness and Estimated Transaction Expenses (collectively, the "
_Estimated Closing Amounts_ ") and the Estimated Merger Consideration as
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access
to the work papers of the Companys outside accountants shall be conditioned
upon Parents execution of customary indemnification and confidentiality
agreements. If Parent does not object to the Companys good faith estimates of
the Estimated Closing Amounts and the Estimated Merger Consideration within
three Business Days after its receipt of the Pre-Closing Statement, the
Estimated Closing Amounts and the Estimated Merger Consideration for purposes
of this Agreement shall be equal to the Companys good faith estimate of the
Estimated Closing Amounts and the Estimated Merger Consideration, without
otherwise affecting the rights of Parent and Former Company Securityholders to
any adjustments or payments pursuant to this Article III. If Parent shall
advise the Company within three Business Days after its receipt of the Pre-
Closing Statement of its own good faith estimate of the Estimated Closing
Amounts and such estimate in the aggregate differs from the Companys good
faith estimate of Estimated Closing Amounts in the aggregate by an amount
that is less than the product of (x) twenty percent (20%) and (y) the
Companys good faith estimate of Estimated Closing Amounts in the aggregate
(the resulting amount of the product of (x) and (y), the " _Adjustment Band_
"), then the Companys good faith estimate of Estimated Closing Amounts shall
be the Estimated Closing Amounts for purposes of this Agreement, without
otherwise affecting the rights of Parent and Former Company Securityholders
to any adjustments or payments pursuant to this Article III. If Parent shall
advise the Company prior to the Closing of its own good faith estimate of the
Estimated Closing Adjustments and such estimate in the aggregate differs from
the Companys estimate of the Estimated Closing Amounts by more than the
Adjustment Band, then Parties shall for a period of two Business Days endeavor
in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable computation of the Estimated
Closing Amounts for purposes of proceeding to the Closing, without otherwise
affecting the rights of Parent and the Former Company Securityholders to any
adjustments or payments pursuant to this Article III; _provided_ that
any such mutual agreement shall be deemed to be the Estimated Closing Amounts
for purposes of this Agreement, without otherwise affecting the rights of
Parent and the Former Company Securityholders to any adjustments or payments
pursuant to this Article III. If the Parties shall fail to mutually agree
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Estimated Closing Amounts
for purposes of this Agreement shall be equal to the Companys good faith
estimate of the Estimated Closing Amounts _minus_ the Adjustment Band, and
the Parties shall proceed to the Closing, without otherwise affecting the
rights of Parent and the Former Company Securityholders to any adjustments or
payments pursuant to this Article III; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ ,
that such difference shall be allocated among the various components of the
Estimated Closing Amounts on a pro rata basis (and such amounts shall be
deemed to be the Estimated Closing Amounts for the purposes of this
Agreement).

(iii) _Adjustment_. At the Closing, the amount of the Estimated Merger
Consideration shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.1.

 



26 (b) _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(i) _Parent s Calculations_. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent
shall prepare or cause to be prepared a calculation of Net Working Capital,
Net Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, in each case determined in
accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules, and deliver to the Sellers
Representative such calculations and the adjustments, if any, required to be
made to the Estimated Merger Consideration pursuant to Sections 3.1(b)(iii),
3.1(b)(iv) and 3.1(b)(v). Parent shall provide the Sellers Representative and
its Representatives reasonable and timely access to the working papers,
personnel and other information regarding such calculations of Net Working
Capital, Net Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses as the Sellers
Representative may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
access to the work papers of the Companys outside accountants shall be
conditioned upon the Sellers Representatives execution of customary
indemnification and confidentiality agreements.

 

(ii) _Determination_. The Sellers Representative will have a period of up to
45 days following the delivery of Parents calculations of Net Working
Capital, Net Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the Merger Consideration
to notify Parent of any disagreements in reasonable detail with such
calculations in writing (such notice being a " _Seller Objection_ "). If the
Sellers Representative fails to deliver a Seller Objection before the end of
such 45-day period, Parents calculation of Net Working Capital, Net
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and the adjustments, if any, required
to be made to the Estimated Merger Consideration pursuant to Sections
3.1(b)(iii), 3.1(b)(iv) and 3.1(b)(v) shall become final and binding on the
Parties. In the event the Sellers Representative delivers to Parent a Seller
Objection before the end of such 45-day period, Parent and the Sellers
Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements that
they may have with respect to any matter specified in the Seller Objection
during the 30-day period following the delivery to Parent of a Seller
Objection. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Seller Objection within
such 30-day period, either the Sellers Representative, on the one hand, or
Parent, on the other hand, shall have the right to submit the determination
of the matters to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is not available for such
assignment, then an independent accountant of national standing reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Sellers Representative (the " _Independent
Auditor_ "), whose decision shall be final and binding on the Parties. The
Sellers Representative and Parent shall each submit to the Independent
Auditor, with a copy to the other, a written statement setting forth their
respective positions as to any and all matters that remain in dispute within
15 days after the appointment of the Independent Auditor. There will be no ex
parte communications between the Sellers Representative or Parent and the
Independent Auditor, other than written answers by the Sellers Representative
or Parent to written questions of the Independent Auditor (copies of which
shall be provided simultaneously to such other Party), but each of Parent and
the Sellers Representative shall have the right to reply in writing to the
written submission of the other within 10 days after its receipt of the
others written submission. The Independent Auditor shall be instructed to
resolve all disputed items within 30 days of the submission to it of such
items. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Auditor (A) shall be
bound by the provisions of this Section 3.1(b)(ii), (B) may not resolve any
disputed matter of law, (C) may not assign a value to any item greater than
the highest value claimed for such item or less than the lowest value for such
item claimed by either Parent or the Sellers Representative, (D) shall
restrict its decision to such items included in the Seller Objection which are
then in dispute, (E) may review only the written presentations of the Sellers
Representative and Parent in 

 



27  resolving any matter which is in dispute, (F) shall render its decision in
writing setting forth in reasonable detail the basis upon which its decision
was made, and (G) shall base that decision on the Balance Sheet Rules and
GAAP. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be paid by
the Party whose aggregate estimate of the disputed amount differs most greatly
from the determination of the Independent Auditor. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution mechanism contained in this
Section 3.1(b)(ii) shall be the exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes
regarding the adjustments relating to Net Working Capital, Net Indebtedness
and Transaction Expenses. Notwithstanding the preceding, however, the fact
that Net Working Capital, Net Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses, or any
adjustment required to be made to the Estimated Merger Consideration shall
have become final and binding on the Parties, shall not preclude any party
from making any claim for any breach of any representation and warranty of
another party or any failure by any other party to perform its covenants and
agreements hereunder not known at the time such amounts shall have become
final and binding on the Parties, or preclude any party from recovering as
Damages any amount by which Net Working Capital, Net Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses, or the Merger Consideration was overstated or understated due to
such breach, or nonperformance, as applicable, except to the extent actually
taken into account in the purchase price adjustment pursuant to this Section
3.1.

 

(iii) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii), is less than Estimated Net Working
Capital, then the Estimated Merger Consideration shall be reduced dollar-for-
dollar by the amount of such shortfall. If Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii), is greater than Estimated Net
Working Capital, then the Estimated Merger Consideration shall be increased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such difference.

 

(iv) _Net Indebtedness Adjustment_. If Net Indebtedness, as finally determined
pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii), is less than Estimated Net Indebtedness, then
the Estimated Merger Consideration shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the
amount of such shortfall. If Net Indebtedness, as finally determined pursuant
to Section 3.1(b)(ii), is greater than Estimated Net Indebtedness, then the
Estimated Merger Consideration shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the
amount of such difference.

 

(v) _Transaction Expenses Adjustment_. If Transaction Expenses, as finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii), are less than Estimated
Transaction Expenses, then the Estimated Merger Consideration shall be
increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such shortfall. If Transaction
Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii), are greater
than Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the Estimated Merger Consideration
shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such difference.

 

(vi) _Merger Consideration; Payment of Adjustments_. The Estimated Merger
Consideration as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.1(b) shall constitute
the " _Merger Consideration._ " If it is determined pursuant to this Section
3.1(b) that the Estimated Merger Consideration paid at the Closing is less
than the Merger Consideration, subject to Section 3.1(a), Parent shall pay
such difference in cash to one or more accounts as the Sellers Representative
shall designate in writing (for the benefit of the Former Company
Securityholders). None of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have

 



28  any Liability with respect to the allocation thereof by the Sellers
Representative to the Former Company Securityholders or for any errors or
omissions by the Sellers Representative in connection therewith. If it is
determined pursuant to this Section 3.1(b) that the Estimated Merger
Consideration paid at the Closing is greater than the Merger Consideration,
the Sellers Representative shall pay such difference in cash to Parent out
of the Sellers Representative Reserve Amount; _provided_ , that if the then
remaining balance of the Sellers Representative Reserve Amount is less than
such difference, then the Former Company Securityholders shall each be
obligated pay to Parent their respective Pro Rata Portion of the remainder of
such difference in cash in accordance with the terms of their respective
Letters of Transmittal, _provided_ _further_ , at the election of
Parent, Parent may access the Escrow to satisfy any amounts due to Parent
from a Former Company Securityholder and unpaid for 30 days after notice is
delivered to the Sellers Representative hereunder, at which time the
obligation of such Former Company Securityholder to pay Parent hereunder
shall become an obligation of such Former Company Securityholder to replenish
the Escrow in cash by such amount.

 

(vii) _Timing and Method of Adjustment Payment_. Any cash payment to be made
as a result of adjustments made in accordance with this Section 3.1(b) shall
be paid within five Business Days of the final determination of such
adjustments in accordance with Section 3.1(b)(ii) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts as shall be designated by
Parent or the Sellers Representative (for the benefit of the Former Company
Securityholders), as the case may be, at least two Business Days prior to the
date that such payment is to be made. Upon the written request of
the Sellers Representative at least two Business Days prior to the date
payment is to be made, Parent shall cause a portion of any payment pursuant to
this Section 3.1(b) which is payable to Former Company Optionholders, which
amounts and the Former Company Optionholders shall be specified in such
written request, to be distributed to the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
such amounts to the applicable recipients thereof in accordance with the
Sellers Representatives written instructions through the Surviving
Corporations normal payroll procedures (and reduced by applicable
withholdings).

necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations for the interim
period and of the financial condition as of the date of the Interim Balance
Sheet but excluding, such other, if any, normal year-end adjustments (the

reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification. There are no
material claims (other than routine claims for benefits, and appeals of such
claims) or lawsuits that have been threatened in writing or instituted against
any Employee Plan or any fiduciary (as defined in Section 3(21)(A) of ERISA)
of any Employee Plan. No Employee Plan is under audit or investigation by the

administer, such plan.

Company and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours and without undue
interruption to the Company and its Subsidiaries businesses. Except as
provided in this Agreement, any disclosure whatsoever during such
investigation shall not constitute any expansion of or additional
representations or warranties of the Company or any of its Affiliates beyond
those specifically set forth in this Agreement. All such access shall be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
obligation to provide Parent with any information the disclosure of which is

as applicable.

Person, a " _Pay-Off Lender_ ") and the amounts owed to each Pay-Off Lender,
and (ii) customary pay-off letters with respect to the Funded Indebtedness
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent (the " _Pay-Off
Letters_ "), to be executed and delivered by the Pay-Off Lenders at the

Indebtedness and release of all Liens granted pursuant thereto. Parent and the

67 6.6 _Assistance with Financing_.

 

(a) The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and

participate therein and to otherwise cooperate with the reasonable requests of
Parent and Debt Providers) and sessions with prospective lenders, investors
and ratings agencies and assisting Parent in obtaining ratings as
contemplated by the Applicable Financing;

to be filed with the SEC and using commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its independent auditors (and independent auditors of previously acquired
entities, should such auditors have audited financial statements to be
included in such offerings documents, prospectuses or other documents to be
filed with the SEC) to issue comfort letters to the Debt Providers and other
financing sources providing the Applicable Financing in a form (including as
to negative assurance and change period) customarily received by underwriters
or initial purchasers of debt securities, as the case may be;

 



68 (v) assisting, and using commercially reasonable efforts to cause its

any offering documents;

solvency matters in the form set forth as an annex to the Commitment Letter)
and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral (including cooperation
in connection with the pay-off of the Funded Indebtedness and the release of
related Liens and termination of security interests and cooperation in
connection with Parents efforts to obtain environmental assessments and title
insurance);

 

(viii) providing commercially reasonable assistance to Parent to obtain
waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals from other parties to material
leases, encumbrances and Contracts to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and, upon reasonable advance notice, to arrange

Providers and their respective Representatives with other parties to material
leases, encumbrances and Contracts as of the Closing;

 

(ix) taking all commercially reasonable actions necessary to (A) permit
Parents financing sources (including the Debt Providers) to evaluate the
Companys and its Subsidiaries current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes of

(x) assisting the Debt Providers in obtaining field examinations and

Closing Date;

(xi) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary or customary to permit the
consummation of the Applicable Financing, including any high yield debt
financing; and

 

(xii) providing at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date all
documentation and other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries as
is required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act.

 



69 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require any
such cooperation to the extent that it would (i) require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to enter into any financing, purchase or other agreement
for the Applicable Financing that would be effective prior to the Closing or
(ii) result in any officer, director or manager or other Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability with
respect to any matters relating to the Applicable Financing. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment
or other fees in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be reimbursed by Parent for any reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred or otherwise payable by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation
contemplated by this Section 6.6. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all
Liabilities suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Applicable Financing or Alternate Financing (including actions taken in
accordance with this Section 6.6), except (x) to the extent that
such Liabilities arise out of or result from any willful misconduct or bad
faith of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any Representatives of any of
the foregoing or (y) to the extent of amounts paid in settlement of any such
Liability if such settlement is effected without the consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to periodically
update any Required Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that
such Required Information (i) is Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable
requirements set forth in the definition of "Required Information" and (iii)
would not, after giving effect to such update(s), result in the Marketing
Period to cease to be deemed to have commenced. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, in order to most effectively access the financing markets,
require the reasonable cooperation of the Company under this Section 6.6 at
any time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date
hereof and the Closing; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the
markets.

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Applicable Financing; _provided_ ,
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.7 _Company Stockholder Approval_. Immediately after the execution of this
Agreement and in lieu of calling a meeting of the Company Common Stockholders,
Company Common Stockholders shall execute and deliver to the Company and
Parent the Written Consent. In connection with the Written Consent, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to comply, and shall comply in all
material respects, with the DGCL, including Sections 228 and 262 thereof, and
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company. If an executed copy of such Written Consent is
not delivered to Parent within 24 hours after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as
set forth in Section 10.1(g).

6.8 _Exclusivity_. The Company agrees that between the date of this Agreement
and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the

 



70  Company and the Sellers Representative shall not, and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and their
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate,
consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or offers from any Person
(other than Parent) (i) relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any
portion of the equity of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or all or a
substantial portion of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other business combination
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) to enter into a
recapitalization, reorganization or any other extraordinary business
transaction involving or otherwise relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, or (iv) to effect or make
further preparations for an IPO; or (b) participate in any discussions,
conversations, negotiations or other communications regarding, or furnish to
any Person (other than Parent) any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any
effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of the foregoing. The
Company and the Sellers Representative shall, and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and such Affiliates
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Person (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any
of the foregoing. The Company shall notify Parent promptly if any proposal
regarding any of the foregoing is made and shall promptly advise Parent of the
contents thereof (and, if in written form, promptly provide Parent with
copies thereof). Any breach of this Section 6.8 by the Sellers
Representative, its and the Companys respective Affiliates and
Representatives, shall be deemed to be a breach by the Company for all
purposes.

 

6.9 _Termination of Affiliate Transactions_. On or prior to the Closing Date,
unless otherwise directed by Parent, the Company shall terminate, or cause to
be terminated, in full all Affiliate Transactions set forth on Section 6.9 of
the Company Disclosure Letter or required to be set forth on (but that are not
set forth on) Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter, without any
Liability to Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
following the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to terminate
any Affiliate Transaction that is required to be set forth on (but is not set
forth on) Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to
result in a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 9.2(a). Any
costs of the Surviving Corporation arising from a failure to terminate any
Affiliate Transaction set forth on Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be Damages and shall not be subject to the limitations on
indemnification set forth in Section 11.2(a)  (c).

 

6.10 _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date this Agreement to the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
(a) except as set forth on Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter, not
make or revoke a material election with regard to Taxes or file any material
amended Tax Returns and (b) not make any material change in any Tax accounting
methods, except as may be appropriate to conform to changes in Tax Laws.

 

6.11 _Sale-Leaseback_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may,
without Parents consent, (a) enter into a sale-leaseback transaction with
respect to the real property assets currently owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and identified on Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter
(a " _Sale-Leaseback_ ") on market terms so long as any such Sale-Leaseback
would be treated as

 



71  an operating lease under GAAP and would not result in an additional lease
payment that reduces the forecasted amount of 2015 EBITDA, as defined and set
forth on Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, by more than
$3,278,228 and (b) if a Sale-Leaseback is consummated, at the Companys
election, distribute the proceeds of such Sale-Leaseback prior to the Closing
or retain such proceeds. The Company will negotiate the terms of any such
Sale-Leaseback in good faith with a third party. The Estimated Merger
Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of (i)
seven (7) multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of (x) $3,278,228 over (y)
the additional lease payment for the 2015 fiscal year resulting from any Sale-
Leaseback (if any). For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, (A) if no Sale-Leaseback is entered into by
the Company prior to the Closing, the Estimated Merger Consideration shall be
increased by $22,947,596 and (B) a Sale-Leaseback must be treated as an
operating lease under GAAP and not as a financing lease under GAAP and must
not constitute Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, any Sale-Leaseback
lease shall have a term of not fewer than 15 years and, if a Sale-Leaseback
has not been consummated by the Closing, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be subject to any contract or agreement that would require
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to effect a Sale-Leaseback
following the Closing.

 

ARTICLE VII

PRE-CLOSING AND OTHER COVENANTS OF PARENT

7.1 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all the conditions precedent that
are set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.3, and Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated. From the date hereof until
the Closing, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any fact,
circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or taking of which
(a) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (b) has resulted in, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, any representation or warranty made by
Parent hereunder not being true and correct or (c) has resulted in, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Sections 9.1 or 9.3 to be satisfied.

 

7.2 _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For the period beginning at the Closing and ending on a date not earlier
than the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause
any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide to the employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than those employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement) employed on the Closing Date (collectively,
the " _Employees_ ") the same or greater base salary, wages and bonus
opportunities as in effect on the Closing Date and employee benefits, that in
the aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee benefits provided
to such Employees immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that any
defined benefit pension plan benefits, post-employment life or health
insurance benefits, sale, retention or change in control payments payable by
the Company or its Subsidiaries shall not be taken into account for purposes
of this Section 7.2(a); _provided_ _further_ that Parent may transition
Employees to Parent Plans (as defined below) and the Parent Equity 

 



72  Plan and cash bonus programs during such period. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section or this Agreement is intended to limit any legal
obligations that Parent may have to assume obligations under and/or to
continue to be bound by the terms of any collective bargaining agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently a party or prohibit
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
at any time after the first anniversary of the Closing from changing an
employees salary or benefits (to the extent such changes are not prohibited
by a written employment agreement with such employee and are permitted by
this Agreement).

(b) Each Employee shall be given credit for service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any employee benefit
plans or arrangements of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
(the " _Parent Plans_ ") for all purposes of eligibility to participate in,
vesting and accrual of benefits solely to the extent past service was
recognized for such Employees under the comparable Employee Plans immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 7.2(b) shall be construed to require crediting of service for
purposes of the calculation of benefits or that would result in (i)
duplication of benefits or (ii) service credit for any purposes under a
defined benefit pension plan or post-employment life or health
insurance benefit plan.

(c) With respect to any Parent Plan that is a welfare plan that replaced
coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
insurance carriers to waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Employees to the extent such conditions and
exclusions and waiting periods were satisfied or did not apply to such
Employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each Employee with
credit, or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause insurance carriers to
provide credit, in determining any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
the Closing Date in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan, to the extent
credited under the welfare plans maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.2 are intended to be for the sole
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the Parties, and nothing in this
Section 7.2, whether express or implied, shall create any third-party
beneficiary or other rights in any other Person, including any Employees or
former employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, any participant in any
Employee Plan or Parent Plan or any dependent or beneficiary thereof.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as
an amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or
on and after the Closing Date, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or shall limit the right of Parent to continue, or amend, terminate or
otherwise modify, any such plan following the Closing Date. Nothing contained
herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring,
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries

 



73  to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the
employment of any specific Person, and nothing contained in this Agreement
shall change the at-will nature of any employees employment.

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as defined
in Section 280G(c) of the Code) a waiver by such individual of any and all
payments (or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so that such payments
and benefits would not be "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code and (ii) submit to the Company Common Stockholders for a vote all
such waived payments in a manner such that, if such vote is adopted by the
Company Common Stockholders in a manner that satisfies the stockholder
approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder, no payment received by such "disqualified individual"
would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined
without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code). Such vote shall establish
the "disqualified individuals" right to the payment or other compensation. In
addition, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to the Company Common
Stockholders of all material facts concerning all payments that, but for such
vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to any such "disqualified
individual" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that satisfies Section
280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Company agrees to provide to Parent written drafts of the stockholder
disclosure statement, waivers, and stockholder approval forms that will be
provided to disqualified individuals and the Company Common Stockholders in
advance of delivering such documents to the disqualified individuals and
Company Common Stockholders, as applicable, and allow Parent and its
representatives a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on such
documents.

 

7.3 _Operating Covenants_. Except (a) as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) as described on Section 7.3 of the Parent Disclosure Letter or
(c) to the extent that the Sellers Representative shall otherwise consent in
writing, during the period from the date hereof to the earlier of the Closing
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent
shall not take any action that would require the consent of the Series A
Convertible Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 6(c) of Exhibit F-1 hereto,
assuming, for purposes of this Section 7.3 only, that all such shares were
issued on the date hereof.

7.4 _Books and Records_. For a period of five years from the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Sellers Representative reasonable access
to the Representatives, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
upon reasonable advance written notice during regular business hours and
without undue interruption to the Company and its Subsidiaries businesses,
for the purpose of obtaining information reasonably required in connection
with the preparation of Tax Returns or the defense of any claim by a third
party or any other reasonable purpose, and will permit the Sellers
Representative to make copies of any such information (at the Sellers
Representatives sole cost and expense, which the Sellers Representative may
pass on to Sellers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to provide
Parent with any information or documents the disclosure of which is prohibited
or restricted under applicable Law or is legally privileged; provided, that

 



74  Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate to permit such disclosure in a manner that is permitted under
applicable Law or that is consistent with the preservation of such privilege,
as applicable.

7.5 _Contact with Customers, Distributors and Suppliers, Etc_. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives to)
directly or indirectly, initiate contact with any employee, customer,
supplier, distributor or other material business relation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

7.6 _Consent Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to commence, as
promptly as reasonably practicable on or following the later of (i) the date
of this Agreement and (ii) the date on which the Company receives the Consent
Solicitation Documents (as defined below) from Parent, a consent solicitation
with respect to the Company Notes (the " _Consent Solicitation_ ") for the
purposes of obtaining the waivers and consents from the holders of the Company
Notes requisite to amend the Company Notes Indenture with respect to the
assumption or guarantee by a Subsidiary of Parent (the " _AssumptionSub_ ")
of the Company Notes on customary terms and conditions reasonably acceptable
to Parent and the Company. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the waivers and consents from holders requisite to effect
such amendments or waivers; _provided_ that (x) the Company shall have
received from Parent the completed Consent Solicitation Documents, which shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company and (y) at the time of such
commencement, Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in all
material respects with all of their agreements and covenants required by this
Agreement to be performed on or prior to the time that the Consent
Solicitation is to be commenced.

(b) The Company shall retain, at Parents sole cost and expense, the financial
institution reasonably requested by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as sole solicitation agent in connection with the Consent
Solicitation. The Company shall cause DS Services of America, Inc. to execute
a customary solicitation agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company, with such financial institution and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist the solicitation agent
in obtaining a list of beneficial holders of the Company Notes (or
The Depository Trust Company participants holding Company Notes on behalf of
such beneficial holders), customary legal opinions as may be reasonably
requested by the solicitation agent and any other customary documents
reasonably required by the solicitation agent in connection with the Consent
Solicitation at Parents sole cost and expense.

(c) Parent covenants and agrees that, on or before the Closing Date, assuming
the requisite consents under the Company Notes Indenture are received,
AssumptionSub shall execute such supplemental indentures to the Company Notes
Indenture, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Company, as may be necessary to implement the amendments set forth in the
Consent Solicitation Documents (the " _Supplemental Indentures_ ").

 



75  The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the expiration of
the Consent Solicitation, assuming the requisite consents under the Company
Notes Indenture are received, DS Services of America, Inc. shall execute such
Supplemental Indentures; provided that the Supplemental Indentures shall not
become operative unless and until the consent payment has been paid to the
holders of the Company Notes as set forth in the Consent Solicitation
Documents and each other condition thereto set forth in the Consent
Solicitation Documents, including the effectiveness of the Closing, has been
satisfied or waived. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, including AssumptionSub, have any obligation to
authorize, adopt or execute any Supplemental Indenture or other agreement
relating to the Consent Solicitation that would become effective prior to the
Closing.

(d) Parent and the Company shall each execute and deliver such customary
closing certificates and other similar documents as may be reasonably
requested by the trustee for the Company Notes in connection with the
execution of the Supplemental Indentures. Parent and the Company shall each
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such customary legal
opinions as may be reasonably requested by the trustee for the Company Notes
in connection with the execution of the Supplemental Indentures, at Parents
sole cost and expense. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
consummation of the Consent Solicitation is a condition to Closing.

(e) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent, at its own expense, shall prepare and deliver to the Company all
necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the solicitation of
holders of Company Notes pursuant to the Consent Solicitation, including the
consent solicitation statement, related letters of transmittal and other
related documents (collectively, the " _Consent Solicitation Documents_ ").
Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Consent Solicitation Documents. All documents
distributed to the holders of the Company Notes in connection with the Consent
Solicitation shall be subject to prior review and comment by the Company and
Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time
prior to the completion of the Consent Solicitation, any information in the
Consent Solicitation Documents should be discovered by the Company or Parent
necessary to ensure that the Consent Solicitation Documents do not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be disseminated to the holders of the Company Notes.

 

(f) Parent shall pay any consideration payable to the holders of the Company
Notes and all fees and expenses of any solicitation agent, information agent,
depositary or other Person retained in connection with the Consent
Solicitation (or if paid by the Company, Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Company), and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company for all of its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with the Consent Solicitation
promptly following incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation of such
costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum amount of any consent fee
for which Parent is responsible shall be as separately agreed by the Parent
and Company on the date hereof. Parent and Merger Sub

 



76  shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors and
Representatives and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act for and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
Consent Solicitation and the Consent Solicitation Documents; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to
indemnify and hold harmless any such party or person to the extent that any
such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred arises from disclosure regarding
the Company (i) supplied by the Company in writing expressly for use in the
Consent Solicitation Documents or (ii) in the Holdings SEC Documents, in
either case that have contained a material misstatement or omission.

 

7.7 _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
consummate and obtain the Applicable Financing on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter ( _provided_ , that Parent may amend the
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who have not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date of this Agreement), including (i) maintaining in effect the
Commitment Letter and negotiating and entering into definitive agreements ("
_Financing Agreements_ ") with respect to the Applicable Financing on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter or on other terms in
the aggregate no less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions in the
Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions, covenants
and agreements that are in the control of Parent or its Affiliates set forth
in the Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements, and (iii) at the
Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, consummating
the Applicable Financing as is contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event that all conditions in the Commitment
Letter have been satisfied, or upon funding will be satisfied, and all of the
conditions to Closing in Section 9.1 and Section 9.2 have been satisfied or
waived by Parent in accordance with this Agreement, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the lenders providing such Financing
to fund the Financing on the Closing Date or to close on the other Applicable
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter. At the Closing, Parent shall
borrow the maximum amount of Applicable Financing to be available at the
Closing that would not result in Parent and its Subsidiaries having a
net leverage ratio (as set forth in Section 6(c)(6) of the Terms of Series A
Convertible First Preferred Shares attached hereto as Exhibit F-1) in excess
of 4.5-to-1.0 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such borrowing and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and may, in Parents sole discretion,
borrow an amount that would cause Parent and its Subsidiaries to have a net
leverage ratio (as so set forth) in excess of 4.5-to-1.0 (but in no event
greater than 5.0-to-1.0) on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
borrowing and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 7.7 shall
require, and in no event shall the commercially reasonable efforts of Parent
be deemed or construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to commence
litigation or to pay any fees materially in excess of those contemplated by
the Commitment Letter.

 



77 (b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a timely basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to consummate the Applicable Financing,
including if for any reason Parent has concluded in good faith that it will
not be able to obtain any part of the Applicable Financing on the Closing
Date, and shall give the Company prompt notice (i) of any breach or default
by any party to the Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreements of which
Parent becomes aware prior to the Closing, (ii) of the receipt by Parent of
any notice or other written communication from any lender of the Financing
with respect to any (A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement of any provision of
the Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement prior to the Closing or (B)
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter
or any Financing Agreement that could reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing or (iii) of any other circumstance, effect, event,
occurrence, condition, state of facts or development that would reasonably be
likely to prevent or impede or delay the consummation of the Financing, to the
extent it becomes aware of such circumstance, effect, event, occurrence,
condition, state of facts or development. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in any event within three Business Days after any request by the Company
in writing, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(c) Except to the extent otherwise contemplated in Section 7.7(d), Parent
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, replace or amend
the Commitment Letter if any such replacement financing or amendment (i)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing available on the Closing Date
from that contemplated in the Commitment Letter, (ii) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to prevent or delay the Closing, or (iii) would otherwise
reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or delay the Closing or (B) be less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent than the Commitment Letter then in
effect. Parent shall not release or consent to the termination of the
obligations of the other parties to the Commitment Letter, except for
assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms of or in
connection with the syndication of the Financing or as otherwise expressly
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, provided that such assignments or
replacements would not prevent or delay or impair the availability of the
Financing or the timing of the Closing. Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company executed copies of any replacements of or amendments to the Commitment
Letter. References in this Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" shall include
any replacement or amended financing obtained by Parent pursuant to and in
accordance with this Section 7.7, and references herein to "Financing" shall
be deemed to include such financing.

 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 7.7, in the event that
any portion of the Financing expires by its terms or is terminated by any of
the parties to the Commitment Letter or any lender referred to in the
Commitment Letter notifies Parent or any of its Affiliates of the
unwillingness of the lenders (or any of them) to proceed with the Financing
(an event referred to in this sentence, a " _Financing Notice Event_ "),
Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of the Financing Notice Event,
and (ii) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of the
Financing Notice Event, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain debt
financing from alternative sources in an amount at least equal to the
Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be, and on
terms and conditions not less favorable in

 



78  the aggregate to Parent as those contained in the Commitment Letter (the "
_Alternate Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with
respect to such Alternate Financing (each a " _New Commitment Letter_ " and
together, the " _New Commitment Letters_ "). Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of the New Commitment Letters and all
other agreements relating to such Alternate Financing. References in this
Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" shall include any commitment for
Alternate Financing obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 7.7(d)
and references to "Financing" shall be deemed to include such Alternate
Financing.

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its Affiliates shall
not (nor shall any of its Representatives or any of their respective
Affiliates) incur any liability to any Person under, nor have any obligations
with respect to, any financing that Parent may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that at or following the
Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries may become liable in respect of the
Applicable Financing.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the Merger is not
conditioned upon any Applicable Financing being made available to Parent.

to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any applicable Antitrust Laws. In connection therewith, if any Action is
instituted (or, to the Knowledge of Parent or the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company
shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist
any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any
Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties will consult and

with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Closing. The costs of any
DandO Insurance obtained pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be Transaction
Expenses. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement or
in the DandO Insurance, (a) no provision hereof or indemnification right in the
DandO Insurance shall limit in any way the right of any Parent Indemnified

assigns have any obligation or liability of any kind whatsoever under this
Section 8.5 to any Person with respect to indemnification, holding harmless,

the audited financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 is delivered, and (ii) April 30, 2016
(such earlier date, the " _General Survival Date_ "), except for
representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1(a), 4.2(a), (b), (c)
and (e), 4.3(a), (b) and (c) and 4.22 (the " _Company Fundamental
Representations_ "), and in Sections 5.1(a), 5.2(a), 5.2(b), 5.3 and 5.11 (the
" _Parent Fundamental Representations_ "), which shall survive the Closing
indefinitely. All covenants requiring performance prior to or at the Closing
shall expire immediately after the Closing, except for the covenants contained
in Sections 6.2, 6.9, 6.10 and 7.3, which shall expire on the General
Survival Date. The provisions of this Agreement dealing with the Escrow Shares
and Escrow, and all covenants set forth in this Agreement that are to be
performed following the Closing, shall survive the Closing and continue in
full force and effect until such covenants are performed in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) Neither the Parent Indemnified Parties nor the Seller Indemnified Parties
(each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall be entitled to seek indemnification
under Section 11.1(a)(i), Section 11.1(b)(i) or Section 12.1(a)(ii) as
applicable, until the aggregate amount of all Damages suffered by all Parent
Indemnified Parties or all Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be,
exceeds in the aggregate an amount equal to $2,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_
"), and then such Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to indemnification
for such aggregate amount of Damages that exceeds $2,500,000.

(c) Neither the Parent Indemnified Parties nor the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be deemed to have incurred any Damages under Section 11.1(a)(i) or
Section 11.1(b)(i), as applicable, unless the claim (or series of related
claims, claims having a common or substantially similar cause or claims that
arise out of reasonably common circumstances) for Damages exceeds $50,000
(the " _De Minimis Amount_ ").

(d) The aggregate amount of all payments to which the Parent Indemnified
Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive under
Section 11.1(a), Section 11.1(b) or Section 12.1(a), as applicable, shall in
no event exceed an amount equal to $10,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "), which for the
avoidance of doubt shall not preclude or limit the Parent Indemnified Parties
right to recover under any insurance policy, including the RandW Policy.

 

(e) None of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek indemnification
for Damages under this Article XI or Article XII to the extent that the
amount of Damages had been fully accounted for in any of the adjustments to
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, including in any component
of Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or Transaction Expenses. 

(f) Any Indemnified Partys right to indemnification, payment of Damages or
other remedies pursuant to this Article XI or Article XII shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted, or any knowledge or information
acquired (or capable of being acquired), by such Indemnified Party (or any
Representative of such Indemnified Party or its 

 



89  Affiliates) at any time, whether before or after the Closing Date, relating
to the facts, matters or circumstances constituting or resulting in the breach
(alleged or otherwise) of the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
giving rise to such Damages.

(g) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement shall be reduced by (i) any amounts realized by an Indemnified
Party as a result of any indemnification, contribution or other payment by any
third party (net of any costs of recovery), (ii) any insurance proceeds after
giving effect to any applicable deductible or retention (net of any increase
in premium or other costs or expenses resulting from collection under the
applicable insurance policies) or other amounts realized by the Indemnified
Party from third parties with respect to such Damages and (iii) taking into
account any tax savings actually realized in the taxable year in which the
applicable indemnification payment is made by the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Damage or in a prior taxable year (" _Tax Benefits_ "), and
if the Tax Benefit is realized after the indemnity payment has been made, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of
that Tax Benefit (it being agreed that the amount of any Tax Benefit actually
realized shall be reduced by any additional Tax cost incurred by the
Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of the applicable indemnification
payment hereunder); _provided_ , that nothing in this provision shall give
the Indemnifying Party the right to review the Indemnified Partys Tax
Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with certificates from the chief financial officer of the
Company, in the case of the Parent Indemnified Parties, and the Sellers
Representative, in the case of Seller Indemnified Parties, as to whether or
not there has been a realization of such Tax Benefits.

 

(h) The Indemnified Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(A) mitigate all Damages and (B) timely make and diligently pursue any claims
for insurance, Tax Benefits and/or other payments available from third parties
(including any indemnification available to the Company pursuant to that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (and the exhibits thereto), dated as of
July 23, 2013, by Crestview DSW Investors, L.P. and the other parties thereto)
with respect to Damages for which it will seek indemnification under this
Article XI and Article XII; _provided_ , that any out-of-pocket Damages
incurred in connection with such efforts to mitigate shall themselves be
Damages indemnifiable hereunder.

(i) For purposes of this Article XI and Article XII and of determining the
existence of a breach of any representation or warranty under this Agreement
and the amount of any Damages resulting from a breach of a representation or
warranty under this Agreement, each representation and warranty in this
Agreement will be read without regard and without giving effect to the term
"material," "Material Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifications (except with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in (i) Sections 4.4(b), 4.5(b), 4.7(a), 4.7(b)(iii), the
last sentence of 4.8(b)(i), the third sentence of 4.8(b)(ii), 4.10(a),
4.10(b), 4.11(a) or the last sentence of 4.12(b) and (ii) Sections 5.5(a),
5.5(b), 5.13(a) and 5.16)).

 

(j) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable for any punitive or
exemplary damages, except to the extent awarded by a court of competent
jurisdiction to a third party in connection with a third-party claim.

 



90 11.3 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement or otherwise, following the Closing, except with respect to
claims based on intentional fraud or a dispute under Section 3.1 (which shall
be governed exclusively by Section 3.1) or as set forth in Section 11.3(b),
the indemnification provisions of this Article XI and Article XII are the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. From and after the
Closing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, except with respect to
claims based on intentional fraud, a dispute under Section 3.1 (which shall be
governed exclusively by Section 3.1), as set forth in Section 11.3(b) or the
indemnification provisions of this Article XI and Article XII, the Parties
hereby waive all other rights, claims, remedies or actions with respect to any
matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection
herewith, whether under any applicable Law or otherwise. Except as provided
in this Article XI, Article XII or for intentional fraud, from and after the
Closing, no right, claim, remedy or action shall be brought or maintained by
any Party, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them,
by virtue of or based upon any alleged misstatement or omission respecting an
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of any of
the Parties set forth or contained in this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 11.3 shall
not preclude any Party from bringing an action for specific performance after
the Closing to require the other Party to perform any covenant or other
agreement under this Agreement to be performed after the Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) all
obligations of the Former Company Securityholders pursuant this Article XI
(other than Section 11.1(a)(ii)) and Article XII shall be satisfied solely and
exclusively from the Escrow and (ii) all obligations of the Former Company
Securityholders pursuant Section 11.1(a)(ii) shall be satisfied first from
the Escrow.

11.4 _Terms and Conditions of Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_.

(a) If any Indemnified Party shall claim indemnification under this Article XI
for any claim (other than a third-party claim) for which indemnification is
provided in Section 11.1, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, and in any
event within 30 days after obtaining facts that are sufficient for such
Indemnified Party to determine whether a claim for indemnification may be
properly made under this Article XI, give written notice (a " _Notice of
Claim_ ") to the Sellers Representative or Parent, as applicable (each, an "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), setting forth (i) the aggregate amount of the
Damages or an estimate thereof, in each case to the extent known or
determinable at such time, (ii) reasonable detail of the individual items of
such Damages included in the amount so stated, (iii) the date each such item
was paid or accrued or arose and (iv) the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach or claim to which such item is related; provided, however, that the
failure of the Indemnified Party to provide a Notice of Claim within the 30
day period described above shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure shall prejudice
any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party disputes any claim set forth in the Notice of Claim, it may, at any
time, deliver to the Indemnified Party that has given the Notice of Claim a
written notice indicating its dispute of such Notice of Claim (an "
_Objection Notice_ ").

 



91 (b) If the Indemnifying Party shall deliver an Objection Notice with respect
to any claim or claims by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall
have 30 days from the receipt of such Objection Notice to respond in a written
statement to the objection. If after such 30 day period there remains a
dispute as to any claims, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall attempt in good faith for 30 days to agree upon their rights with
respect to each of such claims, after which such Persons may pursue all other
remedies available to them at law or equity in accordance with this
Agreement.

(c) If an Indemnified Party shall claim indemnification hereunder arising from
any claim or demand of a third party for which indemnification is provided in
Section 11.1, the Indemnified Party shall promptly, and in any event within 30
days after such claim or demand is received in writing by such Indemnified
Party, give written notice (a " _Third-Party Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Party of the basis for such claim, setting forth the nature of the claim or
demand in reasonable detail (to the extent then known); _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide a Third-Party Notice
within the 30 day period described above shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure
shall prejudice any defense or claim available to the Indemnifying Party. The
respective obligations and liabilities of the Parties to indemnify pursuant to
this Article XI in respect of any Damages arising from a claim by a third
party shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:

(i) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to undertake, by counsel or
other representatives of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, the defense of such claim; _provided_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to undertake the defense of such
third party claim if (A) such claim seeks injunctive relief or is part of a
criminal Action, (B) such claim has or could reasonably be expected, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to result in Damages to the
Indemnified Party such that, after giving effect to the Basket Amount, the De
Minimis Amount and the Cap, in each case as applicable, and the other
limitations set forth in this Article XI, the Indemnifying Party would
reasonably be expected to bear less than 50% of the Damages with respect
to such claim, or (C) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to
defend in good faith such claim. In all events the insurers under the RandW
Policy and their agents and advisors shall be permitted to associate
effectively with any Party to this Agreement in the defense of any matter
which might reasonably constitute a loss that is covered by the RandW Policy.

(ii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party is permitted, but shall elect
not to, undertake such defense, or within 30 days after delivery of the
applicable Third-Party Notice shall fail to vigorously defend such third party
claim, the Indemnified Party (upon further written notice to the Indemnifying
Party) shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
of such claim, by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, on
behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle any
such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld).

 



92 (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.4(c) to the contrary, (A)
if there is a reasonable probability that a claim may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money damages
or other money payments, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its
own cost and expense, to participate in the defense, compromise or settlement
of the claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified
Partys prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld), settle or compromise any claim or consent to entry
of any judgment, unless (1) the settlement or compromise does not entail any
admission of liability on the part of any Indemnified Party and (2) the
claiming party or the plaintiff in such claim gives to the Indemnified Party
an unconditional release from all liability in respect of such claim and (C)
in the event that the Indemnifying Party undertakes defense of any claim, the
Indemnified Party by counsel or other Representative of its own choosing and
at its sole cost and expense (except that the fees, costs and expenses of such
counsel or other Representative shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if (x) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that
are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party
or (y) there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party that would reasonably be expected to materially
affect the ability of a single counsel to defend both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party), shall have the right to consult with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel or other Representatives concerning such
claim and participate in the defense thereof, and the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party and their respective counsel or other Representatives
shall cooperate with respect to such claim, subject to the execution and
delivery of a mutually satisfactory joint defense agreement.

11.5 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All indemnification payments pursuant
to this Article XI or Article XII shall be treated as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes, and such agreed treatment shall
govern for purposes of this Agreement and no Party shall take a position
inconsistent therewith on a Tax Return or otherwise, except as otherwise
required by a change in applicable Law or a final determination.

ARTICLE XII

 

TAX MATTERS

12.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing and subject to the applicable limitations
contained in Article XI and this Article XII, the Parent Indemnified Parties

any Damages to the extent actually incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties
and arising out of or as a result of any of the following:

(i) Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Taxes_ ");

(ii) Taxes imposed on a Parent Indemnified Party as a result of any breach
of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.6;

 



93 (iii) Taxes or other payments required to be paid after the date hereof by the

of Tax amounts that have already been taken into account as current
liabilities in the determination of Net Working Capital. Furthermore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
determining Damages actually incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this Article XII, the loss of any Tax asset or Tax attribute (or

a result of the loss of such Tax assets or Tax attributes) shall not be
treated as Damages.

(a) After the Closing, Parent shall promptly notify the Sellers
Representative in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement
of an audit received by Parent, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries from
any Governmental Entity or any other Person with respect to Taxes for which a
Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
12.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such notice will not
affect the Parent Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification under this
Article XII, except to the extent that any Seller Indemnified Parties are
actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information (to
the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include
copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document received from
any Governmental Entity or any other Person in respect of any such asserted
Tax liability.

(b) Payment by an Indemnifying Party of any amount due to an Indemnified
Party under this Article XII shall be made within 10 days following written
notice by the Indemnified Party that payment of such amounts to the
appropriate Governmental Entity or other applicable third party is due by the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than five Business Days before it is due
to the appropriate Governmental Entity or applicable third party. In the case
of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.3,
payment of such contested Tax will not be considered due earlier than the date
a "final determination" to such effect is made by such Governmental Entity or
a court. For this purpose, a "final determination" shall mean a settlement,
compromise, or other agreement with the relevant Governmental Entity, whether
contained in an IRS Form 870 or other comparable form, or otherwise, or such
procedurally later event, such as a closing agreement with the relevant
Governmental Entity, an agreement contained in IRS Form 870-AD or other
comparable form, an agreement that constitutes a "determination"
under Section 1313(a)(4) of the Code, a deficiency notice with respect to
which the period for filing a petition with the Tax Court or the relevant
state, local or foreign tribunal has expired or a decision of any court of
competent jurisdiction that is not subject to appeal or as to which the time
for appeal has expired. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that the

 



94  payment of a Pre-Closing Tax is required in order to contest the imposition
of such Tax, such amount shall be satisfied from the Escrow and, to the extent
such contest results in the Company receiving a refund of such Pre-Closing
Tax or using such amount to satisfy a Tax liability of the Company for a Post-
Closing Tax Period, such amount shall be (i) repaid to the Escrow in cash;
(ii) if the Escrow has been released without being exhausted, paid in cash to
the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Former Company Equityholders; or
(iii) if the Escrow has been exhausted, retained by the Parent Indemnified
Parties to the extent of any Damages for which they are entitled to
indemnification under Article XI or Article XII and, to the extent of any
excess, paid to Sellers Representative on behalf of the Former Company
Equityholders.

 

(c) All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Article XII shall be paid
reasonably promptly in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated by the Indemnified Party.

12.3 _Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, except as provided in Section 12.3(b) and 12.3(c)
below, Parent shall control, through counsel of its own choosing, the conduct
of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding
involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding
relating to an asserted Tax liability is referred to herein as a " _Contest_
").

(b) In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates solely to
Taxes for which Parent is indemnified under Section 12.1(a), the Sellers
Representative shall control the conduct of such Contest and shall not be able
to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that
adversely affects the Tax liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any
taxable year (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(c) In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates both to
Taxes for which Parent is indemnified under Section 12.1(a) and Taxes for
which Parent is not indemnified under Section 12.1(a), Parent shall control
the conduct of such Contest, but the Sellers Representative shall have the
right to participate in such Contest at its own expense, and Parent shall not
be able to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest
without the prior written consent of Sellers Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ , that
if Parent fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Contest within a
reasonable period following the receipt by Parent of notice of such Contest,
the Sellers Representative shall have the right to assume control of such
Contest and shall not be able to settle, compromise and/or concede such
Contest without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(d) The Sellers Representative and Parent agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested for the filing of
any Tax Returns and the preparation, prosecution, defense 

 



95  or conduct of any Contest. The Sellers Representative and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Contest or other
proceeding involving or otherwise relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries
(or their income or assets) with respect to any Tax and each shall execute and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this Section 12.3(d). Any information obtained under this
Section 12.3(d) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a
Contest or other Tax proceeding.

 

12.4 _Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

 

(a) The Company shall (i) prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and timely file all Tax Returns
required to be filed by it (or them) on or before the Closing Date (" _Post-
Signing Tax Returns_ "); (ii) consult with Parent with respect to all Post-
Signing Tax Returns that are income Tax Returns and all other material Post-
Signing Tax Returns and deliver drafts of such Post-Signing Tax Returns to
Parent no later than 10 Business Days prior to the date (including extensions)
on which such Post-Signing Tax Returns are required to be filed; and (iii)
fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of all Post-Signing
Tax Returns.

(b) Parent shall (i) at its own expense, prepare (or cause to be prepared) in
a manner consistent with past practice, and timely file all Tax Returns of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Returns filed with
respect to any taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Taxable Periods_ ") that are required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity after the Closing Date, provided, that Parent shall
deliver any such Tax Return to the Sellers Representative for its review at
least 20 Business Days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be
filed and Parent shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
requested by the Sellers Representative that are required by applicable Law,
and (ii) pay (or cause to be paid) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. With respect to any Tax Returns filed with respect to any Pre-Closing
Taxable Periods, to the extent that the aggregate amount of Pre-Closing
Taxes due in respect of all such Tax Returns exceeds the amount of Taxes that
are included as current liabilities in the determination of Net Working
Capital, Parent shall be entitled to recover such excess solely from the
Escrow. Parent shall notify the Sellers Representative of any amounts to be
distributed from the Escrow in respect of any such Tax Return no later than 20
Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, and Parent
and the Sellers Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to release such amount from
the Escrow and pay such amount to Parent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement no later than five Business Days prior to the date such Tax Return
is due.

(c) In the case of Tax Returns that are filed with respect to Straddle
Periods, Parent shall prepare such Tax Return in a manner consistent with
past practice, and timely file such Tax Returns with the applicable
Governmental Entity, provided, that Parent shall deliver any such Tax Return
to the Sellers Representative for its review at least 20 Business Days prior
to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed and Parent shall consider
in good faith such revisions to such Tax Returns as are requested by the
Sellers Representative with respect to any portion of such Tax Return that
is applicable to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period. The cost of preparing such Tax
Returns will be paid by the Company.

 



96 12.5 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are payable with respect
to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes Pre-
Closing Taxes shall: (a) in the case of Taxes that are either (i) based upon
or related to income or receipts, or (ii) imposed in connection with any
sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing
Date; and (b) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (a)
above) that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise measured by the level
of any item, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For
purposes of clause (a) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction,
credit or other item (including the effect of any graduated rates of Tax) that
is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Parties will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
elect with the relevant Governmental Entity to treat a portion of any Straddle
Period as a short taxable period ending as of the close of business on
the Closing Date.

12.6 _Refunds_.

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 12.6(b), if the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries receives a refund of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Taxable Period,
the Company shall promptly pay such refund to the Sellers Representative (for
the benefit of Sellers) without interest. In addition, the Company shall pay
to the Sellers Representative (for the benefit of Sellers) an amount equal
to any refund of Taxes (i) that would have been payable to Sellers pursuant to
this Section 12.6(a), except that such refund was used to pay any Tax
liability for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date (" _Post-
Closing Tax Period_ ") or (ii) would have been payable to Sellers
Representative (for the benefit of Sellers) pursuant to this Section 12.6(a)
if it were possible to file Tax Returns for each Straddle Period as if the
taxable year ended on the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12.6(a), or
otherwise, Sellers shall have no right to receive a refund or credit (or any
portion thereof) that is attributable to the carryback of losses, credits or
similar items of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, from a
Post-Closing Tax Period, to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the Company will be
entitled to retain the amount of any such credit or refund received (together
with interest thereon).

 

(c) Except as provided in Section 12.6(a) and 12.6(b), the Company will be
entitled to any refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect
of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax liability of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



97 12.7 _Amended Tax Returns_. On or after the Closing Date, the Company shall
not (and Parent shall not cause the Company to) amend, refile or otherwise
modify any Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods or Straddle Periods (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return
Amendment_ ") without the written consent of the Sellers Representative;
provided, that such consent shall not be necessary for (a) any Pre-Closing Tax
Return Amendment that relates to a correction of a manifest or obvious error
on any originally filed Tax Return, (b) any Pre-Closing Tax Return Amendment
that is made in accordance with the resolution of a Contest pursuant to
Section 12.3(b), (c) if the Parent Indemnified Parties waive indemnification
under this Agreement for claims arising out of such Pre-Closing Tax Return
Amendment and if the filing of such Pre-Closing Tax Return Amendment has no
material adverse effect to Sellers as a whole, and (d) any Pre-Closing Tax
Return Amendment required solely for the purpose of claiming a refund for a
carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

12.8 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, gross receipts, transfer, intangible,
recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges of any nature
whatsoever (including any penalties and interest) (collectively, " _Transfer
Taxes_ "), applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, if any and to the extent such Taxes or charges have not been
included in the calculation of Transaction Expenses, shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Former Company Securityholders and fifty percent (50%)
by Parent. The Sellers Representative and Parent shall jointly file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any Transfer
Taxes owed by the Former Company Securityholders hereunder shall be paid
solely from, and recourse solely to, the Escrow.

13.2 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged
irreparably in the event any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached and that money
damages would not be a sufficient remedy therefor. In the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to
seek and obtain (i) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (ii) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

(b) Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 13.2, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

(c) Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for breach
of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available to
a Party at law or equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific
performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit such Parties from
recovery of monetary damages against Parent and/or from terminating this
Agreement.

 



100 13.3 _Release_. As of the Closing, Parent, and the Company, and on behalf of
itself and each of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, together with Parent, a
" _Releasing Person_ "), hereby releases and forever discharges (and, upon the
Sellers Representatives request, Parent shall cause each other
Releasing Person to acknowledge and agree in writing to such release and
discharge) Sellers and their direct or indirect equityholders, successors and
assigns and all of their respective Affiliates and Representatives (in each
case, solely in their capacities as such) (each, a " _Released Person_ ")
from all debts, demands, causes of action, suits, covenants, torts, damages
and any and all claims, defenses, offsets, judgments, demands and liabilities
whatsoever, of every name and nature, both at Law and in equity, known or
unknown, accrued or unaccrued, which have been or could have been asserted
against any Released Person, which any Releasing Person has or ever had, which
arises out of or in any way relates to events, circumstances or actions
occurring, existing or taken prior to or as of the Closing Date in respect of
matters relating to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that
the Parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 13.3 does not apply to
and shall not constitute a release of any act of intentional fraud or any
rights or obligations arising under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents.

 

13.4 _Acknowledgement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP is representing the Company and various of
its direct or indirect equityholders, including Sellers, and their respective
Affiliates (each, an " _Equityholder Party_ ") and the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, following the
Closing, it may continue to represent Equityholder Parties in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in connection with
any disputes that may arise under this Agreement and/or any of the other
Transaction Documents. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP shall not
be precluded from or restricted from representing Equityholder Parties or
otherwise acting as attorneys for any Equityholder Party in any
matter, including any court proceeding or other matter related to this
Agreement and/or any of the other Transaction Documents and/or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Parties irrevocably consent
to any such representation and waive any conflict or appearance of conflict
with respect to any such representation.

13.5 _Disclosure Letter_. The information in the Disclosure Letters
constitutes (i) exceptions or qualifications to representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations of the Company and Parent as set forth in this
Agreement or (ii) descriptions or lists of assets and liabilities and other
items referred to in this Agreement. Any disclosure made in any Letter to this
Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosures made with respect to all
representations, warranties and the Disclosure Letters contained in this
Agreement, regardless of whether or not a specific cross-reference is made
thereto, but only to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to such
other representations, warranties and the Disclosure Letters is readily
apparent on its face. The Disclosure Letters shall not be construed as
indicating that any disclosed information is required to be disclosed, and no
disclosure shall be construed as an admission that such information is
material to, or required to be disclosed by the Company or Parent. The
Company or Parent may, at their or its option, include in the Disclosure
Letters items that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding,
and such inclusion, or any references to dollar

 



101  amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that
such items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. No
disclosure on the Disclosure Letters relating to a possible breach or
violation of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or
indication that a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The
Disclosure Letters constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated
into this Agreement for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Capitalized
terms used in the Disclosure Letters that are not defined therein shall have
the meanings given them in this Agreement.

13.6 _Dollar and Other Thresholds_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, (a) the specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any
item in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any
exhibits, schedules or attachments hereto is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other
items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts
or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within
or outside of the ordinary course of business, and (b) no Party shall use the
fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in
this Agreement or any exhibits, schedules or attachments hereto in any dispute
or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described or included in this Agreement or in any section of any
exhibits, schedules or attachments hereto is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in exhibits, schedules or attachments hereto is disclosed solely
for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any other Person of
any matter whatsoever (including any violation of any Law or breach of
Contract).

 

13.7 _Neutral Construction_. In view of the fact that each Party has been
represented by its own counsel and this Agreement has been fully negotiated
by all Parties, the legal principle that ambiguities in a document are
construed against the draftsperson of that document shall not apply to this
Agreement.

 

13.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (and may be delivered by facsimile transmission or in portable
document format (.pdf)), all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

13.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to herein), the other
Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement is not intended and shall not be deemed to confer upon or give any
Person except the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns any remedy, claim, cause of action or other right under or by reason
of this Agreement, except (a) the present and former officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective heirs, executors, and
spouses shall be deemed to be third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement
with

 



102  respect to Section 8.5 and (b) the Debt Providers shall be deemed to be
third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to Section 10.2,
this Section 13.9, Section 13.11, Section 13.15 and Section 13.16.

13.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, except that, without obtaining the prior written consent of any
Party, Parent shall be entitled to assign all or any portion of its rights
hereunder (a) to one or more of its Affiliates, (b) as collateral security to
any Person providing financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates or (c) in
connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no assignment shall
relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

13.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may only be amended by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of Parent and the Sellers Representative;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any modification or amendment of Section 10.2,
Section 13.9, this Section 13.11, Section 13.15 and Section 13.16 adversely
affecting the Debt Providers shall not be made without the prior written
consent of the Debt Providers.

13.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the Parties may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or the other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations or warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the proviso in Section
13.11, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such Party.

13.13  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will not be materially
and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable,
(b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect
and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or
by its severance from this Agreement and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of
this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

 

13.14 _Time is of the Essence_. The Parties hereby expressly acknowledge and
agree that with regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to
in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

13.15 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL;
Legal Fees_. THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE FOR

 



103  CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO AND TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION
OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND WITH
FEDERAL LAW, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; _PROVIDED_ THAT ALL ACTIONS (WHETHER AT
LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) INVOLVING ANY DEBT PROVIDER THAT MAY BE BASED
UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE APPLICABLE FINANCING, OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY DOCUMENTATION (INCLUDING THE
COMMITMENT LETTER) IN CONNECTION THEREWITH SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. EACH PARTY HERETO
HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE OR, IF JURISDICTION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN SUCH COURT, THEN THE
FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, WITH RESPECT TO ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION (WHETHER IN LAW OR
IN EQUITY AND WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) INVOLVING ANY DEBT
PROVIDER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS

[Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Merger] EXHIBIT F-1

 

(A) To establish the authorized capital of the Corporation by the creation of
[ ] Series A convertible first preferred shares (" _Series A First
Preferred Shares_ ") and [ ] Series B non-convertible first
preferred shares (" _Series B First Preferred Shares_ "), so that the classes
and maximum number of shares that the Corporation is authorized to issue shall
be [ ] first preferred shares, issuable in series, an unlimited
number of second preferred shares, issuable in series and an unlimited number
of common shares; and

(B) To provide that the Series A First Preferred Shares and the Series B
First Preferred Shares shall, in addition and subject to, the rights,
privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the first preferred
shares as a class, have attached thereto and be subject to the
rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions hereinafter set forth:

FIRST PREFERRED SHARES

 

SERIES A CONVERTIBLE FIRST PREFERRED SHARES

 

Section 1\. _Authorized_ . The Corporation shall be authorized to issue a
maximum of [ ] Series A First Preferred Shares. Series A First
Preferred Shares converted, redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired by the
Corporation shall be cancelled and not restored to the status of authorized
but unissued Shares of the series. The number of authorized Series A First
Preferred Shares may be increased or decreased by the approval of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding Series A First Preferred Shares, voting as a
separate series, provided that there shall be no decrease in the number of
authorized Series A First Preferred Shares to a number less than the number of
such series then issued and outstanding.

 

Section 2\. _Currency_ . All payments and distributions on Series A First
Preferred Shares or with respect thereto shall be made in United States
currency. All references herein to "$" or "dollars" refer to United States
currency.

 

Section 3\. _Ranking_.

 

(a) The Series A First Preferred Shares shall, with respect to the payment of
dividends and upon Liquidation rank senior to each other class or series of
shares of the Corporation (other than the Series B First Preferred Shares),
whether now outstanding or hereafter issued, including, without limitation,
the common shares of the Corporation (the " _Common Shares_ ") (all
such junior shares being referred to hereinafter collectively as " _Junior
Shares_ ").

(b) The Series A First Preferred Shares shall, with respect to the payment of
dividends and rights upon Liquidation rank equally with the Series B First
Preferred Shares of the Corporation, whether now outstanding or hereafter
issued.

 

Section 4\. _Dividends_.

 

(a) The holders of Series A First Preferred Shares shall be entitled to
receive a quarterly fixed cumulative dividend in an amount equal to
the applicable Dividend Rate (as defined herein) then in effect (the "
_Dividends_ "), (b) Subject to applicable law, Dividends shall be declared and payable
quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year
(unless any such day is not a Business Day, in which event such Dividends
shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day, without accrual to the
actual payment date), commencing on [January 1, 2015]1 (each such payment
date being a " _Dividend Payment Date_ ," and the period from the Issue Date
of the Series A First Preferred Shares to the first Dividend Payment Date and
each such quarterly period thereafter being a " _Dividend Period_ "). The
amount of Dividends payable on the Series A First Preferred Shares for any
period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number
of days elapsed. Subject to Section 6(c)(7)(B) herein, such Dividends shall be
paid to holders of Series A First Preferred Shares before any dividends shall
be declared, set apart for or paid upon any Junior Shares. 

(c) Dividends, whether or not declared, shall begin to accrue and be
cumulative from the Issue Date and shall compound at the relevant rate on
each subsequent Dividend Payment Date ( _i.e._ , no Dividends shall accrue on
another Dividend unless and until any Dividend Payment Date for such other
Dividends has passed without such other Dividends having been paid on such
date, in which case Dividends will accrue on such unpaid Dividends). If the
Corporation does not pay any Dividend in full on any scheduled Dividend
Payment Date, such unpaid Dividend will accrue at the then applicable Dividend
Rate plus an additional two and one half percent (2.5%) per annum of the
Redemption Value of each Series A First Preferred Share from such scheduled
Dividend Payment Date to the date that all accumulated Dividends on the Series
A First Preferred Shares have been paid in cash in full. Any Dividends
accrued and unpaid pursuant to this Section 4(c) on each Dividend Payment Date
shall be added to the Redemption Value until such Dividends are paid in cash
in full. For the avoidance of doubt, Dividends shall accumulate whether or
not in any Dividend Period there have been funds of the Corporation legally
available for the payment of such Dividends.

(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays
less than the total amount of Dividends then accumulated, such payment shall
be distributed pro rata among the holders of Series A First Preferred Shares
based upon the Redemption Value on the Series A First Preferred Shares then
held by each such holder. When Dividends are not paid in full, all Dividends
and any dividends on Series B First Preferred Shares shall be paid pro rata so
that the amount of Dividends and any dividends on Series B First Preferred
Shares shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio as accumulated
Dividends and accumulated dividends on Series B First Preferred Shares bear to
each other.

 

(e) All Dividends shall be paid in cash.

 

(f) Dividends shall be payable to the holders of record of Series A First
Preferred Shares as they appear on the register of the Corporation at the
Close of Business on the relevant record date, which shall be not more than
thirty (30) days nor less than ten (10) days preceding the applicable Dividend
Payment Date.

2 Section 5\. _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_.

 

(a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation or any return of capital or other distribution of assets
of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs (each, a " _Liquidation_ "), the holders of Series A First Preferred
Shares shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Corporation or
proceeds thereof (whether capital or surplus) legally available therefor, an
amount per Series A First Preferred Share equal to the greater of:

 

(1) the Redemption Value per share, plus an amount equal to any Dividends
accumulated but unpaid thereon (whether or not declared) through the date of
Liquidation; and

(2) the payment that holders of Series A First Preferred Shares would
have received had such holders, immediately prior to such Liquidation
converted their respective Series A First Preferred Shares into Common Shares
(at the then applicable Conversion Rate) pursuant to Section 7 immediately
prior to such Liquidation. 

(the greater of (1) and (2) is referred to herein as the " _Liquidation
Preference_ "). Holders of Series A First Preferred Shares will not be
entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received
the full amounts provided for in this Section 5(a) and will have no right or
claim to any of the Corporations remaining assets.

 

(b) If, in connection with any distribution described in Section 5(a) above,
the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay
in full the Liquidation Preference payable on the Series A First Preferred
Shares and the corresponding amounts payable on the Series B First Preferred
Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be paid pro rata
in accordance with the full respective amounts which would be payable on such
shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.

(c) For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, or the sale,
conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a Liquidation of the
Corporation.

Section 6\. _Voting Rights_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 6(b) and in addition to class voting rights pursuant to
applicable law, the holders of Series A First Preferred Shares shall be
entitled to (i) vote (in person or by proxy) with the holders of the Common
Shares, voting together as a single class, on all matters submitted for a vote
of holders of Common Shares, (ii) that number of votes per Series A First
Preferred Share as is equal to the number of Common Shares into which each
such Series A First Preferred Share is then convertible at the time of the
relevant record date (at the then applicable Conversion Rate) and (iii) notice
of all shareholders meetings (or pursuant to any action by written consent)
in accordance with the Corporations Articles of Amalgamation and By-laws as
if the holders of Series A First Preferred Shares were holders of Common
Shares.

 



3 (b) Subject to applicable law, Section 6(c), Section 6(d) and any other
provisions to the contrary herein:

(1) from and after the Issue Date until [ ],2 the holders of
shares of Series A First Preferred Shares shall have no voting rights pursuant
to Sections 6(a)(i) and (ii) above;

(2) from [ ] until [ ],3 the holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares shall have voting rights pursuant to Sections 6(a)(i)
and (ii) above; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to the election
of directors to the Board only and subject to Section 6(d), each holder of
Series A First Preferred Shares shall cast votes on his, her or its shares in
the same proportion as the Corporations holders of Common Shares (e.g., if a
director nominee receives 90% of the votes cast by the holders of Common
Shares, with 5% against and 5% abstaining, then each holder of Series A First
Preferred Shares shall cast 90% of his, her or its votes for such director
nominee, 5% against, and abstain from voting Series A First Preferred Shares
equivalent to 5% of the votes on an as-converted basis); and

 

(3) after [ ],4 the holders of shares of Series A First Preferred
Shares shall have voting rights pursuant to Sections 6(a)(i) and (ii) above
without restriction.

 

(c) In addition to, and not in substitution for, the rights and privileges
afforded to the holders of a class of issued shares under applicable law, for
so long as any Series A First Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the
Corporation shall not and shall not permit any direct or indirect Subsidiary
of the Corporation to, without first obtaining the written consent or
affirmative vote at a meeting called for that purpose by holders of at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of Series A First Preferred
Shares voting separately as a series, take any of the following actions:

 

(1) Any change, amendment, alteration or repeal (including, without
limitation, as a result of a merger, consolidation, or other similar or
extraordinary transaction) of any provisions of the Corporations Articles of
Amalgamation or By-laws that amends, modifies or adversely affects the rights,
preferences, privileges, conditions or voting powers of the Series A First
Preferred Shares;

(2) Any issuance or reclassification of shares of the Corporation (including,
without limitation, as a result of a merger, consolidation, or other similar
or extraordinary transaction) that would rank equal or senior to

4  the Series A First Preferred Shares, with respect to the Liquidation of the
Corporation or with respect to the declaration or payment of dividends,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the issuance of any Series A First
Preferred Shares or Series B First Preferred Shares;

(3) Any voluntary initiation of any Liquidation of the Corporation or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken
together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary or commencement of a
proceeding for bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar action with
respect to the Corporation or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any group
of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary;

 

(4) Any material change to the tax or accounting policies of the Corporation,
except any changes required by applicable law or pursuant to GAAP;

(5) Except as provided in Section 6(d) or Section 6(k) below, any increase in
the number of members of the Board if such increase would result in the Board
having more than eleven (11) members;

(6) Any incurrence, assumption or refinancing of any Indebtedness of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent that, immediately after
giving effect to such incurrence, assumption or refinancing, the ratio of (A)
the consolidated Indebtedness of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries that
would be stated on the balance sheet of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the date of determination (determined on a consolidated basis in
accordance with GAAP) minus the lesser of (i) the amount of cash and cash
equivalents (except for Restricted Cash) that would be stated on the balance
sheet of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and held by the Corporation and
its Subsidiaries as of the date of determination (determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP) and (ii) $75,000,000 to (B) the
EBITDA of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries for the most recently ended
four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available
immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is
incurred, assumed or refinanced (the " _Reference Period_ "), would not be
less than a ratio of 5.0-to-1.0 on a pro forma basis (calculated in
accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission) after giving effect to such incurrence,
assumption or refinancing and the use of the proceeds therefrom as if such
events had occurred on the first day of the Reference Period, _provided_ ,
however, in the case of any revolving credit facility, Indebtedness shall be
deemed to be incurred on the date that the commitments are entered into and
not on the date of subsequent borrowings and shall be deemed to be
outstanding continuously until such revolving credit facility is terminated
and, for this purpose, the amount of the commitment under the Credit Agreement
shall be deemed to be equal to $[ ].5

 



   5  | _Note to Draft_ : Insert an amount equal to that portion of the
revolving commitment that, together with other Indebtedness outstanding at
closing, results in a net leverage ratio of less than or equal to
5.0-to-1.0 as of Closing. 
---|--- 
 



5 (7) Any declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution (or any money
made available for a sinking fund for the payment of any dividend or
distribution) upon any Junior Shares, or the redemption of any Junior Shares,
or the purchase for cancellation, payment or acquisition for any consideration
(or any money made available for a sinking fund for the redemption) of any
Junior Shares by the Corporation, directly or indirectly; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to:

 

(A) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of Junior Shares in
connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar
arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers,
directors, managers or consultants of or to the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries; or

 

(B) regular quarterly dividends to holders of Common Shares in an amount not
to exceed US$0.06 per share; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no dividends
shall be declared or paid without a vote of the holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 6(c) if one or more quarterly
Dividends have not been paid in full on any Dividend Payment Date until such
time as all such Dividends have been paid in full; or

(8) Any issuance of Equity Securities by any Subsidiary of the Corporation to
any Person other than the Corporation or a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Corporation, any acquisition of Equity Securities of any
Person other than a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Corporation or any of its
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, or any transfer or other
transaction (including, without limitation, as a result of a merger,
consolidation, or other similar or extraordinary transaction) resulting in the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries owning Equity Securities of any Person
other than a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Corporation or any of its direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6(c)(5) above and any other restrictions on the
right to vote set forth herein, if at any time Dividends payable in respect
of the Series A First Preferred Shares have not been declared and paid for the
equivalent of six (6) or more Dividend Periods, whether or not for consecutive
Dividend Periods (a " _Preferred Dividend Default_ "), then the holders of
Series A First Preferred Shares shall be entitled to, voting separately as a
series (in person or by proxy), nominate and elect two (2) additional
directors to serve on the Board (each, a " _Preferred Share Director_ ") and
are entitled to receive notice of and attend all meetings of shareholders of
the

 



6  Corporation at which directors are to be elected. In such a case, the number
of directors serving on the Board at that time shall be increased by two (2),
and, for clarity, no sitting director of the Corporation will be forced to
resign to accommodate a Preferred Share Director.

(e) The election of Preferred Share Directors upon a Preferred Dividend
Default shall take place:

(1) if the Corporation receives the request for a special meeting more
than ninety (90) calendar days before the date fixed for the Corporations
next annual meeting of shareholders, at a special meeting for such purpose
called by the holders of at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding Series
A First Preferred Shares, or, if the Corporation receives the request for a
special meeting within ninety (90) calendar days before the date fixed for the
Corporations next annual or special meeting of shareholders, at such annual
or special meeting of shareholders; and

(2) at each subsequent meeting (or special meeting held in its place) until
all accrued and unpaid Dividends for all complete Dividend Periods prior to
the date of payment plus the Dividend for the then-current Dividend Period
have been paid in full, or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment in
cash is set aside for payment.

 

(f) At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a Preferred Share
Director, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of at least
a majority of the outstanding Series A First Preferred Shares shall be
required to constitute a quorum and the Preferred Share Directors shall be
elected by a majority of the votes cast (in person or by proxy) by the holders
of Series A First Preferred Shares, voting separately as a series. Despite
the prior sentence, if proper notice of a meeting of holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares is given, specifying the purpose of or the business to be
transacted at the meeting, and a quorum of holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares is not present, a second meeting of holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares may be held on 48 hours written notice to transact the
business specified in the original notice. Subject to applicable law, the
holders of Series A First Preferred Shares present at the second meeting
constitute a quorum and the business specified in the original notice may be
transacted by a majority vote of those holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares in attendance (in person or by proxy) at the second meeting,
voting as a class. In addition to the foregoing, holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares shall be entitled to one (1) vote (in person or by proxy) for
each Series A First Preferred Share held on any matter submitted for a vote
by the Board.

(g) Preferred Share Directors shall hold office from election until the
earlier of:

(1) his or her resignation, death, bankruptcy or incapacity;

 



7 (2) the election of his/her successor in the manner as provided herein;

 

(3) his/her removal by holders of a majority of Series A First Preferred
Shares, voting as a separate class; or

 

(4) the date on which all such unpaid Dividends have been paid in full, or
declared and a sum sufficient for such payment in cash is set aside for
payment to the holders of the Series A First Preferred Shares and the Series B
First Preferred Shares.

(h) Any vacancy occurring among the Preferred Share Directors may only be
filled by the holders of the Series A First Preferred Shares, voting
separately as a class.

 

(i) The right of the holders of the Series A First Preferred Shares to elect
the Preferred Share Directors continues until the date on which all such
unpaid Dividends have been paid in full, or declared and a sum sufficient for
such payment in cash is set aside for payment to the holders of the Series A
First Preferred Shares and shall not apply at any meeting if or to the extent
that the Preferred Share Directors, whose terms of office do not expire at
such meeting, have been previously elected by the holders of the Series A
First Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class. Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Corporations Articles of Amalgamation or By-laws, upon any
termination of the right of the holders of Series A First Preferred Shares to
elect the Preferred Share Directors as provided in this section, the term of
office of any Preferred Share Director shall terminate and the entire Board
shall be reduced accordingly so that there is no vacancy on the Board.

(j) If and when all such Dividends have been paid in full, or declared and a
sum sufficient for such payment in cash is set aside for payment, holders of
the Series A First Preferred Shares shall be divested of the voting rights set
forth in Section 6(d) (subject to re-vesting in the event of any subsequent
Preferred Dividend Defaults).

(k) Section 6(c)(5) shall not apply to any increase in the number of members
of the Board resulting from contractual rights of the initial holders of
Series A Preferred Shares to appoint directors to the Board after conversion
of the Series A Preferred Shares to Common Shares.

 

Section 7\. _Conversion_.

 

(a) _Optional Conversion_. At any time following the third (3rd) anniversary
of the Issue Date, each holder of Series A First Preferred Shares shall have
the right, at such holders option, to convert any or all of such holders
Series A First Preferred Shares into a number of Common Shares equal to the
product of the aggregate Redemption Value of the Series A First Preferred
Shares to be converted divided by US$1,000.00 multiplied by the Conversion
Rate then in effect, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, as set out in
Section 10(i), _plus_ an amount in cash per Series A First

 



8  Preferred Share equal to all accrued but unpaid Dividends (whether or not
declared) on such Series A First Preferred Share to but excluding the
applicable Conversion Date, out of funds legally available therefor. If the
Corporation does not pay in cash such accrued but unpaid dividends on such
shares, then, without limiting the right of the holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares hereunder, at the option of each holder of the Series
A First Preferred Shares, such amount may be added to the Redemption Value of
the Series A First Preferred Shares for the purposes of determining the amount
of Common Shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A First Preferred
Shares.

 

(b) _Conversion Rate_. The " _Conversion Rate_ " means [ ]6
shares, subject to adjustment in accordance with the rights, privileges,
restrictions and conditions of the Series A First Preferred Shares as set out
herein.

(c) _Conversion Procedures_. A holder must do each of the following in order
to convert its Series A First Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 7:

(1) complete and manually sign the conversion notice provided by the
Conversion Agent, and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent;

(2) deliver to the Conversion Agent the certificate or certificates
representing the Series A First Preferred Shares to be converted (or, if such
certificate or certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost
certificate affidavit and indemnity in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation);

(3) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Corporation; and

(4) if required, pay any share transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes
not payable by the Corporation pursuant to Section 8\.

The " _Conversion Date_ " means the date on which a holder complies in all
respects with the procedures set forth in this Section 7(c).

(d) _Effect of Conversion_. Effective immediately prior to the Close of
Business on the Conversion Date applicable to any Series A First Preferred
Shares, but subject to the actual conversion occurring, Dividends shall no
longer accrue or be declared on any Series A First Preferred Shares so
converted and such Series A First Preferred Shares shall cease to be
outstanding.

(e) _Record Holder of Underlying Securities as of Conversion Date_. The
Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Shares and, to the extent
applicable, cash, issuable upon conversion of Series A First Preferred Shares
on a Conversion Date shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder(s) of such Common Shares and/or cash as of the Close of Business on
such Conversion Date. As promptly as

_Note to Draft_ : Conversion Rate to be $1,000.00 divided by the Parent Share
Value (as defined in the Merger Agreement).  

---|--- 
 



9  practicable on or after the Conversion Date and compliance by the applicable
holder with the relevant conversion procedures contained in Section 7(c) (and
in any event no later than three (3) Trading Days thereafter), the
Corporation shall issue the number of Common Shares issuable upon conversion
(and deliver payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares). Such delivery of
Common Shares and, if applicable, cash shall be made, at the option of the
applicable holder, in certificated form or by book-entry. Any such certificate
or certificates shall be delivered by the Corporation to the appropriate
holder on a book-entry basis or by mailing certificates evidencing the
shares to the holders at their respective addresses as set forth in the
conversion notice. If fewer than all of the Series A First Preferred Shares
held by any holder hereto are converted pursuant to Section 7(a), then a new
certificate representing the unconverted Series A First Preferred Shares
shall be issued to such holder concurrently with the issuance of the
certificates (or book-entry shares) representing the applicable Common Shares.
In the event that a holder shall not by written notice designate the name in
which Common Shares and, to the extent applicable, cash to be delivered upon
conversion of Series A First Preferred Shares should be registered or paid, or
the manner in which such shares and, if applicable, cash should be delivered,
the Corporation shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares and, if
applicable, cash in the name of the holder and in the manner shown on the
records of the Corporation.

 

(f) _Status of Converted or Acquired Shares_. Series A First Preferred Shares
duly converted in accordance with the rights, privileges, restrictions and
conditions of the Series A First Preferred Shares as set out herein, or
otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever, shall be
retired promptly after the acquisition thereof.

 

Section 8\. _Taxes_.

 

(1) Absent a change in law or Internal Revenue Service practice, or a contrary
determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ")), each holder of Series A
First Preferred Shares and the Corporation agree not to treat the Series A
First Preferred Shares (based on their terms as set forth herein) as
"preferred stock" within the meaning of Section 305 of the Code, and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.305-5 for United States federal income tax and
withholding tax purposes and shall not take any position inconsistent with
such treatment.

(2) The Corporation shall pay any and all documentary, stamp and similar
issue or transfer tax due on (x) the issue of the Series A First Preferred
Shares and (y) the issue of Common Shares upon conversion of the Series A
First Preferred Shares. However, in the case of conversion of Series A First
Preferred Shares, the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax or
duty that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and
delivery of Common Shares or Series A First Preferred Shares in a name other
than that of the holder of the shares to be converted, and no such issue or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has
paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or duty, or has established
to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax or duty has been paid.

 



10 (3) Each holder of Series A First Preferred Shares and the Corporation agree
to cooperate with each other in connection with any redemption of part of
Series A First Preferred Shares and to use good faith efforts to structure
such redemption so that such redemption may be treated as a sale or exchange
pursuant to Section 302 of the Code; _provided_ , that nothing in this
Section 8 shall require the Corporation to purchase any Series A First
Preferred Shares; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Corporation makes no
representation or warranty in this Section 8 regarding the tax treatment of
any redemption of Series A First Preferred Shares.

Section 9.  _Redemption and Repurchase_.

(a) _Optional Redemption_. The Series A First Preferred Shares may be
redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time, at the option of the Corporation,
upon giving notice of redemption pursuant to Section 9(c), at a redemption
price per share equal to (1) the sum of the Redemption Value per share of the
Series A First Preferred Shares to be redeemed plus (2) an amount equal to
any Dividends accumulated but unpaid thereon (whether or not declared) to but
excluding the date of redemption; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Series A
First Preferred Shares shall not be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any
time any Series B First Preferred Shares of the Corporation remain issued and
outstanding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time the
Series A First Preferred Shares are convertible pursuant to Section 7(a), the
holders of Series A First Preferred Shares may, at their option, elect to
exercise any conversion rights for a period of thirty (30) days following the
receipt of notice of redemption as provided in Section 9(c) in lieu of the
redemption of any Series A First Preferred Shares.

(b) _Repurchase at the Option of the Holder Upon a Change of Control_. Upon
the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series A First Preferred
Shares shall have the right to require the Corporation to repurchase, by
irrevocable written notice to the Corporation, all or any portion of such
holders Series A First Preferred Shares at a purchase price per share equal
to the sum of (1) the Redemption Value per share of the Series A First
Preferred Shares plus (2) an amount equal to accrued but unpaid
Dividends (whether or not declared) on such Series A First Preferred Shares
to but excluding the date of repurchase.

No earlier than sixty (60) days and no later than thirty (30) days prior to
the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Corporation shall send notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the
Series A First Preferred Shares at their respective last addresses appearing
on the books of the Corporation stating (1) that a Change of Control is
expected to occur, (2) the date that the Change of Control is expected to
occur, (3) that all Series A First Preferred Shares tendered prior to a
Business Day no earlier than thirty (30) days nor later than sixty (60) days
from the date such notice is mailed shall be accepted for repurchase and (4)
the procedures that holders of the Series A First Preferred Shares must
follow in order for their Series A First

 



11  Preferred Shares to be repurchased, including the place or places where
certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the
repurchase price. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder
receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any
defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of Series
A First Preferred Shares designated for repurchase shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the repurchase of any other Series A First
Preferred Shares. The repurchase of Series A First Preferred Shares pursuant
to this Section 9(b) shall occur simultaneously with the consummation of the
Change of Control.

(c) _Notice of Redemption at the Option of the Corporation_. Notice of every
redemption of Series A First Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 9(a) shall
be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of
record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses
appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least
thirty (30) days and not more than sixty (60) days before the date fixed for
redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 9(c) shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder
receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any
defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of Series A
First Preferred Shares designated for redemption shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Series A First
Preferred Shares. Each notice of redemption given to a holder shall state: (1)
the redemption date; (2) the number of the Series A First Preferred Shares to
be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be
redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the
redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such
shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price in respect of
such shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the Series A
First Preferred Shares become convertible pursuant to Section 7, the
Corporation may not redeem any Series A First Preferred Shares unless such
holders have failed to exercise their conversion rights pursuant to Section
7(a) for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of a notice of
redemption.

(d) _Partial Redemption_. In case of any redemption of part of the Series A
First Preferred Shares at the time outstanding pursuant to this Section 9,
the shares to be redeemed shall be redeemed pro rata. Subject to the
provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to
prescribe the terms and conditions upon which the Series A First Preferred
Shares shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares
represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares without charge to the holder thereof.

 

(e) _Effectiveness of Redemption_. If notice of redemption has been duly given
and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds
necessary for the redemption have been deposited by the Corporation, in trust
for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption,
with a bank or trust company doing business in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, and having a capital and surplus of at least US $1
billion and selected by the Board, so as to be and continue to be available
solely therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate 

 



12  for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for
cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue
on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption
shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such
shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except
only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such
redemption from such bank or trust company, without interest. Any funds
unclaimed at the end of three (3) years from the redemption date shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the
holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the
Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the Series A First Preferred
Shares become convertible pursuant to Section 7, the Corporation may not
redeem any Series A First Preferred Shares unless such holders have failed to
exercise their conversion rights pursuant to Section 7(a) for a period of
thirty (30) days following receipt of a notice of redemption.

Section 10\. _Anti-Dilution Provisions_.

 

(a) _Adjustments_. The Conversion Rate will be subject to adjustment, without
duplication, under the following circumstances:

 

(1) the issuance of Common Shares as a dividend or distribution to all or
substantially all holders of Common Shares, or a subdivision or combination
of Common Shares or a reclassification of Common Shares into a greater or
lesser number of Common Shares, in which event the Conversion Rate will be
adjusted based on the following formula:

 



   ![LOGO](g816161g95m34.jpg) 

where,

 

CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business
on (i) the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or (ii) the
effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification;

 

CR1 = the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of
Business on (i) the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or (ii)
the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification;

 

OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Close
of Business on (i) the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or (ii)
the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification; and

 

OS1 = the number of Common Shares that would be outstanding immediately after,
and solely as a result of, the completion of such event (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, a number of Common Shares equal to OS0 in the event of a
dividend or distribution that does not involve the surrender or exchange of
Common Shares).

 



13 Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (1) shall be effective immediately
prior to the Open of Business on the Trading Day immediately following the
Record Date, in the case of a dividend or distribution, or the effective date
in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. If any such
event is declared but does not occur, the Conversion Rate shall be
readjusted, effective as of the date the Board announces that such event shall
not occur, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such event
had not been declared.

 

(2) the dividend, distribution or other issuance to all or substantially all
holders of Common Shares of rights (other than a distribution of rights
issued pursuant to a shareholders rights plan, to the extent such rights are
attached to Common Shares (in which event the provisions of Section 10(a)(5)
shall apply)), options or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or
purchase Common Shares for a period expiring sixty (60) days or less from the
date of issuance thereof, at a price per share that is less than the Market
Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date for such
issuance, in which event the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the
following formula:



   ![LOGO](g816161g33g48.jpg) 

where,

 

CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business
on the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance;

CR1 = the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately following the Close of
Business on the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance;

OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Close
of Business on the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance;

 

X = the total number of Common Shares issuable pursuant to such rights,
options or warrants; and

 

Y = the number of Common Shares equal to the aggregate price payable to
exercise such rights, options or warrants divided by the Market Price on the
Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date for such dividend,
distribution or issuance.

For purposes of this clause (2), in determining whether any rights, options
or warrants entitle the holders to purchase the Common Shares at a price per
share that is less than the Market Price on the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance, there
shall be taken into account any consideration the Corporation receives for
such rights, options or warrants, and any amount payable on exercise thereof,
with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be the fair
market value thereof (as determined in good faith by the Board).

 



14 Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (2) shall become effective
immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Trading Day immediately
following the Record Date for such dividend, distribution or issuance. In the
event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion
Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board publicly
announces its decision not to issue such rights, options or warrants, to the
Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution or
issuance had not been declared. To the extent that such rights, options or
warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or Common Shares are
otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights, options or warrants upon the
exercise of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be
readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the
adjustments made upon the dividend, distribution or issuance of such rights,
options or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number
of Common Shares actually delivered.

(3) the Corporation or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of
Common Shares pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Corporation
or a subsidiary of the Corporation for all or any portion of the Common
Shares, where the cash and value of any other consideration included in the
payment per Common Share validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Market
Price of the Common Shares on the Trading Day prior to the last day (the "
_Expiration Date_ ") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to
such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), in which event the
Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:



   ![LOGO](g816161g08i69.jpg) 

where,

 

CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business
on the Expiration Date;

CR1 = the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of
Business on the Expiration Date;

AC = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board), on the
Expiration Date, of the aggregate value of all cash and any other
consideration paid or payable for shares validly tendered or exchanged and not
withdrawn as of the Expiration Date (the " _Purchased Shares_ ");

 

OS1 = the number of Common Shares outstanding as of the last time tenders or
exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "
_Expiration Time_ "), excluding any Purchased Shares;

OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately before the
Expiration Time, including any Purchased Shares; and

 



15 SP1 = the arithmetic average of the VWAP (as defined below) for each of the
ten (10) consecutive full Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately
succeeding the Expiration Date.

 

Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (3) shall become effective
immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Trading Day immediately
following the Expiration Date. In the event that the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Shares pursuant to any such
tender offer or exchange offer but is permanently prevented by applicable law
from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then
the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would
then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.

 

(4) the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or
substantially all holders of its Common Shares (subject to an exception for
cash in lieu of fractional shares) shares of any class of Equity Securities
(other than Common Shares as covered by Section 10(a)(1)), evidences of its
indebtedness, cash, assets, other property or securities or rights, options
or warrants to acquire Equity Securities or other securities, but excluding
(A) dividends or distributions referred to in Section 10(a)(1) hereof, (B)
rights, options or warrants referred to in Section 10(a)(2) hereof or
distributed in connection with a shareholder rights plans (in which event the
provisions of Section 10(a)(5) to the extent applicable shall apply) and (C)
regular quarterly dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash in an
amount not to exceed US$0.06 per share, then, in each such case the Conversion
Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:



 

   ![LOGO](g816161g77s47.jpg) 

where,

 

CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business
on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;

CR1 = the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of
Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution;

SP0 = the Market Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record
Date for such dividend or distribution; and

 

C = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of the
portion of Distributed Property distributed with respect to each outstanding
Common Share on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; _provided_
, that, if C is equal to or greater than SP0, then in lieu of the foregoing
adjustment, the Corporation shall distribute to each holder of Series A First
Preferred Shares on the date the applicable Distributed Property is
distributed to holders of Common Shares, but without requiring such holder to
convert its Series A First Preferred Shares the amount of Distributed
Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of
Common Shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date fixed for
determination for shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. 

 



16 (5) If the Corporation has a shareholder rights plan in effect with respect
to the Common Shares on the Conversion Date, upon conversion of any Series A
First Preferred Shares, holders of such shares will receive, in addition to
the shares of Common Shares, the rights under such rights plan relating to
such Common Shares, unless, prior to the Conversion Date, the rights have (i)
become exercisable or (ii) separated from the Common Shares (the first of such
events to occur being the " _Trigger Event_ "), in either of which cases the
Conversion Rate will be adjusted, effective automatically at the time of such
Trigger Event, as if the Corporation had made a distribution of such rights to
all holders of the Common Shares as described in Section 10(a)(2) (without
giving effect to the 60-day limit on the exercisability of rights, options
and warrants ordinarily subject to such Section 10(a)(2)), subject to
appropriate readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or
redemption of such rights prior to the exercise, deemed exercise or exchange
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such shareholder
rights are exchanged by the Corporation for Common Shares, the Conversion Rate
shall be appropriately readjusted as if such shareholder rights had not been
issued, but the Corporation had instead issued the Common Shares issued upon
such exchange as a dividend or distribution of Common Shares subject to
Section 10(a)(1). Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph,
no adjustment shall be required to be made to the Conversion Rate with
respect to any holder of Series A First Preferred Shares which is, or is an
"affiliate" or "associate" of, an "acquiring person" under such
shareholder rights plans or with respect to any direct or indirect transferee
of such holder who receives Series A First Preferred Shares in such transfer
after the time such holder becomes, or its affiliate or associate becomes, an
"acquiring person."

(6) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the
Series A First Preferred Shares is outstanding, shall issue Common Shares or
any other security convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for Common
Shares (such Common Shares or other security, " _Equity-Linked Securities_ ")
(other than (i) an Excluded Issuance, (ii) Common Shares issued upon
conversion of the Series A First Preferred Shares and (iii) rights, options,
warrants or other distributions referred to in Sections 10(a)(2) and
10(a)(4)), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following
formula:



   ![LOGO](g816161g08w40.jpg) 

where,

 

CR0 = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such
Equity-Linked Securities;

 



17 CR1 = the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the issuance of
such Equity-Linked Securities;

AC = the aggregate consideration paid or payable for such Equity-Linked
Securities;

OS0 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately before the issuance
of Equity-Linked Securities;

OS1 = the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after the issuance
of Equity-Linked Securities and giving effect to any Common Shares issuable
upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Equity-Linked Securities; and

SP = the Market Price on the date of issuance of such Equity-Linked
Securities.

 

The adjustment shall become effective immediately after such issuance.

 

(b) _Calculation of Adjustments_. All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall
be calculated by the Corporation to the nearest 1/10,000th of one Common
Share (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower
1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required
unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least
one percent of the Conversion Rate; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
adjustment that is not required to be made will be carried forward and taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made
upon any Conversion Date.

(c) _When No Adjustment Required_. 

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, the Conversion Rate will
not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Shares or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares or carrying the right to
purchase any of the foregoing, or for the repurchase of Common Shares.

 

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, no adjustment of the
Conversion Rate shall be made as a result of the issuance of, the
distribution of separate certificates representing, the exercise or redemption
of, or the termination or invalidation of, rights pursuant to any shareholder
rights plans.

 

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall
be made:

 

(A) upon the issuance of any Common Shares or options or rights to purchase
such shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director, manager or
consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries or of any employee agreements or arrangements or programs;

 



18 (B) upon the issuance of any Common Shares pursuant to any option,
warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security
outstanding as of the Issue Date; or

(C) for accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A First Preferred Shares.

(d) _Successive Adjustments_. After an adjustment to the Conversion
Rate under this Section 9, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under
this Section 9 shall cause an adjustment to each such Conversion Rate as so
adjusted.

 

(e) _Multiple Adjustments_. For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs
that would trigger an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this
Section 10 under more than one subsection hereof (other than where holders of
Series A First Preferred Shares are entitled to elect the applicable
adjustment, in which case such election shall control), such event, to
the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result
in multiple adjustments hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that if more than
one subsection of this Section 10 is applicable to a single event, the
subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment.

(f) _Other Adjustments_. The Corporation may, but shall not be required
to, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required
by this Section 10, as the Board considers to be advisable in order to avoid
or diminish any income tax to any holders of Common Shares resulting from any
dividend or distribution of shares or issuance of rights or warrants to
purchase or subscribe for shares or from any event treated as such for income
tax purposes or for any other reason.

 

(g) _Notice of Adjustments_. Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as
provided under this Section 10, the Corporation shall as soon as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment
(or if the Corporation is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably
practicable after becoming so aware) or the date the Corporation makes
an adjustment pursuant to Section 10(f):

(1) compute the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate in accordance with
this Section 10 and prepare and transmit to the Conversion Agent an officers
certificate setting forth the applicable Conversion Rate, the method of
calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such
adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and

(2) provide a written notice to the holders of the Series A First Preferred
Shares of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail
setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the applicable Conversion
Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate.

 



19 (h) _Conversion Agent_. The Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under
any duty or responsibility to any holder of Series A First Preferred Shares
to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the
applicable Conversion Rate or with respect to the nature or extent or
calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method
employed in making the same. The Conversion Agent shall be fully authorized
and protected in relying on any officers certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 10(g) and any adjustment contained therein and the Conversion Agent
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it
has received such certificate. The Conversion Agent shall not be accountable
with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Common
Shares, or of any securities or property, that may at the time be issued or
delivered with respect to any Series A First Preferred Shares; and the
Conversion Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Conversion
Agent, if other than the Corporation, shall not be responsible for any
failure of the Corporation to issue, transfer or deliver any Common Shares
pursuant to the conversion of Series A First Preferred Shares or to comply
with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Corporation
contained in this Section 10\.

(i) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Common Shares will be delivered to the
holders of Series A First Preferred Shares upon conversion. In lieu of
fractional shares otherwise issuable, holders of Series A First Preferred
Shares will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of
Common Shares, multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Shares on the
Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date. In order to
determine whether the number of Common Shares to be delivered to a holder of
Series A First Preferred Shares upon the conversion of such holders Series A
First Preferred Shares will include a fractional share (in lieu of which cash
would be paid hereunder), such determination shall be based on the aggregate
number of Series A First Preferred Shares of such holder that are being
converted on any single Conversion Date.

(j) _Reorganization Events_. In the event of:

 

(1) any reclassification, statutory exchange, merger, consolidation or other
similar business combination of the Corporation with or into another Person,
in each case, pursuant to which the Common Shares (but not the Series A First
Preferred Shares) are changed or converted into, or exchanged for, cash,
securities or other property of the Corporation or another person; 

(2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or
substantially all the property and assets of the Corporation, in each case
pursuant to which the Common Shares (but not the Series A First Preferred
Shares) are converted into cash, securities or other property; or

 

(3) any statutory exchange of securities of the Corporation with another
Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or
reclassification, recapitalization or reorganization of the Common Shares (but
not the Series A First Preferred Shares) into other securities,

 



20  (each of which is referred to as a " _Reorganization Event_ ") each Series A
First Preferred Share outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization
Event will, without the consent of the holders of Series A First Preferred
Shares unless required under Section 6(c) and subject to Section 10(k), remain
outstanding but shall become convertible into, out of funds legally available
therefor, the number, kind and amount of securities, cash and other property
(the " _Exchange Property_ ") (without any interest on such Exchange Property
and without any right to dividends or distribution on such Exchange Property
which have a record date that is prior to the applicable Conversion Date)
that the holder of such Series A First Preferred Share would have received in
such Reorganization Event had such holder converted its Series A First
Preferred Shares into the applicable number of Common Shares immediately
prior to the effective date of the Reorganization Event, assuming that such
holder is not a Person with which the Corporation consolidated or into which
the Corporation merged or which merged into the Corporation or to which
such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "
_Constituent Person_ "), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent
such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Shares
held by Affiliates of a Constituent Person and non-Affiliates; _provided_ ,
that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable
upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each Common Share held
immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a
Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof, then for the purpose of this
Section 10(j), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property
receivable upon such Reorganization Event will be deemed to be the weighted
average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of
Common Shares.

(k) _Exchange Property Election_. In the event that the holders of Common
Shares have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received
in such Reorganization Event, the Exchange Property that the holders of Series
A First Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive shall be determined by
the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A First Preferred Shares
on or before the earlier of (i) the deadline for elections by holders of
Common Shares and (ii) two (2) Business Days before the anticipated effective
date of such Reorganization Event. The number of units of Exchange Property
for each Series A First Preferred Share converted following the effective date
of such Reorganization Event shall be determined from among the choices made
available to the holders of the Common Shares and based on the per share
amount as of the effective date of the Reorganization Event, determined as if
the references to "Common Shares" herein were to "units of Exchange
Property."

(l) _Successive Reorganization Events_. The above provisions of Section 10(j)
and Section 10(k) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events
and the provisions of this Section 10 shall apply to any shares in the capital
(or in the capital of any other issuer) received by the holders of the Common
Shares in any such Reorganization Event.

(m) _Reorganization Event Notice_. The Corporation (or any successor) shall,
no less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the occurrence of any
Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the holders of Series A First
Preferred Shares of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount
of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange
Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of
this Section 10\.

 



21 (n) _Reorganization Event Agreements_. The Corporation shall not enter into
any agreement for a transaction constituting a Reorganization Event unless
(i) such agreement provides for or does not interfere with or prevent (as
applicable) conversion of the Series A First Preferred Shares into the
Exchange Property in a manner that is consistent with and gives effect to
this Section 10, and (ii) to the extent that the Corporation is not the
surviving corporation in such Reorganization Event or will be dissolved in
connection with such Reorganization Event, proper provision shall be made in
the agreements governing such Reorganization Event for the conversion of the
Series A First Preferred Shares into shares of the Person surviving such
Reorganization Event or such other continuing entity in such Reorganization
Event, or in the case of a Reorganization Event described in Section 10(j)(2),
an exchange of Series A First Preferred Shares for the shares of the Person to
whom the Corporations assets are conveyed or transferred, having voting
powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights as nearly equal as possible to those provided herein.

 

(o) _Restriction on Adjustments and Transactions_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any of the transactions described in this Section 10 would
result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate such that the Series A First
Preferred Shares would be convertible in the aggregate into more than 19.90%
of the Common Shares outstanding on the Issue Date (subject to adjustment as
described in this Section 10), then the Company shall not effect such
transaction without first obtaining the written consent or affirmative vote at
a meeting called for that purpose by holders of Common Shares required by a
securities exchange on which the Common Shares are listed or admitted to
trading in order to permit the Series A First Preferred Shares to be
convertible into such number of Common Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any right of the Series A First Preferred Shares in these
Articles of Amalgamation may be waived by the written consent or affirmative
vote at a meeting called for that purpose by holders of at least two-thirds
(2/3) of the then outstanding shares of Series A First Preferred Shares,
voting separately as a series.

Section 11\. _Reservation of Shares_. The Corporation shall at all times when
the Series A First Preferred Shares shall be outstanding reserve and keep
available, free from preemptive rights, for issuance upon the conversion of
Series A First Preferred Shares, such number of its authorized but unissued
Common Shares as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the
conversion of all outstanding Series A First Preferred Shares. Prior to the
delivery of any securities which the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver
upon conversion of the Series A First Preferred Shares, the Corporation shall
comply with all applicable laws and regulations which require action to be
taken by the Corporation.

 

Section 12\. _Notices_. Any and all notices or other communications or
deliveries hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and
effective on the earliest of (i) the date of transmission, if such notice or
communication is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number specified in
this Section 12 prior to or at the Close of

 



22  Business on a Business Day and electronic confirmation of receipt is

the facsimile number specified in this Section on a day that is not a Business
Day or later than the Close of Business on any Business Day, (iii) the
Business Day following the date of mailing, if sent by a nationally
recognized overnight courier service, or (iv) upon actual receipt by the party
to whom such notice is required to be given. The addresses for such
communications shall be: (i) if to the Corporation, attention: Chief
Executive Officer and General Counsel, or (ii) if to a holder of Series A
First Preferred Shares, to the address or facsimile number appearing on the
Corporations shareholder records or such other address or facsimile number as
such holder may provide to the Corporation in accordance with this Section
12\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series A First Preferred Shares are
issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Corporation or any
similar facility, such notices may be given to the holders of the Series A
First Preferred Shares in any manner permitted by such facility.

SERIES B NON-CONVERTIBLE FIRST PREFERRED SHARES

 

Section 1\. _Authorized_. The Corporation shall be authorized to issue a
maximum of [ ] Series B non-convertible first preferred shares ("
_Series B First Preferred Shares_ "). Series B First Preferred Shares
redeemed, purchased, or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be
cancelled and not restored to the status of authorized but unissued Shares of
the series. The number of authorized Series B First Preferred Shares may be
increased or decreased by the approval of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Series B First Preferred Shares, voting as a separate series,
provided that there shall be no decrease in the number of authorized Series B
First Preferred Shares to a number less than the number of such series
then issued and outstanding.

Section 2\. _Currency_. All payments and distributions on Series B First
Preferred Shares or with respect thereto shall be made in United States
currency. All references herein to "$" or "dollars" refer to United States
currency.

 

Section 3\. _Ranking_.

 

(a) The Series B First Preferred Shares shall, with respect to the payment of
dividends and upon Liquidation rank senior to each other class or series of
shares of the Corporation (other than the Series A First Preferred Shares),
whether now outstanding or hereafter issued, including, without limitation,
the common shares of the Corporation (the " _Common Shares_ ") (all
such junior shares being referred to hereinafter collectively as " _Junior
Shares_ ").

(b) The Series B First Preferred Shares shall, with respect to the payment of
dividends and rights upon Liquidation rank equally with the Series A First
Preferred Shares of the Corporation, whether now outstanding or hereafter
issued.

 

Section 4\. _Dividends_.

 

(a) The holders of Series B First Preferred Shares shall be entitled to
receive a quarterly fixed cumulative dividend in an amount equal to
the applicable Dividend Rate (as defined herein) then in effect (the "
_Dividends_ ").

(b) Subject to applicable law, Dividends shall be declared and payable
quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year
(unless any such day is not a Business Day, in which event such Dividends
shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day, without accrual to the
actual payment date), commencing on [January 1, 2015]1 (each such payment date
being a " _Dividend Payment Date_ ," and the period from the Issue Date of
the Series B First Preferred Shares to the first Dividend Payment Date and
each such quarterly period thereafter being a " _Dividend Period_ "). The
amount of Dividends payable on the Series B First Preferred Shares for any
period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number
of days elapsed. Subject to Section 6(b)(7)(B) herein, such Dividends shall be
paid to holders of Series B First Preferred Shares before any dividends shall
be declared, set apart for or paid upon any Junior Shares.



   1  | _Note to Draft_ : First payment date after Issue Date. (c) Dividends, whether or not declared, shall begin to accrue and be
cumulative from the Issue Date and shall compound at the relevant rate on
each subsequent Dividend Payment Date ( _i.e._ , no Dividends shall accrue on
another Dividend unless and until any Dividend Payment Date for such other
Dividends has passed without such other Dividends having been paid on such
date, in which case Dividends will accrue on such unpaid Dividends). If the
Corporation does not pay any Dividend in full in cash on any scheduled
Dividend Payment Date, such Dividends will accrue at the then applicable
Dividend Rate plus an additional two and one half percent (2.5%) per annum of
the Redemption Value of each Series B First Preferred Share from such
scheduled Dividend Payment Date to the date that all accumulated Dividends on
the Series B First Preferred Shares have been paid in cash in full. Any
Dividends accrued and not paid in cash pursuant to this Section 4(c) on each
Dividend Payment Date shall be added to the Redemption Value until such
Dividends are paid in cash in full. For the avoidance of doubt, Dividends
shall accumulate whether or not in any Dividend Period there have been funds
of the Corporation legally available for the payment of such Dividends.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays
less than the total amount of Dividends then accumulated in cash, such cash
dividend payment shall be distributed pro rata among the holders of Series B
First Preferred Shares based upon the Redemption Value on the Series B First
Preferred Shares then held by each such holder. When Dividends are not paid in
full in cash, all Dividends paid in cash and any dividends paid in cash on
Series A First Preferred Shares shall be paid pro rata so that the amount of
Dividends paid in cash and any dividends on Series A First Preferred Shares
paid in cash shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio as
accumulated Dividends and accumulated dividends on Series A First Preferred
Shares bear to each other.

 

(e) All Dividends shall be paid in cash or accrued in accordance with Section
4(c).

 

(f) Dividends shall be payable to the holders of record of Series B First
Preferred Shares as they appear on the register of the Corporation at the
Close of Business on the relevant record date, which shall be not more than
thirty (30) days nor less than ten (10) days preceding the applicable Dividend
Payment Date.

 

Section 5\. _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_.

 

(a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation or any return of capital or other distribution of assets
of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs (each, a " _Liquidation_ "), the holders of Series B First Preferred
Shares shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Corporation or
proceeds thereof (whether capital or surplus) legally available therefor, an
amount per Series B First Preferred Share equal to the Redemption Value per
share, plus an amount equal to any Dividends accumulated but 

 



2  unpaid thereon (whether or not declared) through the date of Liquidation
(the " _Liquidation Preference_ "). Holders of Series B First Preferred Shares
will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they
have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 5(a) and will have
no right or claim to any of the Corporations remaining assets.

 

(b) If, in connection with any distribution described in Section 5(a) above,
the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay
in full the Liquidation Preference payable on the Series B First Preferred
Shares and the corresponding amounts payable on the Series A First Preferred
Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be paid pro rata
in accordance with the full respective amounts which would be payable on such
shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.

(c) For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, or the sale,
conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a Liquidation of the
Corporation.

Section 6\. _Voting Rights_ ; Consent Rights.

 

(a) The holders of Series B First Preferred Shares shall be entitled to notice
of all meetings at which holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to vote;
_provided_ , _however_ that, notwithstanding any such notice but subject to
Section 6(b) and without limiting any class voting rights pursuant to
applicable law, the holders of Series B First Preferred Shares shall not be
entitled to vote on any matter presented to the holders of Common Shares of
the Corporation for their action or consideration.

(b) In addition to, and not in substitution for, the rights and privileges
afforded to the holders of a class of issued shares under applicable law, for
so long as any Series B First Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the
Corporation shall not and shall not permit any direct or indirect Subsidiary
of the Corporation to, without first obtaining the written consent or
affirmative vote at a meeting called for that purpose by holders of at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of Series B First Preferred
Shares voting separately as a series, take any of the following actions:

(1) Any change, amendment, alteration or repeal (including, without
limitation, as a result of a merger, consolidation, or other similar or
extraordinary transaction) of any provisions of the Corporations Articles of
Amalgamation or By-laws that amends, modifies or adversely affects the
rights, preferences, privileges, conditions or voting powers of the Series B
First Preferred Shares;

 

(2) Any issuance or reclassification of shares of the Corporation (including,

Section 8\. _Redemption and Repurchase_.

 

(a) _Holder Redemption Election_. At any time after the date that is the nine
year anniversary of the Issue Date, each holder of outstanding Series B First
Preferred Shares shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to
cause the Corporation to redeem any or all of such holders outstanding Series
B First Preferred Shares by delivery to the Corporation of written notice
thereof (the " _Redemption Election_ "). Upon receipt of a Redemption Election
from a holder of Series B First Preferred Shares, the Corporation shall redeem
the number of outstanding Series B First Preferred Shares such holder has
elected to redeem pursuant to such Redemption Election at a redemption price
per share equal to (1) the sum of the Redemption Value per share of the Series
B First Preferred Shares to be redeemed plus (2) an amount equal to
any Dividends accumulated but unpaid thereon (whether or not declared) to but
excluding the date of redemption.

(b) _Corporation Redemption Election_. The Series B First Preferred Shares
may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time, at the option of the
Corporation, upon giving notice of redemption pursuant to Section 8(d), at a
redemption price per share equal to (1) the sum of the Redemption Value per
share of the Series B First Preferred Shares to be redeemed plus (2) an amount
equal to any Dividends accumulated but unpaid thereon (whether or not
declared) to but excluding the date of redemption. 

(c) _Repurchase at the Option of the Holder Upon a Change of Control_. Upon
the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series B First
Preferred Shares shall have the right to require the Corporation to
repurchase, by irrevocable written notice to the Corporation, all or any
portion of such holders Series B First Preferred Shares at a purchase price
per share equal to the sum of (1) the Redemption Value per share of the
Series B First Preferred Shares plus (2) an amount equal to accrued but unpaid
Dividends (whether or not declared) on such Series B First Preferred Shares to
but excluding the date of repurchase.

No earlier than sixty (60) days and no later than thirty (30) days prior to
the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Corporation shall send notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the
Series B First Preferred Shares at their respective last addresses appearing
on the books of the Corporation stating (1) that a Change of Control is
expected to occur, (2) the date that the Change of Control is expected to
occur, (3) that all Series B First Preferred Shares tendered prior to a
Business Day no earlier than thirty (30) days nor later than sixty (60) days
from the date such notice is mailed shall be accepted for repurchase and (4)
the procedures that holders

 



6  of the Series B First Preferred Shares must follow in order for their Series
B First Preferred Shares to be repurchased, including the place or places
where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the
repurchase price. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder
receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any
defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of Series B
First Preferred Shares designated for repurchase shall not affect the validity
of the proceedings for the repurchase of any other Series B First Preferred
Shares. The repurchase of Series B First Preferred Shares pursuant to this
Section 8(c) shall occur simultaneously with the consummation of the Change of
Control.

 

(d) _Notice of Redemption at the Option of the Corporation_. Notice of every
redemption of Series B First Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 8(b) shall
be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of
record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses
appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at
least thirty (30) days and not more than sixty (60) days before the date
fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 8(d) shall
be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder
receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any
defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of Series B
First Preferred Shares designated for redemption shall not affect the validity
of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Series B First Preferred
Shares. Each notice of redemption given to a holder shall state: (1) the
redemption date; (2) the number of the Series B First Preferred Shares to be
redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be
redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the
redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such
shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price in respect
of such shares.

(e) _Partial Redemption_. In case of any redemption of part of the Series B
First Preferred Shares at the time outstanding pursuant to this Section 8,
the shares to be redeemed shall be redeemed pro rata. Subject to the
provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to
prescribe the terms and conditions upon which the Series B First Preferred
Shares shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares
represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares without charge to the holder thereof.
Without limiting any remedies that may be available to any holder of Series B
First Preferred Shares, at law, in equity or otherwise, if on any date of
redemption, the Corporation does not have sufficient funds legally available
to redeem all of the outstanding Series B First Preferred Shares to be
redeemed on such date in accordance herewith, the Corporation shall redeem
only the number of such Series B First Preferred Shares that it has sufficient
funds to redeem with such amount to be apportioned on a pro rata basis among
the holders of such Series B First Preferred Shares, and the Corporation shall
redeem such Series B First Preferred Shares that are not redeemed on such
redemption date as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds
legally available therefor.

 



7 (f) _Effectiveness of Redemption_. If notice of redemption has been duly given
and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds
necessary for the redemption have been deposited by the Corporation, in trust
for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption,
with a bank or trust company doing business in the Borough of Manhattan, The
City of New York, and having a capital and surplus of at least US $1 billion
and selected by the Board, so as to be and continue to be available solely
therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called
for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the
redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for
redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed
outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such
redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank
or trust company, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of three
(3) years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so
called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the
redemption price of such shares.

Section 9\. _Notices_. Any and all notices or other communications or
deliveries hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and
effective on the earliest of (i) the date of transmission, if such notice or
communication is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number specified in
this Section 9 prior to or at the Close of Business on a Business Day and
electronic confirmation of receipt is received by the sender, (ii) the next
Business Day after the date of transmission, if such notice or communication
is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number specified in this Section
on a day that is not a Business Day or later than the Close of Business on any
Business Day, (iii) the Business Day following the date of mailing, if sent
by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, or (iv) upon actual
receipt by the party to whom such notice is required to be given. The
addresses for such communications shall be: (i) if to the
Corporation, attention: Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel, or (ii)
if to a holder of Series B First Preferred Shares, to the address or facsimile
number appearing on the Corporations shareholder records or such other
address or facsimile number as such holder may provide to the Corporation in
accordance with this Section 9\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series
B First Preferred Shares are issued in book-entry form through The Depository
Trust Corporation or any similar facility, such notices may be given to the
holders of the Series B First Preferred Shares in any manner permitted by such
facility.

2\. General; Securities Subject to this Agreement.

 

(a) Grant of Rights. The Company hereby grants registration rights to the
Designated Holders upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Registrable Securities. For the purposes of this Agreement, any
Registrable Securities held by any Designated Holder will cease to be
Registrable Securities, when (i) a Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities has been declared effective under the Securities Act by
the Commission and such Registrable Securities have been disposed of pursuant
to such effective Registration Statement, (ii) such Registrable Securities
are sold pursuant to Rule 144, (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (which may be waived by the Company in its sole
discretion), the entire amount of the Registrable Securities held by any

volume or manner of sale, and without any public information or other
requirement, pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, (iv)

which the transferors rights under this Agreement are not assigned to the
transferee of the securities.

(c) Holders of Registrable Securities. A Person is deemed to be a holder of
Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns of record Registrable
Securities. If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or
elections from two or more Persons with respect to the same Registrable
Securities, the Company may act upon the basis of the instructions, notice or
election received from the registered owner of such Registrable Securities.
Registrable Securities issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preferred
Shares shall be deemed outstanding for the purposes of this Agreement.

 



6 (d) Transfer of Registration Rights.

 

(i) Each Designated Holder may transfer or pledge Registrable Securities, or
the securities convertible into such Registrable Securities, with the
associated registration rights under this Agreement (including transfers
occurring by operation of law or by reason of intestacy) to a Permitted
Assignee or a pledgee (" _Pledgee_ ") only if (1) such Permitted Assignee
or Pledgee agrees in writing to be bound as a Designated Holder by the
provisions of this Agreement, such agreement being substantially in the form
of _Annex A_ hereto, and (2) (A) immediately following such transfer or
pledge, such Registrable Securities (including Registrable Securities
issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Shares) continue to
constitute Registrable Securities as held by such Permitted Assignee or
Pledgee or (B) such Permitted Assignee, together with its Affiliates,
beneficially owns Registrable Securities representing more than 1% of the
Common Shares as of the date of such transfer (counting any Registrable
Securities so owned that are Convertible Preferred Shares on an as-converted
basis as though immediately convertible). Upon any transfer or pledge of
Registrable Securities or the securities convertible into such Registrable
Securities other than as set forth in this Section 2(d), such securities shall
no longer constitute Registrable Securities (or securities convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable for Registrable Securities, as applicable).

 

(ii) Subject to Section 2(b) hereof, if a Designated Holder (including,
without limitation, a Crestview Holder) assigns its rights under this
Agreement in connection with the transfer of less than all of its Registrable
Securities, the Designated Holder shall retain its rights under this Agreement
with respect to its remaining Registrable Securities. If a Designated
Holder (including, without limitation, a Crestview Holder) assigns its rights
under this Agreement in connection with the transfer of all of its Registrable
Securities, such Designated Holder shall have no further rights or obligations
under this Agreement, except under Section 9 hereof in respect of offerings
in which it participated or registrations in which Registrable Securities held
by such Designated Holder were included.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary,
solely for purposes of the priorities for inclusion of Registrable Securities
in an underwritten offering as set forth in Sections 3(e), 4(a) and 5(b), as
such priorities are applicable to a Permitted Assignee, only the Registrable
Securities transferred to such Permitted Assignee shall be treated
as Registrable Securities held by a Designated Holder.

3\. Demand Registration.

 

(a) Request for Demand Registration. To the extent permitted by applicable law
and regulations, and subject to Section 6 hereof on up to a maximum of two
occasions, at any time on or after the first anniversary of the date hereof,
any Crestview Holder (in each case, a " _Demand Initiating Holder_ ") may make
a written request to the Company to register, and the Company shall register,
under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to a Registration Statement on
Form S-4 or S-8), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (a " _Demand
Registration_ "), the number of Registrable Securities stated in such request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect (i)
a Demand Registration if the Demand Initiating Holders, together with the
Designated Holders (other than the Demand Initiating Holders) that have
requested to register securities in such registration statement pursuant to
Section 3(b), propose to sell Registrable Securities having aggregate
Face Value (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) of less than
$30,000,000, and (ii) any Demand Registration within the Specified Period (or
such shorter period as the Company may determine in its sole discretion) after
the effective date of any other Registration Statement of the Company

 



7  (other than a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that a Demand Registration shall be deemed not to have been
effected if (i) after it has become effective, such registration statement is
interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of
the Commission or other governmental authority for any reason other than a
misrepresentation or an omission by a Designated Holder affiliated with the
Demand Initiating Holder, (ii) the registration statement does not remain
effective for the period specified in Section 3(c), or (iii) in the event of
an underwritten offering, if the conditions to closing specified in the
purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in connection with
such registration are not satisfied or waived other than by reason of some
wrongful act or omission by a Designated Holder affiliated with the Demand
Initiating Holder. In addition, if (1) the Board of Directors, in its good
faith judgment, determines that any registration of Registrable Securities
should not be made or continued because it would materially impede, delay or
interfere with any proposed financing, offer and sale of securities,
acquisition, merger, tender offer, business combination, corporate
reorganization, material operational development or other significant
transaction involving the Company or because such registration would require
the Company to disclose material nonpublic information that would not
otherwise be required to be disclosed under applicable law, and (2)
the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving the
confidentiality of such proposed transaction or information (a " _Valid
Business Reason_ "), (x) the Company may postpone filing a Registration
Statement (but not the preparation of the Registration Statement) relating to
a Demand Registration until such Valid Business Reason no longer exists or, if
later, the occurrence of the Valid Business Reason (but in no event may the
duration of such postponement last for more than 45 days after the date when
the Demand Registration was requested), and (y) in case a Registration
Statement has been filed relating to a Demand Registration, the Company may
postpone amending or supplementing such Registration Statement (in which
case, if the Valid Business Reason no longer exists or if more than 45 days
have passed since such postponement, the Demand Initiating Holder may request
a new Demand Registration (which request shall not be counted as
an additional Demand Registration for purposes of this Section 3(a)) or
request the prompt amendment or supplement of such Registration Statement).
The Company shall give written notice to the Demand Initiating Holder of each
of its determination to postpone filing, amending or supplementing a
Registration Statement, and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for
such postponement no longer exists or has occurred, as applicable, in each
case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company may not postpone a filing, amendment or
supplement under this Section 3(a) due to a Valid Business Reason for more
than 90 days in any 12-month period. Each request for a Demand Registration
by the Demand Initiating Holder shall state the type and amount of the
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the intended method of
disposition thereof, which may include a distribution of Registrable
Securities to, and resale of such Registrable Securities by, the equity
holders of any Crestview Holder or its equity holders (a " _Partner
Distribution_ "). The Demand Registration may be a shelf registration pursuant
to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, in which case the
provisions of Section 5(f) shall apply.

(b) Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Rights with Respect to a Demand Registration.
Subject to Section 4(b), any Designated Holder that has not requested a
registration under Section 3(a) hereof may, pursuant to this Section 3(b),
offer its Registrable Securities under any Demand Registration. The Company
shall (i) subject to clause (ii) below, as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than ten Business Days after the receipt of a request for a

 



8  Demand Registration from a Demand Initiating Holder give written notice
thereof to all of the Designated Holders (other than such Demand Initiating
Holder), which notice shall specify the type and number of Registrable
Securities subject to the request for Demand Registration and the intended
method of disposition of such Registrable Securities, (ii) in the case of a
postponement due to a Valid Business Reason pursuant to Section 3(a), provide
the notice specified in clause (i) above no later than 10 Business Days prior
to the anticipated expiration of the postponement period, and (iii) subject to
Section 3(e) hereof, include in the Registration Statement filed pursuant to
the Demand Registration all of the Registrable Securities held by such
Designated Holders from whom the Company has received a written request for
inclusion therein within five Business Days of the date on which the Company
has given the written notice referred to in clause (i) above. Each such
request by such Designated Holder shall specify the type and number of
Registrable Securities proposed to be registered. The failure of any
Designated Holder to respond within the five Business Day period referred to
in clause (ii) above shall be deemed to be a waiver of such Designated
Holders rights under this Section 3(b) with respect to such Demand
Registration. Any Designated Holder may waive its rights under this Section
3(b) by giving written notice to the Company.

(c) Effective Demand Registration. Subject to Section 3(a), the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account, among other
things, accounting and regulatory matters) to file a Registration Statement
relating to the Demand Registration and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be filed within 45 days of
receipt of a Demand Registration and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
request that the Registration Statement become effective as soon
as practicable but in no event later than 90 days after it files the
Registration Statement and to remain continuously effective for the lesser of
(i) the period during which all Registrable Securities registered in the
Demand Registration are sold or (ii) 120 days (or in the case of a shelf
registration, three years from the effective date of the applicable shelf
registration; _provided that_ , if during such three year period the Company
shall no longer be eligible to use a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or
any successor form), the Company shall maintain a shelf registration for a
period of two years from the effective date of the applicable registration
statement.

 

(d) Expenses. Except as provided in Section 3(g) or 8(d) hereof, the Company
shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with a Demand Registration,
including all Registration Expenses relating to the registration of
Registrable Securities included in any such Demand Registration pursuant to
Section 3(b), whether or not such Demand Registration becomes effective.

 

(e) Underwriting Procedures. If the applicable Demand Initiating Holder so
elects, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the offering made pursuant to such Demand Registration pursuant to this
Section 3 to be in the form of a firm commitment underwritten public offering
and the managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering shall
be the Approved Underwriter selected in accordance with Section 3(f) hereof.
In connection with any Demand Registration under this Section 3 involving an
underwritten offering, none of the Registrable Securities held by a Designated
Holder making a request for inclusion of such Registrable Securities pursuant
to Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof shall be included in such underwritten offering
unless such Designated Holder accepts the terms of the

 



9  offering as agreed upon by the Company, the Demand Initiating Holder and the
Approved Underwriter (including, without limitation, offering price,
underwriting commissions or discounts and lockup agreement terms, subject to
Section 7(a)), and then only in such quantity as set forth below. If the
Approved Underwriter advises the Company in good faith that the aggregate
amount of such Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the
distribution or sales price of the Registrable Securities in such offering,
then the Company shall include in such Demand Registration, to the extent of
the amount that the Approved Underwriter believes may be sold without causing
such material adverse effect, _first_ , such number of Registrable Securities
of the Designated Holders that are participating in such offering pursuant to
Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof, which Registrable Securities shall be allocated
pro rata among the Designated Holders participating in the offering, based on
the aggregate number of Registrable Securities held by each such Designated
Holder, and _second_ , securities offered by the Company for its own account.

(f) Selection of Underwriters. If any Demand Registration, S-3 Registration
or Shelf Take-Down, as the case may be, of Registrable Securities is in the
form of an underwritten public offering, the Demand Initiating Holder or S-3
Initiating Holder, as applicable, for such registration or Shelf Take-Down
shall select and obtain one or more investment banking firms of national or
regional reputation to act as the managing underwriter or underwriters of the
offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that such firm or firms shall, in any case,
also be approved by the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. An investment banking firm or firms selected
pursuant to this Section 3(f) shall be referred to as the " _Approved
Underwriter_ " herein.

 

(g) Withdrawal. The Demand Initiating Holder shall be entitled to withdraw or
revoke its request for a Demand Registration without the prior written
consent of the Company if (i) such withdrawal or revocation is as a result of
facts or circumstances arising after the date on which a request for a Demand
Registration was made and the Demand Initiating Holder reasonably
determines that participation in such registration would have a material
adverse effect on the Demand Initiating Holder, (ii) the Closing Price is more
than fifteen percent lower than the Closing Price on the date the Demand
Initiating Holder requested such Demand Registration or (iii) such Demand
Initiating Holder agrees to pay all fees and expenses incurred by the Company
in connection with such withdrawn registration (each, a " _Permitted
Withdrawal_ "). Any Permitted Withdrawal shall constitute and effect an
automatic withdrawal by any other Designated Holder participating in such
Demand Registration pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof.

 

(h) Partner Distributions. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Company shall, at the request of any Crestview Holders seeking
to effect a Partner Distribution, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
file any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendments and shall
otherwise take action reasonably necessary to include such language, if such
language was not included in the initial Registration Statement, or revise
such language if deemed necessary by such Crestview Holder, to effect such
Partner Distribution (including adding one or more selling equityholders to
the registration statement through a prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment, as reasonably necessary or required).

 



10 4\. Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Registration.

 

(a) Request for Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Registration. If the Company
proposes to file a Registration Statement, that will become effective at any
time on or after the first anniversary of the date hereof, with respect to an
offering by the Company of Common Shares or any class of security convertible
into Common Shares for its own account (other than a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 or S-8) or for the account of any shareholder of the
Company (other than Designated Holders pursuant to Sections 3 and 5 hereof),
then the Company shall give written notice (an " _Incidental Registration
Notice_ ") of such proposed filing to each of the Designated Holders at least
five Business Days before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall
describe the proposed registration and distribution and, subject to Section
4(b), offer such Designated Holders the opportunity to register the number of
Registrable Securities that each such Designated Holder may request (an "
_Incidental Registration_ "). Any such request by a Designated Holder must be
made in writing and received by the Company within five Business Days of the
date on which the Company has given the Incidental Registration Notice. The
failure of any Designated Holder to respond to an Incidental Registration
Notice within five Business Days shall be deemed a waiver of such Designated
Holders rights under this Section 4(a) with respect to such Incidental
Registration. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the managing underwriter or underwriters in the case of a proposed
underwritten offering (the " _Company Underwriter_ ") to permit each
Designated Holder who has requested in writing to participate in the
Incidental Registration pursuant to this Section 4(a) to include the number of
such Designated Holders Registrable Securities indicated by such Designated
Holder in such offering on the same terms and conditions as the Common Shares
or class of security convertible into Common Shares, as applicable, for the
account of the Company or the account of such other equityholder, as the case
may be, included therein. Any withdrawal of the Registration Statement by
the Company for any reason shall constitute and effect an automatic
withdrawal of any Incidental Registration related thereto. In connection with
any Incidental Registration under this Section 4(a) involving an underwritten
offering, the Company shall not be required to include any Registrable
Securities held by a Designated Holder in such underwritten offering unless
such Designated Holder accepts the terms of the underwritten offering as
agreed upon between the Company, such other equityholders, if any, and the
Company Underwriter (including, without limitation, offering price,
underwriting commissions or discounts and lockup agreement terms, subject to
Section 7(a)), and then only in such quantity as set forth below. If the
Company Underwriter advises the Company in good faith that the aggregate
amount of the securities requested to be included in such offering is
sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the distribution or
sales price of the securities in such offering, then the Company shall
include in such Incidental Registration, to the extent of the amount that the
Company Underwriter believes may be sold without causing such material adverse
effect: (i) in the case of a Company initiated Incidental Registration,
_first_ (x) all of the securities to be offered for the account of the
Company, and _second_ (y) any Registrable Securities that are participating in
such offering pursuant to this Section 4(a), which Registrable Securities
shall be allocated pro rata among the Designated Holders participating in the
offering, based on the aggregate number of Registrable Securities held by each
such Designated Holder, except to the extent any such holders have agreed
under existing agreements to which the Company is a signatory to grant
priority with regard to participation in such offering to any other holders of
securities of the Company, and (ii) in the case of an Incidental Registration
initiated by equityholders of the Company (including any

 



11  Designated Holder), _first_ , (A) any Registrable Securities requested by
holders thereof, pro rata among the Designated Holders and such other holders
based on the number of securities held by each such holder, and _second_ ,
(B) all of the securities to be offered for the account of the Company.

(b) Expenses. Except as provided in Section 8(d) hereof, the Company shall
bear all Registration Expenses in connection with any Incidental Registration
pursuant to this Section 4, whether or not such Incidental Registration
becomes effective.

 

5\. Form S-3 Registration.

(a) Request for a Form S-3 Registration. At any time, on or after the first
anniversary of the date hereof, at which the Company is eligible for use of
Form S-3 under the Securities Act in connection with a secondary public
offering of Registrable Securities, in the event that the Company shall
receive from any Crestview Holder (the " _S-3 Initiating Holder_ "), shall be
entitled under this Section 5to make on behalf of all Crestview Holders and
Designated Holders, subject to Section 6 hereof, on up to a maximum of four
occasions, a written request that the Company register under the Securities
Act on Form S-3 (or any successor form) (an " _S-3 Registration_") the sale of
all or a portion of the Registrable Securities owned by such S-3
Initiating Holder (which S-3 Registration may be a shelf registration
pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, in which case the
provisions of Section 5(f) shall apply), the Company shall give written
notice of such request to all of the other Designated Holders (other than such
S-3 Initiating Holder) as promptly as practicable but in no event later than
five Business Days before the anticipated filing date of such Form S-3, which
notice shall describe the proposed registration, the intended method of
disposition of such Registrable Securities and any other information that at
the time would be appropriate to include in such notice, and offer such other
Designated Holders the opportunity to register the number of Registrable
Securities as each such Designated Holder may request in writing to the
Company, given within five Business Days of the date on which the Company has
given the written notice of such registration; _provided that_ , an S-3
Registration shall be deemed not to have been effected if (i) after it has
become effective, such registration statement is interfered with by any
stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission or
other governmental authority for any reason other than a misrepresentation or
an omission by a Designated Holder affiliated with the S-3 Initiating Holder,
(ii) the registration statement does not remain effective for the period
specified in Section 8(a)(ii), or (iii) in the event of an underwritten
offering, if the conditions to closing specified in the purchase agreement or
underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such registration are
not satisfied or waived other than by reason of some wrongful act or omission
by a Designated Holder affiliated with the S-3 Initiating Holder. Each request
for an S-3 Registration by an S-3 Initiating Holder shall state the type and
number of the Registrable Securities proposed to be registered and the
intended method of disposition thereof. With respect to each S-3 Registration,
the Company shall, subject to Section 5(b) hereof, (A) include in such
offering the Registrable Securities of the S-3 Initiating Holder and the
Designated Holders who have requested in writing to participate in such
registration on the same terms and conditions as the Registrable Securities
of the S-3 Initiating Holder included therein (collectively, the " _S-3
Participating Holders_") and (B) file a Registration Statement on Form
S-3 (or any successor form) relating to the S-3 Registration and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be
filed within 45 days of receipt of an S-3

 



12  Registration request and to use commercially reasonable efforts to request
that the Registration Statement become effective as soon as practicable, but
not later than 90 days after it files the Registration Statement on Form S-3;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect an
S-3 Registration if the S-3 Initiating Holders, together with the Designated
Holders (other than the S-3 Initiating Holders) that have requested to
register securities in such registration statement pursuant to this Section
5(a), propose to sell Registrable Securities having aggregate Face Value (as
such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) of less than $20,000,000.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, immediately upon determination of the price at
which such Registrable Securities are to be sold in an S-3 Registration that
is a firm commitment underwritten public offering, if such price is below
the price which the S-3 Initiating Holder finds acceptable, the S-3
Initiating Holder for the S-3 Registration shall then have the right, by
written notice to the Company, to withdraw its Registrable Securities from
being included in such offering; _provided_ , that such a withdrawal by the
S-3 Initiating Holder shall constitute and effect an automatic withdrawal by
all other S-3 Participating Holders, but shall represent the use of an
underwritten public offering under Section 6\. If the S-3 Initiating Holder
requests, and if the Company is a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer, the Company
shall cause such S-3 Registration to be made pursuant to an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement and, if requested, may omit the names of the S-3
Participating Holders and the amount of the Registrable Securities to be
offered thereunder. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to be and remain eligible to use Form S-3 for registration of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to Rule 415 at all times on and after the date of this
Agreement until the date upon which there ceases to be outstanding any
Registrable Securities.

(b) Form S-3 Underwriting Procedures. If the S-3 Initiating Holder so elects,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such S-3
Registration pursuant to this Section 5 to be in the form of a firm
commitment underwritten public offering and the managing underwriter or
underwriters selected for such offering shall be the Approved Underwriter
selected in accordance with Section 3(f) hereof. In connection with any S-3
Registration under this Section 5 involving an underwritten public offering,
none of the Registrable Securities held by a Designated Holder making a
request for inclusion of such Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 5(a)
hereof shall be included in such underwritten offering unless such Designated
Holder accepts the terms of the offering as agreed upon by the Company, the
S-3 Initiating Holder and the Approved Underwriter (including, without
limitation, offering price, underwriting commissions and discounts and lockup
agreement terms, subject to Section 8(a)) and then only in such quantity as
set forth below.

 

If the Approved Underwriter advises the Company in good faith that the
aggregate amount of such Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the
distribution or sales price of the Registrable Securities in such offering,
then the Company shall include in such offering, to the extent of the amount
that the Approved Underwriter believes may be sold without causing such
material adverse effect, _first_ , such number of Registrable Securities of
the Designated Holders participating in the offering under Section 5(a)
hereof, which Registrable Securities shall be allocated pro rata among such
Designated Holders participating in the offering, based on the number of
Registrable Securities held by each such Designated Holder, and _second_ ,
securities offered by the Company for its own account.

 



13 (c) Limitations on Form S-3 Registrations. If the Board of Directors, in its
good faith judgment, determines that a Valid Business Reason exists, (x) the
Company may postpone filing a Registration Statement relating to an S-3
Registration (but not the preparation of the Registration Statement) until
such Valid Business Reason no longer exists or, if later, the occurrence of
the Valid Business Reason (but in no event may the duration of such
postponement last for more than 45 days after the date when the S-3
Registration was requested), and (y) in case a Registration Statement has been
filed relating to an S-3 Registration, the Company may postpone amending or
supplementing such Registration Statement (in which case, if the Valid
Business Reason no longer exists or if more than 45 days have passed since
such postponement, the S-3 Initiating Holder may request the prompt amendment
or supplement of such Registration Statement or a new S-3 Registration). The
Company shall give written notice to the S-3 Initiating Holder of each of its
determination to postpone or delay amending or supplementing a Registration
Statement and of the fact that a Valid Business Reason for such postponement
or delay no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Company may not postpone a filing or delay amending or supplementing a filing
under this Section 5(c) due to a Valid Business Reason for more than 90 days
in any 12-month period. In addition, the Company shall not be required to
effect any registration at the request of any Designated Holder pursuant
to Section 5(a) hereof (i) within the Specified Period after the effective
date of any other Registration Statement of the Company relating to any
underwritten public offering in which any of such Designated Holders
Registrable Securities were included (other than a Registration Statement on
Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form thereto) or after an Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down, or (ii) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the S-3
Initiating Holder.

(d) Expenses. Except as provided in Section 8(d) hereof, the Company shall
bear all Registration Expenses in connection with any S-3 Registration
pursuant to this Section 5, whether or not such S-3 Registration becomes
effective.

(e) Automatic Shelf Registration Statement. After the Registration Statement
with respect to an S-3 Registration that is an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement becomes effective, upon written request by the S-3 Initiating Holder
for the S-3 Registration, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after
receiving such request, (i) file with the Commission a prospectus supplement
naming the S-3 Participating Holders as selling shareholders and the amount of
Registrable Securities to be offered and include, to the extent not included
or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any other
information omitted from the Prospectus used in connection with such
Registration Statement as permitted by Rule 430B promulgated under the
Securities Act (including the plan of distribution and the names of any
underwriters, placement agents or brokers) and (ii) pay any necessary filing
fees to the Commission within the time period required.

 

(f) Shelf Registration Statement. (i) The S-3 Initiating Holder for an S-3
Registration that provides for offers and sales of Registrable Securities on
a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act (a "
_Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement_") may initiate an offering or sale of
all or part of such Registrable Securities (a " _Shelf Take-Down_ "). The
Company shall cause a Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement covering all of
the Registrable Securities to be effective on or before the first anniversary
of the date hereof, and each Crestview Holder shall be deemed to be an S-3
Initiating Holder for such S-3 Registration. The provisions of this Section
5(f) shall apply to any Shelf Take-Down.

 



14 (ii) If an S-3 Initiating Holder so elects in a written request delivered to
the Company (an " _Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice_ "), a Shelf Take-Down
may be in the form of an underwritten public offering (an " _Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down_ ") and, subject to the limitations set forth in the proviso
to Section 5(a), the Company shall file and effect an amendment or supplement
to its Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement for such purpose as soon as
practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated
to effect a Underwritten Shelf Take-Down if the S-3 Initiating Holders,
together with the Designated Holders (other than the S-3 Initiating Holders)
that have requested inclusion in such Shelf Take-Down pursuant to this
Section 5(f), propose to sell Registrable Securities having aggregate Face
Value (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) of less than
$20,000,000. The S-3 Initiating Holder shall indicate in such Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down Notice whether it intends for such Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down to involve a customary "road show" (including an "electronic road show")
by the underwriters (a " _Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ ").
Upon receipt of an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice indicating that such
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down will be a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down,
the Company shall promptly (but in any event no later than ten Business Days
prior to the expected date of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down)
give written notice of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to all other
S-3 Participating Holders and shall permit the participation of all such S-3
Participating Holders that request inclusion in such Marketed Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down who respond in writing within ten Business Days after the
receipt of such notice of their election to participate. The provisions of
Section 5(b) (other than the first sentence thereof) shall apply with respect
to the right of the S-3 Initiating Holder and any other S-3 Participating
Holder to participate in any Underwritten Shelf Take-Down.

 

(iii) If the S-3 Initiating Holder desires to effect a Shelf Take-Down that
does not constitute a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (a " _Non-
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ "), the S-3 Initiating Holder shall so
indicate in a written request delivered to the Company no later than two
Business Days prior to the expected date of such Non-Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, which request shall include (i) the total
number of Registrable Securities expected to be offered and sold in such Non-
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, (ii) the expected plan of distribution
of such Non-Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down and (iii) the action or
actions required (including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (including the delivery of one or more
stock certificates representing shares of Registrable Securities to be sold
in such Non-Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down), and, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 5(a), the Company shall file and effect an
amendment or supplement to its Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement for such
purpose as soon as practicable.

6\. Maximum Number of Underwritten Registrations.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall the
aggregate number of underwritten public offerings under Sections 3 and 5 be
greater than four.

 



15 7\. Holdback Agreements.

 

(a) Restrictions on Public Sale by Designated Holders.

 

(i) To the extent requested by the Approved Underwriter or the Company
Underwriter, as the case may be, in the case of an underwritten
public offering, such Designated Holder agrees (x) not to effect any public
sale or distribution of any Registrable Securities or of any securities
convertible into or exercisable for such Registrable Securities, including a
sale pursuant to Rule 144 (or any successor rule or regulation) promulgated
under the Securities Act, or offer to sell, contract to sell (including,
without limitation, any short sale), grant any option to purchase or enter
into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a
sale of, any Registrable Securities and (y) except as otherwise consented to
by the Company, not to make any request for a Demand Registration or
S-3 Registration under this Agreement, in each case, during the Specified
Period, except in each case as part of such underwritten public offering.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any Designated Holder that does not have
Registrable Securities included in an underwritten offering shall not be
subject to the foregoing obligations under this Section 7(a)(i) unless all of
the executive officers and directors of the Company and all of the other
Designated Holders are subject to the same obligations, and (B) any
discretionary waiver or termination of any Lock-up Agreement applicable to any
of the Companys executive officers or directors or Designated Holders shall
apply to the Crestview Holders and any Permitted Assignees thereof to which
his rights hereunder are assigned pursuant to Section 2(d) hereof, pro rata
based upon the number of shares subject to such obligations. To the extent
that any Designated Holder does not hold any Registrable Securities, then the
provisions of this Section 7(a)(i) shall not apply to such Designated Holder.

(ii) To the extent that any Designated Holder enters into a Lock-Up Agreement
in connection with an underwritten offering, such Lock-Up Agreement shall
supersede the terms of Section 7(a)(i) with respect to such Designated Holder.

 

(iii) The Designated Holders hereby agree that they shall act in good faith
with respect to the restrictions set forth in this Section 7(a) and shall
take no action or omit to take any action with the intention of circumventing
or evading the restrictions applicable to them under this 7(a).

 

8\. Registration Procedures.

(a) Obligations of the Company. Whenever registration of Registrable
Securities has been requested or required pursuant to Section 3, Section 4 or
Section 5 hereof, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the registration and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance
with the intended method of distribution thereof as quickly as practicable,
and in connection with any such request, the Company shall:

 

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account, among other
things, accounting and regulatory matters) to, as expeditiously as
practicable, prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement on
any form for which the Company then qualifies or which counsel for the Company
shall deem appropriate and

 



16  which form shall be available for the sale of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof, and cause such
Registration Statement to become effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or
supplements thereto (including, without limitation, any documents incorporated
by reference therein), or before using any Free Writing Prospectus, the
Company shall provide one firm of legal counsel selected by the Designated
Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities being registered in
such registration (" _Designated Holders  Counsel_"), any managing
underwriter or broker/dealer participating in any disposition of such
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and any attorney
retained by any such managing underwriter or broker/dealer (each, an "
_Inspector_ " and collectively, the " _Inspectors_ ") with an opportunity to
review and comment on such Registration Statement and each Prospectus included
therein (and each amendment or supplement thereto) and each Free Writing
Prospectus to be filed with the Commission, subject to such documents being
under the Companys control, and (y) the Company shall notify the Designated
Holders Counsel and each seller of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement of any stop order issued or threatened by the
Commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of
such stop order or to remove it if entered; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall not include any information relating to a Designated Holder in
any such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto (including such documents that, upon filing, would be incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) to which such Designated
Holder shall object, in writing, on a timely basis, unless, in the opinion of
the Company, the inclusion of such information is necessary to comply with
applicable law or regulation;

 

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as expeditiously as
practicable, prepare and file with the Commission such amendments
and supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective for the lesser of (x) 120 days (or, in the case of a shelf
registration statement, three years from the effective date of the applicable
Registration Statement); _provided that_ , if during such three year period
the Company shall no longer be eligible to use a Registration Statement on
Form S-3 (or any successor form), the Company shall maintain a shelf
registration for a period of two years from the effective date of the
applicable registration statement, and (y) such shorter period that will
terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such Registration Statement
or otherwise no longer constitute Registrable Securities; and comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such Registration Statement during such period in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set
forth in such Registration Statement;

 

(iii) as expeditiously as practicable, furnish to each seller of Registrable
Securities such number of copies of such Registration Statement, each
amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits
thereto), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including
each preliminary Prospectus), any Prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
Securities Act and any Free Writing Prospectus as each such seller may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities owned by such seller;

 



17 (iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as expeditiously as
practicable, register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any seller of
Registrable Securities may reasonably request, and continue such registration
or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction for as long as permissible
pursuant to the laws of such jurisdiction, or for as long as any such seller
requests or until all of such Registrable Securities are sold, whichever is
shortest, and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to enable any such seller to consummate the disposition
in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (x)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 8(a)(iv), (y) subject
itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z) consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction;

(v) as expeditiously as practicable, notify each seller of Registrable
Securities: (A) when a Prospectus, any Prospectus supplement, any Free
Writing Prospectus, a Registration Statement or a post-effective amendment to
a Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission, and, with respect
to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same
has become effective; (B) of any request by the Commission or any other
federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a
Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or for
additional information; (C) of the receipt by the Company of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from
qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for such
purpose; and (D) of the existence of any fact or happening of any event which
makes any statement of a material fact in such Registration Statement, related
Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed
to be incorporated therein by reference untrue or which would require the
making of any changes in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free
Writing Prospectus in order that, in the case of the Registration Statement,
it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of such Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading;

(vi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as expeditiously as
practicable, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section
8(a)(v)(D) hereof or, subject to Sections 3(a) and 5(c) hereof, the existence
of a Valid Business Reason, prepare a supplement or amendment to such
Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus and
furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities a reasonable number of copies
of such supplement to, or amendment of, such Registration Statement,
Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus as may be necessary so that, after
delivery to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, in the case of the
Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case
of such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

 



18 (vii) enter into and perform customary agreements (including an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Approved Underwriter or Company
Underwriter, if any, selected as provided in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5
hereof, as the case may be) and take such other commercially reasonable
actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities, including making such
representations and warranties to the holders of such Registrable Securities
and the underwriters participating in the offering, with respect to the
business of the Company, the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents,
if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, in
each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers
in underwritten offerings, and shall provide all reasonable cooperation,
including causing its appropriate officers to attend and participate in "road
shows" and other information meetings organized by the Approved Underwriter or
Company Underwriter, if and as applicable, and causing counsel to the Company
to deliver customary legal opinions in connection with any such underwriting
agreements;

 

(viii) make available at reasonable times for inspection by any Inspector all
financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of
the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Records_ ") as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Companys and its subsidiaries officers,
directors and employees, and the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm, to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
Inspector in connection with such Registration Statement. Records that the
Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies
the Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the Inspectors (and
the Inspectors shall confirm their agreement in writing in advance to the
Company if the Company shall so request) unless (x) the disclosure of such
Records is necessary, in the Companys judgment, to avoid or correct a
misstatement or omission in the Registration Statement, (y) the release of
such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of
competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom or (z) the
information in such Records was known to the Inspectors on a non-confidential
basis prior to its disclosure by the Company or has been made generally
available to the public. Each Inspector agrees that it shall, upon learning
that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, promptly give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at
the Companys expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure
of the Records deemed confidential. In the event that the Company is
unsuccessful in preventing the disclosure of such Records, such Inspector
agrees that it shall furnish only such portion of those Records that it is
advised by counsel is legally required and shall exercise all reasonable
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to those Records;

 

(ix) if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten public offering, obtain a
"cold comfort" letter dated the effective date of the Registration Statement
and the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement from the
Companys independent registered public accounting firm in customary form and
covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort"
letters as the managing underwriter reasonably requests;

(x) furnish, at the request of any seller of Registrable Securities on the
date such securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to
such registration or, if such securities are not being sold through
underwriters, on the date the Registration 

 



19  Statement with respect to such securities becomes effective, an opinion and
"negative assurance letter," dated such date, of counsel representing the
Company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters,
if any, and to the seller making such request, covering such legal matters
with respect to the registration in respect of which such opinion and letter
are being given as the underwriters, if any, and such seller may reasonably
request and are customarily included in such opinions and letter;

(xi) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission
applicable to the Registration Statement, and make available to its security
holders, as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than fifteen months
after the effective date of the Registration Statement, an earnings statement
covering a period of 12 months beginning after the effective date of the
Registration Statement, in a manner which satisfies the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated under the Securities
Act;

(xii) cause any Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement
to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same
class are then listed, _provided_ that the applicable listing requirements are
satisfied;

(xiii) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities and each
underwriter participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities
and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be
made with FINRA;

 

(xiv) cause the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities, as may be reasonably necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company to enable the seller or sellers of Registrable
Securities to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

 

(xv) provide a transfer agent and registrar for the Registrable Securities and
a CUSIP number for the Registrable Securities;

 

(xvi) take all other steps reasonably necessary to effect the registration of
the Registrable Securities contemplated hereby and reasonably cooperate with
the holders or underwriters (in the case of an underwritten offering) of such
Registrable Securities to facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities pursuant thereto;

 

(xvii) within the deadlines specified by the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder, make all required filings of all Prospectuses and
Free Writing Prospectuses with the Commission; and

(xviii) within the deadlines specified by the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder, make all required filing fee payments in respect of
any Registration Statement or Prospectus used under this Agreement (and any
offering covered thereby).

 

(b) Seller Requirements. In connection with any offering under any
Registration Statement under this Agreement, each Designated Holder
holding Registrable Securities that will be included in such Registration
Statement (i) shall promptly furnish to the

 



20  Company in writing such information with respect to such Designated Holder
and the intended method of disposition of its Registrable Securities as the
Company may reasonably request or as may be required by law or regulations
for use in connection with any related Registration Statement or Prospectus
(or amendment or supplement thereto); and (ii) shall not use any Free Writing
Prospectus without the prior written consent of the Company. If any seller of
Registrable Securities fails to provide such information required to be
included in such Registration Statement by applicable securities laws in a
timely manner after reasonable written request therefor consistent with
this Section 8(b), the Company may exclude such sellers Registrable
Securities from a registration under Sections 3, 4 or 5 hereof.

 

(c) Notice to Discontinue. Each Designated Holder agrees that, upon receipt of
any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in Section 8(a)(v)(D) hereof or, subject to Section 3(a) and 5(c)
hereof, the existence of a Valid Business Reason, such Designated Holder shall
forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until such
Designated Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 8(a)(vi) hereof
(or if no supplemental or amended prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus is
required, upon confirmation from the Company that use of the Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus is once again permitted) and, if so directed by the
Company, such Designated Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the Companys
expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Designated
Holders possession, of the Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus covering
such Registrable Securities, which is current at the time of receipt of such
notice. If the Company shall give any such notice, the Company shall extend
the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained
effective pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
period referred to in Section 8(a)(ii) hereof) by the number of days during
the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant
to Section 8(a)(v)(D) hereof to and including the date when sellers of such
Registrable Securities under such Registration Statement shall have received
the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus contemplated by and meeting the requirements of Section 8(a)(v)
hereof (or if no supplemental or amended prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus
is required, upon confirmation from the Company that use of the Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus is once again permitted).

(d) Registration Expenses. Except as provided under the last sentence of this
Section 8(d), the Company shall pay all expenses arising from or incident to
its performance of, or compliance with, this Agreement, including, without
limitation (i) all expenses, including filing fees, in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus
or final prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto, (ii) Commission,
stock exchange and FINRA registration (including any counsel retained in
connection with FINRA registration) and filing fees, (iii) transfer agents
and registrars fees and expenses, (iv) all expenses with respect to road
shows, (v) all fees and expenses incurred in complying with state securities
or "blue sky" laws (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of
counsel to any underwriter incurred in connection with "blue sky"
qualifications of the Registrable Securities as may be set forth in any
underwriting agreement), (vi) all printing, messenger and delivery expenses,
(vii) the fees, charges and expenses of counsel to the Company and of its
independent registered public accounting firm and any other accounting fees,
charges and expenses incurred by the Company (including, without limitation,

 



21  any expenses arising from any "cold comfort" letters or any special audits
incident to or required by any registration or qualification) and the
reasonable and documented legal fees, charges and expenses of the Designated
Holders Counsel up to a maximum of $50,000 and (viii) any liability insurance
or other premiums for insurance that the Company determines to obtain, if any,
in connection with any Demand Registration or piggy-back registration
thereon, Incidental Registration or S-3 Registration pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, regardless of whether such Registration Statement is declared
effective. All of the expenses described in the preceding sentence of this
Section 8(d) are referred to herein as " _Registration Expenses_." The
Designated Holders of Registrable Securities sold pursuant to a Registration
Statement shall bear the expense of any brokers commission or underwriters
discount or commission relating to the registration and sale of such
Designated Holders Registrable Securities and shall, other than as set forth
in clause (vii) above, bear the fees and expenses of their own counsel.

9\. Indemnification; Contribution.

 

(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each Designated Holder,
its partners, directors, officers, Affiliates, stockholders, members,
employees, trustees and each Person who controls (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act) such Designated Holder from and against any
and all losses, liabilities and expenses, or any action or proceeding in
respect thereof (including reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), claims and damages, joint or several, to which
they or any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act or
otherwise, including any amount paid in settlement of any litigation commenced
or threatened (each, a " _Liability_ " and collectively, " _Liabilities_ "),
in so far as such Liabilities arise out of or based upon (i) any untrue, or
allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure
Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Free Writing
Prospectus, or in any offering memorandum or other offering document relating
to the offering and sale of such Registrable Securities prepared by the
Company or at its direction, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in
any document incorporated by reference therein; (ii) the omission or alleged
omission to state in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or in any offering memorandum or other
offering document relating to the offering and sale of such
Registrable Securities prepared by the Company or at its direction, or in any
amendment or supplement thereto, or in any document incorporated by reference
therein, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading under the circumstances such statements
were made; and (iii) any violation by the Company of any federal, state or
common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to action
required of or inaction by the Company in connection with any such
registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be held
liable in any such case to the extent that any such Liability arises out of or
is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission contained in such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto in
reliance upon and in conformity with information concerning such Designated
Holder furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Designated
Holder expressly for use therein, including, without limitation, the
information furnished to the Company pursuant to Sections 9(b) hereof. The
Company shall also provide customary indemnities to any underwriters of the
Registrable Securities, their officers, directors and employees and each
Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the
indemnification of the Designated Holders of Registrable Securities.

 



22 (b) Indemnification by Designated Holders. In connection with any offering in
which a Designated Holder is participating pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 5
hereof, such Designated Holder agrees severally, and not jointly, to indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the other Designated Holders, any underwriter
retained by the Company and each Person who controls the Company, the other
Designated Holders or such underwriter (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act) to the same extent as Sections 9(a)(i) and (ii) in the
foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Designated Holders (including
indemnification of their respective partners, directors, officers, Affiliates,
stockholders, members, employees, trustees and controlling persons), but only
to the extent that Liabilities arise out of or are based upon a statement or
alleged statement or an omission or alleged omission that was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with information with respect to such Designated Holder
furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Designated Holder
expressly for use in such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus, or in any offering memorandum or other
offering document relating to the offering and sale of such Registrable
Securities prepared by the Company or at its direction, or in any amendment
or supplement thereto, or in any document incorporated by reference therein,
including, without limitation, the information furnished to the Company
pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the total
amount to be indemnified by any such Designated Holder pursuant to this
Section 9(b) shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such Designated
Holder in the offering to which such Disclosure Package, Registration
Statement, Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement
thereto relates.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to
indemnification or contribution hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees
to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any
written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which the Indemnified
Party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder (except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits
substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). If notice of
commencement of any such action is given to the Indemnifying Party as
above provided, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party
similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense,
with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party. Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid
by the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay the
same, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such action
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or (iii) the
named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and such parties have
been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or

 



23  (y) there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party. In any of such cases, the Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such
Indemnified Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local
counsel) for all Indemnified Parties and all such reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as incurred. No
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its
written consent. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of such
Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which such Indemnified Party is a party and indemnity
has been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
for claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include
any admission as to fault or culpability on the part of such Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time an Indemnified Party
shall have requested the Indemnifying Party to reimburse the Indemnified Party
for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 9, the
Indemnifying Party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any
proceeding effected without the Indemnifying Partys written consent if (i)
such settlement is entered into more than 30 Business Days after receipt by
the Indemnifying Party of the aforesaid request and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Party in accordance with such
request or contested the reasonableness of such fees and expenses prior to
the date of such settlement.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 from
the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or
insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Party in respect of any
Liabilities referred to herein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Liabilities in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted
in such Liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or
relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified
Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the Liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 9(a), 9(b) and 9(c)
hereof, any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal or other fees,
charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding; _provided_ , that the total amount to be
contributed by any Designated Holder shall be limited to the net proceeds
(after deducting the underwriters discounts and commissions) received
by such Designated Holder in the offering, less the amount of any damages
that such Designated Holder has otherwise been required to pay as a result of
such Liabilities.

 



24 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

10\. Rule 144; Restriction Removal.

 

(a) Rule 144. The Company covenants from and after the date hereof that it
shall take such action as may be required from time to time to enable each
Designated Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under
the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i)
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to
time, or (ii) any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the
Commission The Company shall, upon the request of any Designated Holder,
deliver to such Designated Holder a written statement as to whether it has
complied with such requirements; provided that, in doing so the Company may
rely upon any customary representations of such Designated Holder that the
Company may reasonably require.

 

(b) Restriction Removal. The Company shall, promptly upon the request of any
holder of Registrable Securities (and, to the extent necessary, the delivery
of such Registrable Securities to the transfer agent therefor), cause any
legend or stop-transfer instructions with respect to restrictions on transfer
under the Securities Act of such Registrable Securities to be removed or
otherwise eliminated if (i) such Registrable Securities are registered
pursuant to an effective Registration Statement, (ii) in connection with a
sale transaction, such holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel,
in a generally acceptable form, to the effect that a public sale, assignment
or transfer of the Registrable Securities may be made without registration
under the Securities Act or (iii) such holder provides the Company reasonable
assurances (by providing an opinion of counsel, in a generally acceptable
form) that the Registrable Securities have been or are being sold pursuant to,
or can then be sold by such holder without restriction or limitation under,
Rule 144. The Company shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of its
transfer agent and The Depository Trust Company associated with the issuance
of the Registrable Securities to the Designated Holder and any legend or stop-
transfer instruction removal or elimination in accordance herewith.

11\. Miscellaneous.

 

(a) Stock Splits, etc. The provisions of this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, reverse splits, combinations
recapitalizations and the like effected, after the date hereof.

(b) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company hereby represents and warrants
that it has not previously entered into any agreement granting registration
rights to any Person with respect to any securities of the Company. The
Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to its
securities that is inconsistent with or that may otherwise adversely affect
the rights granted to the Designated Holders in this Agreement or grant any
additional registration rights to any Person or with respect to any securities
that are not Registrable Securities which rights are inconsistent with or may
otherwise adversely affect the rights granted to the Designated Holders in
this Agreement.

 



25 (c) Remedies. The Designated Holders, in addition to being entitled to
exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, shall be
entitled to specific performance of their rights under this Agreement. The
Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for
any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this
Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 

(d) Amendments and Waivers. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented,
and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be
given unless consented to in writing by the Company and the Majority
Designated Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that no amendment,
modification, supplement, waiver or consent to depart from the provisions
hereof shall be effective if such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver
or consent to depart from the provisions hereof materially and adversely
affects the substantive rights or obligations of one Designated Holder, or
subset of Designated Holders, without a similar and proportionate effect on
the substantive rights or obligations of all Designated Holders, unless each
such disproportionately affected Designated Holder or group thereof consents
in writing thereto.

(e) Notices. All notices, demands and other communications provided for or

2\. General; Securities Subject to this Agreement.

 

(a) Grant of Rights. The Company hereby grants registration rights to the
Designated Holders upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Registrable Securities. For the purposes of this Agreement, any
Registrable Securities held by any Designated Holder will cease to be
Registrable Securities, when (i) a Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities has been declared effective under the Securities Act by
the Commission and such Registrable Securities have been disposed of pursuant
to such effective Registration Statement, (ii) such Registrable Securities
are sold pursuant to Rule 144, (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (which may be waived by the Company in its sole
discretion), the entire amount of the Registrable Securities held by any
Designated Holder may be sold in a single sale, without any limitation as to
volume or manner of sale, and without any public information or other
requirement, pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, (iv)
such Designated Holder beneficially owns less than 1% of the outstanding Non-
Convertible Preferred Shares, (v) the Registrable Securities have ceased to be
outstanding or (vi) the Registrable Securities have been sold in a private
transaction in which the transferors rights under this Agreement are not
assigned to the transferee of the securities.

 

(c) Holders of Registrable Securities. A Person is deemed to be a holder of
Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns of record Registrable
Securities. If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or
elections from two or more Persons with respect to the same Registrable
Securities, the Company may act upon the basis of the instructions, notice
or election received from the registered owner of such Registrable
Securities. Registrable Securities issuable upon conversion of Convertible
Preferred Shares shall be deemed outstanding for the purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(d) Transfer of Registration Rights.

 

(i) Each Designated Holder may transfer or pledge Registrable Securities, or
the securities convertible into such Registrable Securities, with the
associated registration rights under this Agreement (including transfers
occurring by operation of law or by reason of intestacy) to a Permitted
Assignee or a pledgee (" _Pledgee_ ") only if (1) such Permitted Assignee
or Pledgee agrees in writing to be bound as a Designated Holder by the
provisions of this Agreement, such agreement being substantially in the form
of _Annex A_ hereto, and (2) (A) immediately following such transfer or
pledge, such Registrable Securities (including Registrable Securities
issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Shares) continue to
constitute Registrable Securities as held by such Permitted Assignee or
Pledgee or (B) such 

 



6  Permitted Assignee, together with its Affiliates, beneficially owns
Registrable Securities representing more than 1% of the Non-Convertible
Preferred Shares as of the date of such transfer. Upon any transfer or pledge
of Registrable Securities or the securities convertible into such Registrable
Securities other than as set forth in this Section 2(d), such securities shall
no longer constitute Registrable Securities (or securities convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable for Registrable Securities, as applicable).

(ii) Subject to Section 2(b) hereof, if a Designated Holder (including,
without limitation, a Crestview Holder) assigns its rights under this
Agreement in connection with the transfer of less than all of its Registrable
Securities, the Designated Holder shall retain its rights under
this Agreement with respect to its remaining Registrable Securities. If a
Designated Holder (including, without limitation, a Crestview Holder) assigns
its rights under this Agreement in connection with the transfer of all of its
Registrable Securities, such Designated Holder shall have no further rights
or obligations under this Agreement, except under Section 9 hereof in respect
of offerings in which it participated or registrations in which Registrable
Securities held by such Designated Holder were included.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary,
solely for purposes of the priorities for inclusion of Registrable Securities
in an underwritten offering as set forth in Sections 3(e), 4(a) and 5(b), as
such priorities are applicable to a Permitted Assignee, only the Registrable
Securities transferred to such Permitted Assignee shall be treated as
Registrable Securities held by a Designated Holder.

3\. Demand Registration.

 

(a) Request for Demand Registration. To the extent permitted by applicable law
and regulations, and subject to Section 6 hereof on up to a maximum of two
occasions, at any time on or after the first anniversary of the date hereof,
any Crestview Holder (in each case, a " _Demand Initiating Holder_ ") may make
a written request to the Company to register, and the Company shall register,
under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to a Registration Statement on
Form S-4 or S-8), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (a " _Demand
Registration_ "), the number of Registrable Securities stated in such request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect (i)
a Demand Registration if the Demand Initiating Holders, together with the
Designated Holders (other than the Demand Initiating Holders) that have
requested to register securities in such registration statement pursuant to
Section 3(b), propose to sell Registrable Securities having aggregate
Face Value (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) of less than
$30,000,000, and (ii) any Demand Registration within the Specified Period (or
such shorter period as the Company may determine in its sole discretion) after
the effective date of any other Registration Statement of the Company (other
than a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that a Demand Registration shall be deemed not to have been effected if (i)
after it has become effective, such registration statement is interfered with
by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission
or other governmental authority for any reason other than a misrepresentation
or an omission by a Designated Holder affiliated with the Demand Initiating
Holder, (ii) the registration statement does not remain effective for the
period specified in Section 3(c), or (iii) in the event of an underwritten
offering, if the conditions to closing specified in the purchase agreement or
underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such

 



7  registration are not satisfied or waived other than by reason of some
wrongful act or omission by a Designated Holder affiliated with the Demand
Initiating Holder. In addition, if (1) the Board of Directors, in its good
faith judgment, determines that any registration of Registrable Securities
should not be made or continued because it would materially impede, delay or
interfere with any proposed financing, offer and sale of securities,
acquisition, merger, tender offer, business combination, corporate
reorganization, material operational development or other significant
transaction involving the Company or because such registration would require
the Company to disclose material nonpublic information that would not
otherwise be required to be disclosed under applicable law, and (2) the
Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving the confidentiality of
such proposed transaction or information (a " _Valid Business Reason_ "), (x)
the Company may postpone filing a Registration Statement (but not the
preparation of the Registration Statement) relating to a Demand Registration
until such Valid Business Reason no longer exists or, if later, the
occurrence of the Valid Business Reason (but in no event may the duration of
such postponement last for more than 45 days after the date when the Demand
Registration was requested), and (y) in case a Registration Statement
has been filed relating to a Demand Registration, the Company may postpone
amending or supplementing such Registration Statement (in which case, if the
Valid Business Reason no longer exists or if more than 45 days have passed
since such postponement, the Demand Initiating Holder may request a new
Demand Registration (which request shall not be counted as an additional
Demand Registration for purposes of this Section 3(a)) or request the prompt
amendment or supplement of such Registration Statement). The Company shall
give written notice to the Demand Initiating Holder of each of its
determination to postpone filing, amending or supplementing a Registration
Statement, and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for
such postponement no longer exists or has occurred, as applicable, in each
case, promptly after the occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company may not postpone a filing, amendment or
supplement under this Section 3(a) due to a Valid Business Reason for more
than 90 days in any 12-month period. Each request for a Demand Registration by
the Demand Initiating Holder shall state the type and amount of the
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the intended method of
disposition thereof, which may include a distribution of Registrable
Securities to, and resale of such Registrable Securities by, the equity
holders of any Crestview Holder or its equity holders (a "
_Partner Distribution_ "). The Demand Registration may be a shelf
registration pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, in
which case the provisions of Section 5(f) shall apply.

 

(b) Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Rights with Respect to a Demand Registration.
Subject to Section 4(b), any Designated Holder that has not requested a
registration under Section 3(a) hereof may, pursuant to this Section 3(b),
offer its Registrable Securities under any Demand Registration. The Company
shall (i) subject to clause (ii) below, as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than ten Business Days after the receipt of a request for a Demand
Registration from a Demand Initiating Holder give written notice thereof to
all of the Designated Holders (other than such Demand Initiating Holder),
which notice shall specify the type and number of Registrable Securities
subject to the request for Demand Registration and the intended method of
disposition of such Registrable Securities, (ii) in the case of
a postponement due to a Valid Business Reason pursuant to Section 3(a),
provide the notice specified in clause (i) above no later than 10 Business
Days prior to the anticipated expiration of the postponement period, and (iii)
subject to Section 3(e) hereof, include in the Registration Statement filed
pursuant to the Demand Registration all of the Registrable Securities held by
such Designated

 



8  Holders from whom the Company has received a written request for inclusion
therein within five Business Days of the date on which the Company has given
the written notice referred to in clause (i) above. Each such request by such
Designated Holder shall specify the type and number of Registrable Securities
proposed to be registered. The failure of any Designated Holder to respond
within the five Business Day period referred to in clause (ii) above shall be
deemed to be a waiver of such Designated Holders rights under this Section
3(b) with respect to such Demand Registration. Any Designated Holder may waive
its rights under this Section 3(b) by giving written notice to the Company.

(c) Effective Demand Registration. Subject to Section 3(a), the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account, among other
things, accounting and regulatory matters) to file a Registration Statement
relating to the Demand Registration and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be filed within 45 days of
receipt of a Demand Registration and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
request that the Registration Statement become effective as soon as
practicable but in no event later than 90 days after it files
the Registration Statement and to remain continuously effective for the
lesser of (i) the period during which all Registrable Securities registered in
the Demand Registration are sold or (ii) 120 days (or in the case of a shelf
registration, three years from the effective date of the applicable shelf
registration; _provided that_ , if during such three year period the Company
shall no longer be eligible to use a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or
any successor form), the Company shall maintain a shelf registration for a
period of two years from the effective date of the applicable registration
statement.

(d) Expenses. Except as provided in Section 3(g) or 8(d) hereof, the Company
shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with a Demand Registration,
including all Registration Expenses relating to the registration of
Registrable Securities included in any such Demand Registration pursuant to
Section 3(b), whether or not such Demand Registration becomes effective.

(e) Underwriting Procedures. If the applicable Demand Initiating Holder so
elects, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
offering made pursuant to such Demand Registration pursuant to this Section 3
to be in the form of a firm commitment underwritten public offering and the
managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such offering shall be the
Approved Underwriter selected in accordance with Section 3(f) hereof. In
connection with any Demand Registration under this Section 3 involving an
underwritten offering, none of the Registrable Securities held by a Designated
Holder making a request for inclusion of such Registrable Securities pursuant
to Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof shall be included in such underwritten
offering unless such Designated Holder accepts the terms of the offering as
agreed upon by the Company, the Demand Initiating Holder and the Approved
Underwriter (including, without limitation, offering price, underwriting
commissions or discounts and lockup agreement terms, subject to Section 7(a)),
and then only in such quantity as set forth below. If the Approved Underwriter
advises the Company in good faith that the aggregate amount of
such Registrable Securities requested to be included in such offering is
sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the distribution or
sales price of the Registrable Securities in such offering, then the Company
shall include in such Demand Registration, to the extent of the amount that
the Approved Underwriter believes may be sold

 



9  without causing such material adverse effect, _first_ , such number of
Registrable Securities of the Designated Holders that are participating in
such offering pursuant to Section 3(a) or 3(b) hereof, which Registrable
Securities shall be allocated pro rata among the Designated Holders
participating in the offering, based on the aggregate number of Registrable
Securities held by each such Designated Holder, and _second_ , securities
offered by the Company for its own account.

(f) Selection of Underwriters. If any Demand Registration, S-3 Registration
or Shelf Take-Down, as the case may be, of Registrable Securities is in the
form of an underwritten public offering, the Demand Initiating Holder or S-3
Initiating Holder, as applicable, for such registration or Shelf Take-Down
shall select and obtain one or more investment banking firms of national or
regional reputation to act as the managing underwriter or underwriters of the
offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that such firm or firms shall, in any case,
also be approved by the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. An investment banking firm or firms selected
pursuant to this Section 3(f) shall be referred to as the " _Approved
Underwriter_ " herein.

 

(g) Withdrawal. The Demand Initiating Holder shall be entitled to withdraw or
revoke its request for a Demand Registration without the prior written
consent of the Company if (i) such withdrawal or revocation is as a result of
facts or circumstances arising after the date on which a request for a Demand
Registration was made and the Demand Initiating Holder reasonably
determines that participation in such registration would have a material
adverse effect on the Demand Initiating Holder, (ii) the Closing Price is more
than fifteen percent lower than the Closing Price on the date the Demand
Initiating Holder requested such Demand Registration or (iii) such Demand
Initiating Holder agrees to pay all fees and expenses incurred by the Company
in connection with such withdrawn registration (each, a " _Permitted
Withdrawal_ "). Any Permitted Withdrawal shall constitute and effect an
automatic withdrawal by any other Designated Holder participating in such
Demand Registration pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof.

 

(h) Partner Distributions. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Company shall, at the request of any Crestview Holders seeking
to effect a Partner Distribution, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
file any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendments and shall
otherwise take action reasonably necessary to include such language, if such
language was not included in the initial Registration Statement, or revise
such language if deemed necessary by such Crestview Holder, to effect such
Partner Distribution (including adding one or more selling equityholders to
the registration statement through a prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment, as reasonably necessary or required).

4\. Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Registration.

(a) Request for Incidental or "Piggy-Back" Registration. If the Company
proposes to file a Registration Statement, that will become effective at any
time on or after the first anniversary of the date hereof, with respect to an
offering by the Company of Non-Convertible Preferred Shares or any class of
security convertible into Non-Convertible Preferred Shares for its own
account (other than a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8) or for the
account of any shareholder of the Company (other than Designated Holders
pursuant to

 



10  Sections 3 and 5 hereof), then the Company shall give written notice (an "
_Incidental Registration Notice_ ") of such proposed filing to each of the
Designated Holders at least five Business Days before the anticipated filing
date, which notice shall describe the proposed registration and distribution
and, subject to Section 4(b), offer such Designated Holders the opportunity to
register the number of Registrable Securities that each such Designated
Holder may request (an " _Incidental Registration_ "). Any such request by a
Designated Holder must be made in writing and received by the Company within
five Business Days of the date on which the Company has given the Incidental
Registration Notice. The failure of any Designated Holder to respond to an
Incidental Registration Notice within five Business Days shall be deemed a
waiver of such Designated Holders rights under this Section 4(a) with
respect to such Incidental Registration. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the managing underwriter or
underwriters in the case of a proposed underwritten offering (the "
_Company Underwriter_ ") to permit each Designated Holder who has requested
in writing to participate in the Incidental Registration pursuant to this
Section 4(a) to include the number of such Designated Holders Registrable
Securities indicated by such Designated Holder in such offering on the same
terms and conditions as the Non-Convertible Preferred Shares or class of
security convertible into Non-Convertible Preferred Shares, as applicable, for
the account of the Company or the account of such other equityholder, as the
case may be, included therein. Any withdrawal of the Registration Statement by
the Company for any reason shall constitute and effect an automatic withdrawal
of any Incidental Registration related thereto. In connection with any
Incidental Registration under this Section 4(a) involving an underwritten
offering, the Company shall not be required to include any Registrable
Securities held by a Designated Holder in such underwritten offering unless
such Designated Holder accepts the terms of the underwritten offering as
agreed upon between the Company, such other equityholders, if any, and the
Company Underwriter (including, without limitation, offering price,
underwriting commissions or discounts and lockup agreement terms, subject to
Section 7(a)), and then only in such quantity as set forth below. If the
Company Underwriter advises the Company in good faith that the aggregate
amount of the securities requested to be included in such offering is
sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the distribution or
sales price of the securities in such offering, then the Company shall include
in such Incidental Registration, to the extent of the amount that the Company
Underwriter believes may be sold without causing such material adverse effect:
(i) in the case of a Company initiated Incidental Registration, _first_ (x)
all of the securities to be offered for the account of the Company, and
_second_ (y) any Registrable Securities that are participating in such
offering pursuant to this Section 4(a), which Registrable Securities shall be
allocated pro rata among the Designated Holders participating in
the offering, based on the aggregate number of Registrable Securities held by
each such Designated Holder, except to the extent any such holders have agreed
under existing agreements to which the Company is a signatory to grant
priority with regard to participation in such offering to any other holders
of securities of the Company, and (ii) in the case of an Incidental
Registration initiated by equityholders of the Company (including any
Designated Holder), _first_ , (A) any Registrable Securities requested by
holders thereof, pro rata among the Designated Holders and such other holders
based on the number of securities held by each such holder, and _second_ , (B)
all of the securities to be offered for the account of the Company.

(b) Expenses. Except as provided in Section 8(d) hereof, the Company shall
bear all Registration Expenses in connection with any Incidental Registration
pursuant to this Section 4, whether or not such Incidental Registration
becomes effective.

 



11 5\. Form S-3 Registration.

 

(a) Request for a Form S-3 Registration. At any time, on or after the first
anniversary of the date hereof, at which the Company is eligible for use of
Form S-3 under the Securities Act in connection with a secondary public
offering of Registrable Securities, in the event that the Company
shall receive from any Crestview Holder (the " _S-3 Initiating Holder_ "),
shall be entitled under this Section 5to make on behalf of all Crestview
Holders and Designated Holders, subject to Section 6 hereof, on up to a
maximum of four occasions, a written request that the Company register under
the Securities Act on Form S-3 (or any successor form) (an " _S-3
 Registration_") the sale of all or a portion of the Registrable Securities
owned by such S-3 Initiating Holder (which S-3 Registration may be a shelf
registration pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, in
which case the provisions of Section 5(f) shall apply), the Company shall give
written notice of such request to all of the other Designated Holders (other
than such S-3 Initiating Holder) as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than five Business Days before the anticipated filing date of such Form
S-3, which notice shall describe the proposed registration, the intended
method of disposition of such Registrable Securities and any other
information that at the time would be appropriate to include in such notice,
and offer such other Designated Holders the opportunity to register the number
of Registrable Securities as each such Designated Holder may request in
writing to the Company, given within five Business Days of the date on which
the Company has given the written notice of such registration; _provided that_
, an S-3 Registration shall be deemed not to have been effected if (i) after
it has become effective, such registration statement is interfered with by any
stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission or
other governmental authority for any reason other than a misrepresentation or
an omission by a Designated Holder affiliated with the S-3 Initiating Holder,
(ii) the registration statement does not remain effective for the period
specified in Section 8(a)(ii), or (iii) in the event of an underwritten
offering, if the conditions to closing specified in the purchase agreement or
underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such registration are
not satisfied or waived other than by reason of some wrongful act or omission
by a Designated Holder affiliated with the S-3 Initiating Holder. Each
request for an S-3 Registration by an S-3 Initiating Holder shall state the
type and number of the Registrable Securities proposed to be registered and
the intended method of disposition thereof. With respect to each S-3
Registration, the Company shall, subject to Section 5(b) hereof, (A) include
in such offering the Registrable Securities of the S-3 Initiating Holder and
the Designated Holders who have requested in writing to participate in such
registration on the same terms and conditions as the Registrable Securities of
the S-3 Initiating Holder included therein (collectively, the " _S-3
 Participating Holders_") and (B) file a Registration Statement on Form S-3
(or any successor form) relating to the S-3 Registration and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be
filed within 45 days of receipt of an S-3 Registration request and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to request that the Registration Statement
become effective as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after it
files the Registration Statement on Form S-3; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be obligated to effect an S-3 Registration if the S-3
Initiating Holders, together with the Designated Holders (other than the S-3
Initiating Holders) that have requested to register securities in such
registration statement pursuant to this Section 5(a), propose to sell
Registrable Securities having aggregate Face Value (as such term is defined in
the Merger Agreement) of less than $20,000,000. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, immediately upon determination of the price at which such
Registrable Securities are to be sold in an S-3 Registration that is a firm
commitment

 



12  underwritten public offering, if such price is below the price which the S-3
Initiating Holder finds acceptable, the S-3 Initiating Holder for the
S-3 Registration shall then have the right, by written notice to the Company,
to withdraw its Registrable Securities from being included in such offering;
_provided_ , that such a withdrawal by the S-3 Initiating Holder shall
constitute and effect an automatic withdrawal by all other S-3 Participating
Holders, but shall represent the use of an underwritten public offering under
Section 6\. If the S-3 Initiating Holder requests, and if the Company is a
Well-Known Seasoned Issuer, the Company shall cause such S-3 Registration to
be made pursuant to an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement and, if
requested, may omit the names of the S-3 Participating Holders and the amount
of the Registrable Securities to be offered thereunder. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to be and remain eligible to use Form S-3
for registration of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 at all
times on and after the date of this Agreement until the date upon which there
ceases to be outstanding any Registrable Securities.

 

(b) Form S-3 Underwriting Procedures. If the S-3 Initiating Holder so elects,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such S-3
Registration pursuant to this Section 5 to be in the form of a firm commitment
underwritten public offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters
selected for such offering shall be the Approved Underwriter selected in
accordance with Section 3(f) hereof. In connection with any S-3 Registration
under this Section 5 involving an underwritten public offering, none of the
Registrable Securities held by a Designated Holder making a request for
inclusion of such Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof shall
be included in such underwritten offering unless such Designated Holder
accepts the terms of the offering as agreed upon by the Company, the S-3
Initiating Holder and the Approved Underwriter (including, without limitation,
offering price, underwriting commissions and discounts and lockup agreement
terms, subject to Section 8(a)) and then only in such quantity as set forth
below.

If the Approved Underwriter advises the Company in good faith that the
aggregate amount of such Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such offering is sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the
distribution or sales price of the Registrable Securities in such offering,
then the Company shall include in such offering, to the extent of the amount
that the Approved Underwriter believes may be sold without causing such
material adverse effect, _first_ , such number of Registrable Securities of
the Designated Holders participating in the offering under Section 5(a)
hereof, which Registrable Securities shall be allocated pro rata among such
Designated Holders participating in the offering, based on the number of
Registrable Securities held by each such Designated Holder, and _second_ ,
securities offered by the Company for its own account.

(c) Limitations on Form S-3 Registrations. If the Board of Directors, in its
good faith judgment, determines that a Valid Business Reason exists, (x) the
Company may postpone filing a Registration Statement relating to an S-3
Registration (but not the preparation of the Registration Statement) until
such Valid Business Reason no longer exists or, if later, the occurrence of
the Valid Business Reason (but in no event may the duration of such
postponement last for more than 45 days after the date when the S-3
Registration was requested), and (y) in case a Registration Statement has been
filed relating to an S-3 Registration, the Company may postpone amending
or supplementing such Registration Statement (in which case, if the Valid
Business Reason no longer exists or if more than 45 days have passed since
such

 



13  postponement, the S-3 Initiating Holder may request the prompt amendment or
supplement of such Registration Statement or a new S-3 Registration).
The Company shall give written notice to the S-3 Initiating Holder of each of
its determination to postpone or delay amending or supplementing a
Registration Statement and of the fact that a Valid Business Reason for such
postponement or delay no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the
occurrence thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Company may not postpone a filing or delay amending or supplementing a
filing under this Section 5(c) due to a Valid Business Reason for more than
90 days in any 12-month period. In addition, the Company shall not be required
to effect any registration at the request of any Designated Holder pursuant to
Section 5(a) hereof (i) within the Specified Period after the effective date
of any other Registration Statement of the Company relating to any
underwritten public offering in which any of such Designated Holders
Registrable Securities were included (other than a Registration Statement on
Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form thereto) or after an Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down, or (ii) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the S-3
Initiating Holder.

(d) Expenses. Except as provided in Section 8(d) hereof, the Company shall
bear all Registration Expenses in connection with any S-3 Registration
pursuant to this Section 5, whether or not such S-3 Registration becomes
effective.

 

(e) Automatic Shelf Registration Statement. After the Registration Statement
with respect to an S-3 Registration that is an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement becomes effective, upon written request by the S-3 Initiating Holder
for the S-3 Registration, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after
receiving such request, (i) file with the Commission a prospectus supplement
naming the S-3 Participating Holders as selling shareholders and the amount of
Registrable Securities to be offered and include, to the extent not included
or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any other
information omitted from the Prospectus used in connection with such
Registration Statement as permitted by Rule 430B promulgated under the
Securities Act (including the plan of distribution and the names of any
underwriters, placement agents or brokers) and (ii) pay any necessary filing
fees to the Commission within the time period required.

 

(f) Shelf Registration Statement. (i) The S-3 Initiating Holder for an S-3
Registration that provides for offers and sales of Registrable Securities on
a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act (a "
_Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement_") may initiate an offering or sale of
all or part of such Registrable Securities (a " _Shelf Take-Down_ "). The
Company shall cause a Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement covering all of
the Registrable Securities to be effective on or before the first anniversary
of the date hereof, and each Crestview Holder shall be deemed to be an S-3
Initiating Holder for such S-3 Registration. The provisions of this Section
5(f) shall apply to any Shelf Take-Down.

 

(ii) If an S-3 Initiating Holder so elects in a written request delivered to
the Company (an " _Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice_ "), a Shelf Take-Down
may be in the form of an underwritten public offering (an " _Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down_ ") and, subject to the limitations set forth in the proviso
to Section 5(a), the Company shall file and effect an amendment or supplement
to its Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement for such purpose as soon as
practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated
to effect a Underwritten Shelf Take-Down if the S-3 Initiating Holders,
together with the

 



14  Designated Holders (other than the S-3 Initiating Holders) that have
requested inclusion in such Shelf Take-Down pursuant to this Section 5(f),
propose to sell Registrable Securities having aggregate Face Value (as such
term is defined in the Merger Agreement) of less than $20,000,000. The S-3
Initiating Holder shall indicate in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice
whether it intends for such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to involve a
customary "road show" (including an "electronic road show") by the
underwriters (a " _Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ "). Upon receipt of
an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice indicating that such Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down will be a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, the Company
shall promptly (but in any event no later than ten Business Days prior to the
expected date of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down) give written
notice of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down to all other S-3
Participating Holders and shall permit the participation of all such S-3
Participating Holders that request inclusion in such Marketed Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down who respond in writing within ten Business Days after the
receipt of such notice of their election to participate. The provisions of
Section 5(b) (other than the first sentence thereof) shall apply with respect
to the right of the S-3 Initiating Holder and any other S-3 Participating
Holder to participate in any Underwritten Shelf Take-Down.

 

(iii) If the S-3 Initiating Holder desires to effect a Shelf Take-Down that
does not constitute a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (a " _Non-
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down_ "), the S-3 Initiating Holder shall so
indicate in a written request delivered to the Company no later than two
Business Days prior to the expected date of such Non-Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, which request shall include (i) the total
number of Registrable Securities expected to be offered and sold in such Non-
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, (ii) the expected plan of distribution
of such Non-Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down and (iii) the action or
actions required (including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down (including the delivery of one or more
stock certificates representing shares of Registrable Securities to be sold
in such Non-Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down), and, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 5(a), the Company shall file and effect an
amendment or supplement to its Form S-3 Shelf Registration Statement for such
purpose as soon as practicable.

6\. Maximum Number of Underwritten Registrations.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall the
aggregate number of underwritten public offerings under Sections 3 and 5 be
greater than four.

7\. Holdback Agreements.

 

(a) Restrictions on Public Sale by Designated Holders.

 

(i) To the extent requested by the Approved Underwriter or the Company
Underwriter, as the case may be, in the case of an underwritten
public offering, such Designated Holder agrees (x) not to effect any public
sale or distribution of any Registrable Securities or of any securities
convertible into or exercisable for such Registrable Securities, including a
sale pursuant to Rule 144 (or any successor rule or regulation) promulgated
under the Securities Act, or offer to sell, contract to sell (including,
without limitation, any short sale), grant any option to purchase or enter
into any hedging or similar transaction with the same

 



15  economic effect as a sale of, any Registrable Securities and (y) except as
otherwise consented to by the Company, not to make any request for a Demand
Registration or S-3 Registration under this Agreement, in each case, during
the Specified Period, except in each case as part of such underwritten public
offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any Designated Holder that does
not have Registrable Securities included in an underwritten offering shall not
be subject to the foregoing obligations under this Section 7(a)(i) unless all
of the executive officers and directors of the Company and all of the
other Designated Holders are subject to the same obligations, and (B) any
discretionary waiver or termination of any Lock-up Agreement applicable to any
of the Companys executive officers or directors or Designated Holders shall
apply to the Crestview Holders and any Permitted Assignees thereof to which
his rights hereunder are assigned pursuant to Section 2(d) hereof, pro rata
based upon the number of shares subject to such obligations. To the extent
that any Designated Holder does not hold any Registrable Securities, then the
provisions of this Section 7(a)(i) shall not apply to such Designated Holder.

 

(ii) To the extent that any Designated Holder enters into a Lock-Up Agreement
in connection with an underwritten offering, such Lock-Up Agreement shall
supersede the terms of Section 7(a)(i) with respect to such Designated Holder.

(iii) The Designated Holders hereby agree that they shall act in good faith
with respect to the restrictions set forth in this Section 7(a) and shall take
no action or omit to take any action with the intention of circumventing or
evading the restrictions applicable to them under this 7(a).

8\. Registration Procedures.

 

(a) Obligations of the Company. Whenever registration of Registrable
Securities has been requested or required pursuant to Section 3, Section 4 or
Section 5 hereof, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the registration and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance
with the intended method of distribution thereof as quickly as practicable,
and in connection with any such request, the Company shall:

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account, among other
things, accounting and regulatory matters) to, as expeditiously as
practicable, prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement on
any form for which the Company then qualifies or which counsel for
the Company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the
sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of
distribution thereof, and cause such Registration Statement to become
effective; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (x) before filing a Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (including,
without limitation, any documents incorporated by reference therein), or
before using any Free Writing Prospectus, the Company shall provide one firm
of legal counsel selected by the Designated Holders holding a majority of the
Registrable Securities being registered in such registration (" _Designated
Holders  Counsel_"), any managing underwriter or broker/dealer participating
in any disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration
Statement and any attorney retained by any such managing underwriter or
broker/dealer (each, an " _Inspector_ " and collectively, the " _Inspectors_
") with an opportunity to review and comment on such Registration Statement
and each Prospectus

 



16  included therein (and each amendment or supplement thereto) and each Free
Writing Prospectus to be filed with the Commission, subject to such documents
being under the Companys control, and (y) the Company shall notify the
Designated Holders Counsel and each seller of Registrable Securities pursuant
to such Registration Statement of any stop order issued or threatened by the
Commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of
such stop order or to remove it if entered; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall not include any information relating to a Designated Holder in
any such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto (including such documents that, upon filing, would be incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) to which such Designated
Holder shall object, in writing, on a timely basis, unless, in the opinion of
the Company, the inclusion of such information is necessary to comply with
applicable law or regulation;

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as expeditiously as
practicable, prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective for the lesser of (x) 120 days (or, in the case of a shelf
registration statement, three years from the effective date of the applicable
Registration Statement); _provided that_ , if during such three year period
the Company shall no longer be eligible to use a Registration Statement on
Form S-3 (or any successor form), the Company shall maintain a shelf
registration for a period of two years from the effective date of the
applicable registration statement, and (y) such shorter period that will
terminate when all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement have been sold pursuant to such Registration Statement or otherwise
no longer constitute Registrable Securities; and comply with the provisions
of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities
covered by such Registration Statement during such period in accordance with
the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in
such Registration Statement;

(iii) as expeditiously as practicable, furnish to each seller of Registrable
Securities such number of copies of such Registration Statement, each
amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits
thereto), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including
each preliminary Prospectus), any Prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
Securities Act and any Free Writing Prospectus as each such seller may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities owned by such seller;

 

(iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as expeditiously as
practicable, register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any seller of
Registrable Securities may reasonably request, and continue such registration
or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction for as long as permissible
pursuant to the laws of such jurisdiction, or for as long as any such seller
requests or until all of such Registrable Securities are sold, whichever is
shortest, and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to enable any such seller to consummate the
disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by such
seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (x)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 8(a)(iv), (y) subject
itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z) consent to general service
of process in any such jurisdiction; 

 



17 (v) as expeditiously as practicable, notify each seller of Registrable
Securities: (A) when a Prospectus, any Prospectus supplement, any Free
Writing Prospectus, a Registration Statement or a post-effective amendment to
a Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission, and, with respect
to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same
has become effective; (B) of any request by the Commission or any other
federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a
Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or for
additional information; (C) of the receipt by the Company of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from
qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for such
purpose; and (D) of the existence of any fact or happening of any event which
makes any statement of a material fact in such Registration Statement, related
Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed
to be incorporated therein by reference untrue or which would require the
making of any changes in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free
Writing Prospectus in order that, in the case of the Registration Statement,
it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of such Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading;

(vi) use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as expeditiously as
practicable, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section
8(a)(v)(D) hereof or, subject to Sections 3(a) and 5(c) hereof, the existence
of a Valid Business Reason, prepare a supplement or amendment to such
Registration Statement, related Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus and
furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities a reasonable number of copies
of such supplement to, or amendment of, such Registration Statement,
Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus as may be necessary so that, after
delivery to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, in the case of the
Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case
of such Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(vii) enter into and perform customary agreements (including an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Approved Underwriter or Company
Underwriter, if any, selected as provided in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5
hereof, as the case may be) and take such other commercially reasonable
actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities, including making such
representations and warranties to the holders of such Registrable Securities
and the underwriters participating in the offering, with respect to the
business of the Company, the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents,
if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, in
each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers in
underwritten offerings, and shall provide all reasonable cooperation,
including causing its appropriate officers to attend and participate in "road
shows" and other information meetings organized by the Approved Underwriter
or Company Underwriter, if and as applicable, and causing counsel to the
Company to deliver customary legal opinions in connection with any such
underwriting agreements;

 



18 (viii) make available at reasonable times for inspection by any Inspector all
financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of
the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Records_ ") as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Companys and its subsidiaries officers,
directors and employees, and the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm, to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
Inspector in connection with such Registration Statement. Records that the
Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies
the Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by the Inspectors (and
the Inspectors shall confirm their agreement in writing in advance to the
Company if the Company shall so request) unless (x) the disclosure of such
Records is necessary, in the Companys judgment, to avoid or correct a
misstatement or omission in the Registration Statement, (y) the release of
such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of
competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom or (z) the
information in such Records was known to the Inspectors on a non-confidential
basis prior to its disclosure by the Company or has been made generally
available to the public. Each Inspector agrees that it shall, upon learning
that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, promptly give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at
the Companys expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure
of the Records deemed confidential. In the event that the Company is
unsuccessful in preventing the disclosure of such Records, such Inspector
agrees that it shall furnish only such portion of those Records that it is
advised by counsel is legally required and shall exercise all reasonable
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to those Records;

(ix) if such sale is pursuant to an underwritten public offering, obtain a
"cold comfort" letter dated the effective date of the Registration Statement
and the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement from the
Companys independent registered public accounting firm in customary form and
covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort"
letters as the managing underwriter reasonably requests;

(x) furnish, at the request of any seller of Registrable Securities on the
date such securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to
such registration or, if such securities are not being sold through
underwriters, on the date the Registration Statement with respect to such
securities becomes effective, an opinion and "negative assurance letter,"
dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
registration, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the seller making
such request, covering such legal matters with respect to the registration in
respect of which such opinion and letter are being given as the underwriters,
if any, and such seller may reasonably request and are customarily included
in such opinions and letter;

(xi) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission
applicable to the Registration Statement, and make available to its security
holders, as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than fifteen months
after the effective date of the Registration Statement, an earnings statement
covering a period of 12 months beginning after the effective date of the
Registration Statement, in a manner which satisfies the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated under the Securities Act;

 



19 (xii) cause any Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement
to be listed on each securities exchange on which securities of the same
class are then listed, _provided_ that the applicable listing requirements are
satisfied;

 

(xiii) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities and each
underwriter participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities
and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be
made with FINRA;

(xiv) cause the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities, as may be reasonably necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company to enable the seller or sellers of Registrable
Securities to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(xv) provide a transfer agent and registrar for the Registrable Securities
and a CUSIP number for the Registrable Securities;

(xvi) take all other steps reasonably necessary to effect the registration of
the Registrable Securities contemplated hereby and reasonably cooperate with
the holders or underwriters (in the case of an underwritten offering) of such
Registrable Securities to facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities pursuant thereto;

(xvii) within the deadlines specified by the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder, make all required filings of all Prospectuses and
Free Writing Prospectuses with the Commission; and

(xviii) within the deadlines specified by the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder, make all required filing fee payments in respect of
any Registration Statement or Prospectus used under this Agreement (and any
offering covered thereby).

 

(b) Seller Requirements. In connection with any offering under any
Registration Statement under this Agreement, each Designated Holder
holding Registrable Securities that will be included in such Registration
Statement (i) shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing such
information with respect to such Designated Holder and the intended method of
disposition of its Registrable Securities as the Company may reasonably
request or as may be required by law or regulations for use in connection with
any related Registration Statement or Prospectus (or amendment or supplement
thereto); and (ii) shall not use any Free Writing Prospectus without the
prior written consent of the Company. If any seller of Registrable Securities
fails to provide such information required to be included in such Registration
Statement by applicable securities laws in a timely manner after reasonable
written request therefor consistent with this Section 8(b), the Company may
exclude such sellers Registrable Securities from a registration under
Sections 3, 4 or 5 hereof.

 



20 (c) Notice to Discontinue. Each Designated Holder agrees that, upon receipt of
any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in Section 8(a)(v)(D) hereof or, subject to Section 3(a) and 5(c)
hereof, the existence of a Valid Business Reason, such Designated Holder shall
forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until such
Designated Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 8(a)(vi) hereof
(or if no supplemental or amended prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus is
required, upon confirmation from the Company that use of the Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus is once again permitted) and, if so directed by the
Company, such Designated Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the Companys
expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Designated
Holders possession, of the Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus covering
such Registrable Securities, which is current at the time of receipt of such
notice. If the Company shall give any such notice, the Company shall extend
the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained
effective pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
period referred to in Section 8(a)(ii) hereof) by the number of days during
the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant
to Section 8(a)(v)(D) hereof to and including the date when sellers of such
Registrable Securities under such Registration Statement shall have received
the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus contemplated by and meeting the requirements of Section 8(a)(v)
hereof (or if no supplemental or amended prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus
is required, upon confirmation from the Company that use of the Prospectus or
Free Writing Prospectus is once again permitted).

(d) Registration Expenses. Except as provided under the last sentence of this
Section 8(d), the Company shall pay all expenses arising from or incident to
its performance of, or compliance with, this Agreement, including, without
limitation (i) all expenses, including filing fees, in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus
or final prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto, (ii) Commission,
stock exchange and FINRA registration (including any counsel retained in
connection with FINRA registration) and filing fees, (iii) transfer agents
and registrars fees and expenses, (iv) all expenses with respect to road
shows, (v) all fees and expenses incurred in complying with state securities

qualifications of the Registrable Securities as may be set forth in any
underwriting agreement), (vi) all printing, messenger and delivery expenses,
(vii) the fees, charges and expenses of counsel to the Company and of its
independent registered public accounting firm and any other accounting fees,

any expenses arising from any "cold comfort" letters or any special audits
incident to or required by any registration or qualification) and the
reasonable and documented legal fees, charges and expenses of the Designated
Holders Counsel up to a maximum of $50,000 and (viii) any liability insurance
or other premiums for insurance that the Company determines to obtain, if any,
in connection with any Demand Registration or piggy-back registration
thereon, Incidental Registration or S-3 Registration pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, regardless of whether such Registration Statement is declared
effective. All of the expenses described in the preceding sentence of this
Section 8(d) are referred to herein as " _Registration Expenses_." The
Designated Holders of Registrable Securities sold pursuant to a Registration
Statement shall bear the expense of any brokers commission or underwriters
discount or commission relating to the registration and sale of such
Designated Holders Registrable Securities and shall, other than as set forth
in clause (vii) above, bear the fees and expenses of their own counsel.

 



21 9\. Indemnification; Contribution.

 

(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each Designated Holder,
its partners, directors, officers, Affiliates, stockholders, members,
employees, trustees and each Person who controls (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act) such Designated Holder from and against any
and all losses, liabilities and expenses, or any action or proceeding in
respect thereof (including reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), claims and damages, joint or several, to which
they or any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act or
otherwise, including any amount paid in settlement of any litigation commenced
or threatened (each, a " _Liability_ " and collectively, " _Liabilities_ "),
in so far as such Liabilities arise out of or based upon (i) any untrue, or
allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure
Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Free Writing
Prospectus, or in any offering memorandum or other offering document relating
to the offering and sale of such Registrable Securities prepared by the
Company or at its direction, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in
any document incorporated by reference therein; (ii) the omission or alleged
omission to state in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or in any offering memorandum or other
offering document relating to the offering and sale of such
Registrable Securities prepared by the Company or at its direction, or in any
amendment or supplement thereto, or in any document incorporated by reference
therein, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading under the circumstances such statements
were made; and (iii) any violation by the Company of any federal, state or
common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to action
required of or inaction by the Company in connection with any such
registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be held
liable in any such case to the extent that any such Liability arises out of or
is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission contained in such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto in
reliance upon and in conformity with information concerning such Designated
Holder furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Designated
Holder expressly for use therein, including, without limitation, the
information furnished to the Company pursuant to Sections 9(b) hereof. The
Company shall also provide customary indemnities to any underwriters of the
Registrable Securities, their officers, directors and employees and each
Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the
indemnification of the Designated Holders of Registrable Securities.

(b) Indemnification by Designated Holders. In connection with any offering in
which a Designated Holder is participating pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 5
hereof, such Designated Holder agrees severally, and not jointly, to indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the other Designated Holders, any underwriter
retained by the Company and each Person who controls the Company, the other
Designated Holders or such underwriter (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act) to the same extent as Sections 9(a)(i) and (ii) in the
foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Designated Holders (including
indemnification of

 



22  their respective partners, directors, officers, Affiliates, stockholders,
members, employees, trustees and controlling persons), but only to the extent
that Liabilities arise out of or are based upon a statement or alleged
statement or an omission or alleged omission that was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information with respect to such Designated Holder
furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Designated Holder
expressly for use in such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement,
Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus, or in any offering memorandum or other
offering document relating to the offering and sale of such Registrable
Securities prepared by the Company or at its direction, or in any amendment
or supplement thereto, or in any document incorporated by reference therein,
including, without limitation, the information furnished to the Company
pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the total
amount to be indemnified by any such Designated Holder pursuant to this
Section 9(b) shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such Designated
Holder in the offering to which such Disclosure Package, Registration
Statement, Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement
thereto relates.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to
indemnification or contribution hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees
to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any
written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which the Indemnified
Party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder (except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits
substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). If notice of
commencement of any such action is given to the Indemnifying Party as
above provided, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party
similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense,
with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party. Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid
by the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay the
same, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such action
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or (iii) the
named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and such parties have
been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there
may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party. In
any of such cases, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume
the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party, it being
understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all
Indemnified Parties and all such reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses shall be reimbursed as incurred. No Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for any settlement entered into without its written consent. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of such Indemnified Party,
effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of
which such

 



23  Indemnified Party is a party and indemnity has been sought hereunder by such
Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability for claims that are the subject
matter of such proceeding and does not include any admission as to fault or
culpability on the part of such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any time an Indemnified Party shall have requested the
Indemnifying Party to reimburse the Indemnified Party for fees and expenses of
counsel as contemplated by this Section 9, the Indemnifying Party agrees that
it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without the
Indemnifying Partys written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into
more than 30 Business Days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the
aforesaid request and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have reimbursed
the Indemnified Party in accordance with such request or contested the
reasonableness of such fees and expenses prior to the date of such settlement.

 

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 from
the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or
insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Party in respect of any
Liabilities referred to herein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Liabilities in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted in
such Liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or
relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified
Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the Liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 9(a), 9(b) and 9(c)
hereof, any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal or other fees,
charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding; _provided_ , that the total amount to be
contributed by any Designated Holder shall be limited to the net proceeds
(after deducting the underwriters discounts and commissions) received by such
Designated Holder in the offering, less the amount of any damages that such
Designated Holder has otherwise been required to pay as a result of such
Liabilities.

 

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

10\. Rule 144; Restriction Removal.

 

(a) Rule 144. The Company covenants from and after the date hereof that it
shall take such action as may be required from time to time to enable each
Designated Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under
the Securities Act within the

 



24  limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the Securities
Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rules
or regulations hereafter adopted by the Commission The Company shall, upon
the request of any Designated Holder, deliver to such Designated Holder a
written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements;
provided that, in doing so the Company may rely upon any customary
representations of such Designated Holder that the Company may reasonably
require.

(b) Restriction Removal. The Company shall, promptly upon the request of any
holder of Registrable Securities (and, to the extent necessary, the delivery
of such Registrable Securities to the transfer agent therefor), cause any
legend or stop-transfer instructions with respect to restrictions on transfer
under the Securities Act of such Registrable Securities to be removed or
otherwise eliminated if (i) such Registrable Securities are registered
pursuant to an effective Registration Statement, (ii) in connection with a
sale transaction, such holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel,
in a generally acceptable form, to the effect that a public sale, assignment
or transfer of the Registrable Securities may be made without registration
under the Securities Act or (iii) such holder provides the Company reasonable
assurances (by providing an opinion of counsel, in a generally acceptable
form) that the Registrable Securities have been or are being sold pursuant to,
or can then be sold by such holder without restriction or limitation under,
Rule 144. The Company shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of its
transfer agent and The Depository Trust Company associated with the issuance
of the Registrable Securities to the Designated Holder and any legend or
stop-transfer instruction removal or elimination in accordance herewith.

 

11\. Miscellaneous.

(a) Stock Splits, etc. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, reverse splits,
combinations recapitalizations and the like effected, after the date hereof.

 

(b) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company hereby represents and warrants
that it has not previously entered into any agreement granting registration
rights to any Person with respect to any securities of the Company. The
Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that
is inconsistent with or that may otherwise adversely affect the rights granted
to the Designated Holders in this Agreement or grant any additional
registration rights to any Person or with respect to any securities that are
not Registrable Securities which rights are inconsistent with or may otherwise
adversely affect the rights granted to the Designated Holders in this
Agreement.

(c) Remedies. The Designated Holders, in addition to being entitled to
exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, shall be
entitled to specific performance of their rights under this Agreement. The
Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for
any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this
Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 



25 (d) Amendments and Waivers. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented,
and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be
given unless consented to in writing by the Company and the Majority
Designated Holders; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no amendment,
modification, supplement, waiver or consent to depart from the provisions
hereof shall be effective if such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver
or consent to depart from the provisions hereof materially and adversely
affects the substantive rights or obligations of one Designated Holder, or
subset of Designated Holders, without a similar and proportionate effect on
the substantive rights or obligations of all Designated Holders, unless each
such disproportionately affected Designated Holder or group thereof consents
in writing thereto.

and the certain equityholders named therein. All capitalized terms used

ARTICLE II

BOARD REPRESENTATION

Section 2.01 Company Board.

 

(a) The Sellers Representative, acting on behalf of the Initial Preferred
Holders and their Affiliated Transferees (the "Nominating Shareholders")
shall have the right to designate individuals to serve on the Company Board
("Preferred Nominees") pursuant to and subject to the terms of this Section
2.01. Any Preferred Nominee shall meet the requirements set forth in the
"Selection of Directors" criteria in the Companys Corporate Governance
Guidelines in effect from time to time that are applicable to all directors.

 

(b) Upon conversion of Convertible Preferred into Common Shares such that the
Nominating Shareholders own beneficially in the aggregate at least 6.0% of
the Companys aggregate Issued and Outstanding Common Shares, the Nominating
Shareholders shall have the right to designate one Preferred Nominee until
such time as the Nominating Shareholders no longer own beneficially at least
6.0% of the Companys aggregate Issued and Outstanding Common Shares.

(c) Upon conversion of Convertible Preferred into Common Shares such that the
Nominating Shareholders own beneficially in the aggregate at least 10.0% of
the Companys aggregate Issued and Outstanding Common Shares, the Nominating
Shareholders shall have the right to designate one additional Preferred
Nominee (for a total of two Preferred Nominees) until such time as the
Nominating Shareholders no longer own beneficially at least 10.0% of the
Companys aggregate Issued and Outstanding Common Shares.

 

(d) After conversion of Convertible Preferred reaching the thresholds set
forth in Sections 2.01(b) or 2.01(c) above, as applicable, the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Nominating Shareholders, may (but shall not
be required to) designate a Preferred Nominee or Preferred Nominees (as
applicable) in writing to the Company. The Company Board then shall promptly
adopt a resolution to increase the size of the Company Board (and/or

 



3  seek the resignation of a director, but only if the maximum number of
directors specified in Section 5 of the Companys Articles of Amalgamation, as
amended, would be exceeded by the appointment of such Preferred Nominee) to
accommodate such Preferred Nominee(s) and to appoint to the Company Board such
Preferred Nominee(s) until the Companys next annual meeting. Beginning with
such next annual meeting of the Companys shareholders or at any meeting of
the shareholders of the Company at which directors of the Company Board are to
be elected, the Company will include in the slate of directors recommended for
election by the Company Board to the shareholders of the Company such
Preferred Nominee(s) (or substitute Preferred Nominee(s) designated by the
Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Nominating Shareholders), and will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all action necessary
(including recommending that the Companys shareholders vote in favor of such
Preferred Nominee(s)) to cause such person(s) to be elected by the
shareholders of the Company as a director of the Company Board.
Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, if a Preferred
Nominee is included in managements slate of directors but is not elected by
the shareholders, the Company Board shall not be required to appoint such
individual Preferred Nominee after the shareholder meeting;  _provided_ ,
that this sentence shall not limit the Companys or the Company Boards
obligations hereunder with respect to the election of a Preferred Nominee at
the next meeting of shareholders of the Company.

 

(e) In the event of the resignation, death, removal, disqualification or
failure to be elected of a director nominated by the Sellers Representative,
on behalf of the Nominating Shareholders, in accordance with this Section
2.01, the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Nominating Shareholders,
may designate a replacement nominee, and the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such person to be appointed to the
Company Board. Any director nominated by the Sellers Representative, on
behalf of the Nominating Shareholders, in accordance with this Section 2.01
may not be removed or replaced at any time by the Company or the Company Board
except for cause or as required by Applicable Law.

 

(f) If the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Nominating Shareholders,
no longer has the right to designate a Preferred Nominee under Sections
2.01(b) or (c), as applicable, the Sellers Representative shall instruct the
Preferred Nominee serving on the Company Board pursuant to the rights granted
by such Section to tender his or her resignation from the Company Board as
specified in the Companys by-laws within two Business Days after receipt of a
written request from the Company to so resign.

 

(g) Reasonable costs and expenses incurred by a Preferred Nominee for the
purposes of attending Company Board (or committee) meetings will be paid by
the Company.

(h) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.01(h), if at any
time after the date hereof, the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the
Nominating Shareholders, is not entitled to nominate (or elects not to
nominate) a Preferred Designee or the Company Board does not include at least
one Preferred Nominee for any reason, then, without limiting any other rights
of the Sellers Representative in the case of any breach of this Agreement by
the Company or the Company Board, the Sellers Representative acting on behalf
of the Nominating Shareholders shall have the right to appoint one non-voting
observer (an "Observer") to the Company Board, who shall (i) be provided by
the Company with all notices of meetings, consents, minutes and other written
materials that are provided to the

 



4  Company Board or any committee thereof at the same time as such materials
are provided to the Company Board or such committee, as applicable, and (ii)
be entitled to attend all meetings of the Company Board and any committee
thereof; provided, that the Observer shall have no right to participate in
discussions at any such meetings unless requested by the Company Board, and
provided further, that the Observer may be excluded from access to any
material or meeting or portion thereof if the Company Board determines in good
faith, upon advice of counsel, that such exclusion is reasonably necessary to
preserve the attorney-client privilege. Reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Observer for the purposes of attending Company Board (or
committee) meetings will be paid by the Company. As a condition of his or her
appointment, the Observer shall enter into a confidentiality and non-
disclosure agreement with the Company in a customary form reasonably
acceptable to the Company Board and the Observer. The Observer rights
contemplated by this Section 2.01(h) shall expire on the earliest to occur of
(i) the Companys redemption of all Preferred Shares, (ii) the appointment or
election of the director contemplated by Section 2.01(b), or (iii) the date on
which this Agreement terminates.

 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, the rights set forth in this Agreement
supplement the terms of the Articles of Amalgamation of the Company and are
without limitation to any rights the Sellers Representative or the Initial
Preferred Holders may have as holders of Preferred Shares or Common Shares
pursuant to the Articles of Amalgamation or otherwise.

 

ARTICLE III

ACTION BY SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE

Section 3.01 Sellers Representative. Any action that may be taken by any
Initial Preferred Holder, its Affiliated Transferee(s) or the Nominating
Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken only by the Sellers
Representative. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers
Representative shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of
all Initial Preferred Holders, their respective Affiliated Transferee(s) or
the Nominating Shareholders, as the case may be, and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each such Initial Preferred Holder, Affiliated Transferee
and Nominating Shareholder. Parent may conclusively rely upon, without
independent verification or investigation, any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Sellers Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of every Initial Preferred Holder, Affiliated
Transferee and Nominating Shareholder, and the Company shall not be liable in
any manner whatsoever for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon
the Sellers Representative.

ARTICLE IV

(c) upon the agreement in writing of the Sellers Representative and the
Company.
