STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and effective as of
March 28, 2018 (the "Agreement Date") by and among Plantronics, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Buyer"); Triangle Private Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("Seller"); and Polycom, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Polycom"). Capitalized terms used but not defined in the context
of the Section in which such terms first appear have the respective meanings
set forth in Section 13.17.

WHEREAS, Polycom and each of its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule A‑1 (Polycom
and each such company, each a "Polycom Company" and, collectively including
Polycom, the "Polycom Companies") are engaged in the development, manufacture,
sale, distribution and delivery of, and providing support services relating
to, unified communications and collaboration software and hardware systems for
voice, video and content sharing for distributors, service providers and end-
user customers (the "Polycom Business");

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock
of Polycom (the "Shares"); and

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase the Shares from Seller, and Seller desires
to sell the Shares to Buyer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows: 

1.PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer,
and Buyer shall purchase and acquire from Seller, all of the Shares, free and
clear of all Liens (other than any Liens arising pursuant to applicable
federal and state securities Laws, Liens arising as a result of actions solely
taken by Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates, and Liens contemplated by
the Financing).

2. PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT

2.1. Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares (the
"Purchase Price") shall be (i) an amount equal to One Billion Six Hundred
Thirty Eight Million One Hundred Seventy Two Thousand Two Hundred Seventy
Eight and 84/100 Dollars ($1,638,172,278.84) (as such amount may be adjusted
pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), the "Base Cash Purchase Price"); plus (A) the
Final Cash Amount; plus (B) the amount, if any, by which the Final Adjusted
Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Upper Adjusted Net Working Capital
Target or minus (C) the amount, if any, by which the Final Adjusted Net
Working Capital Amount is less than the Lower Adjusted Net Working Capital
Target; minus (D) the Final Indebtedness Amount; minus (E) the Final Polycom
Transaction Expense Amount; and (ii) 6,352,201 shares of Buyer Common Stock
(as such amount may be adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.1 and Section 2.11,
the "Closing Stock Consideration"), provided, however, that if on the Closing
Date the Closing Stock Consideration would exceed 19.9% of the then
outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock, then the Closing Stock Consideration
shall be reduced by an amount of shares necessary for the Closing Stock
Consideration to not exceed 19.9% of the then outstanding shares of Buyer
Common Stock as of the Effective Time and the amount of the Base Cash Purchase
Price shall be increased by the product of (I) $56.96 and (II) the number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock comprising the Closing Stock Consideration as of
the Agreement Date minus the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock comprising
the Closing Stock Consideration as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall Buyer be obligated to issue a number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock under this Agreement equal to more than 19.9% of the
outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock measured as of the time of issuance
of the Closing Stock Consideration.

2.2. Estimated Closing Statement. Not less than four (4) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date (or two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date with
respect to Section 2.2(b)), Polycom shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and deliver to Buyer:

(a) A statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth Seller's
good faith estimate of each of the following, together with reasonably
detailed documentation supporting each estimate: (i) the amount of Cash as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Estimated Cash Amount"); (i) the
amount of Adjusted Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount"); (i) the
aggregate amount of all Polycom Indebtedness outstanding and unpaid as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Estimated Indebtedness Amount"),
including a breakdown of the aggregate amount of all Paid-Off Indebtedness
outstanding and unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Estimated Paid-Off Indebtedness Amount") and the aggregate amount of all
Retained 

Indebtedness outstanding and unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Estimated Retained Indebtedness Amount"); and (i) the aggregate
amount of all Polycom Transaction Expenses outstanding and unpaid as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Estimated Polycom Transaction
Expense Amount"). The Estimated Closing Statement shall also set forth the
amount and calculation of the "Estimated Closing Date Cash Purchase Price,"
which shall be equal to the sum of (A) the Base Cash Purchase Price, plus (B)
the Estimated Cash Amount, plus (C) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Upper Adjusted Net Working
Capital Target or minus (D) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount is less than the Lower Adjusted Net
Working Capital Target, minus (E) the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, and minus
(F) the Estimated Polycom Transaction Expense Amount. After delivery of the
Estimated Closing Statement, Polycom shall (1) reasonably cooperate Buyer and
its representatives in Buyer's review of the Estimated Closing Statement, and
(2) give Buyer reasonable access to and copies of the books and records of
Polycom and its Subsidiaries and reasonable access to relevant personnel
thereof (including any auditors or accountants) for the purpose of reviewing
the Estimated Closing Statement provided that the confidentiality of all such
books and records shall be strictly maintained by all such persons in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Polycom and Seller shall
consider in good faith any comments on the Estimated Closing Statement
submitted by Buyer; provided that in the event Buyer and Polycom are unable to
agree regarding any of the matters and/or amounts set forth on the Estimated
Closing Statement, such matters and amounts set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement delivered by Polycom and Seller shall be used for the purpose of the
payment set forth in Section 2.3.

(b) A schedule of the respective amounts, payees/obligees and wire transfer
instructions with respect to (i) each item of Paid-Off Indebtedness included
within the calculation of the Estimated Paid-Off Indebtedness Amount and (ii)
each Polycom Transaction Expense included within the calculation of the
Estimated Polycom Transaction Expense Amount, in each case, as set forth on
the Estimated Closing Statement.

(c) Payoff letters, lien terminations (including UCC‑3 financing statements),
releases, instruments of discharge and similar documentation, in each case in
customary form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, to be executed and delivered
as of the Closing by each of the obligees identified pursuant to Section
2.2(b), which shall include, if applicable, such obligees' release, upon
payment at Closing (or replacement, cash collateralization or backstop of
existing letters of credit), of all Liens of such obligees over the properties
and assets of each Polycom Company (other than any cash that is used to cash
collateralize existing letters of credit, if applicable) and the Shares (the
"Payoff Letters") and shall evidence the repayment or prepayment of all Paid-
off Indebtedness (other than for customary indemnity obligations that
expressly survive by their terms). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its
representatives shall be permitted a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the drafts and execution versions of any such documentation.

2.3. Closing Payments. 

(a) Payment of Estimated Paid-Off Indebtedness Amount. At the Closing, Buyer
shall deliver and pay to the applicable obligees, for and on behalf of the
Polycom Companies, each item of Paid-Off Indebtedness included within the
calculation of the Estimated Paid-Off Indebtedness Amount.

(b) Payment of Estimated Polycom Transaction Expense Amount. At the Closing,
Buyer shall deliver and pay to the applicable obligees, for and on behalf of
the Polycom Companies, each Polycom Transaction Expense included within the
calculation of the Estimated Polycom Transaction Expense Amount, in full
satisfaction and retirement of all Polycom Transaction Expenses outstanding
and unpaid as of the Closing, as set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement.

(c) Payment and Delivery of Closing Date Balance. At the Closing, Buyer shall
pay and deliver the Estimated Closing Date Cash Purchase Price as follows:

(i) Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) (the "LandR Matters Escrow Amount")
shall be deposited into the LandR Matters Account; and

(ii) An amount equal to the Estimated Closing Date Cash Purchase Price minus
the LandR Matters Escrow Amount shall be paid to Seller.

(d) Delivery of Closing Stock Consideration. At the Closing, Buyer shall
deliver certificates evidencing the Closing Stock Consideration (or at Buyer's
election in non-certificated book-entry form to Escrow Agent's or Seller's, as
applicable, designated account), with a restrictive legend as set forth in
Section 3.7(e), as follows:

(i) Such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate value of One
Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000), based on a price per share equal to
the average closing price of Buyer Common Stock for the twenty (20)
consecutive Trading Days prior to the Closing Date, to be deposited by Buyer
into the General Escrow Account (the "Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration");
and

(ii) the balance of the Closing Stock Consideration to Seller (the "Paid
Closing Stock Consideration").

2.4. Post-Closing Reconciliation.

(a) Preliminary Closing Statement. Not more than seventy-five (75) days
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
deliver to Seller a statement (the "Preliminary Closing Statement") setting
forth Buyer's calculation of each of the following, together with reasonably
detailed documentation supporting each calculation: (i) the amount of Cash as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Preliminary Cash Amount");
(i) the amount of Adjusted Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Preliminary Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount"); (i)
the aggregate amount of all Polycom Indebtedness outstanding and unpaid as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Preliminary Indebtedness
Amount"), including a breakdown of the aggregate amount of all Paid-Off
Indebtedness outstanding and unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Preliminary Paid-Off Indebtedness Amount") and the aggregate amount
of all Retained Indebtedness outstanding and unpaid as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "Preliminary Retained Indebtedness Amount"); and (i)
the aggregate amount of all Polycom Transaction Expenses outstanding and
unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Preliminary Polycom
Transaction Expense Amount"). The Preliminary Closing Statement shall also set
forth Buyer's calculation of the amount of the "Preliminary Closing Date Cash
Purchase Price", which shall be equal to the sum of (A) the Base Cash Purchase
Price, plus (B) the Preliminary Cash Amount, plus (C) the amount, if any, by
which the Preliminary Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Upper
Adjusted Net Working Capital Target or minus (D) the amount, if any, by which
the Preliminary Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount is less than the Lower
Adjusted Net Working Capital Target, minus (E) the Preliminary Indebtedness
Amount, and minus (F) the Preliminary Polycom Transaction Expense Amount.

(b) Objection to Preliminary Closing Statement. After the Preliminary Closing
Statement is delivered to Seller pursuant to Section 2.4(a), Seller shall have
fifty (50) days (the "Response Period") to review and respond to the
Preliminary Closing Statement in accordance with this Section 2.4(b). If
Seller objects to any of the amounts or calculations set forth on the
Preliminary Closing Statement, then Seller shall inform Buyer on or before the
last day of the Response Period by delivering written notice to Buyer (a
"Closing Statement Objection") setting forth a specific description of the
basis of the Closing Statement Objection and the proposed adjustments to the
Preliminary Closing Statement that Seller believes should be made. If no
Closing Statement Objection is delivered to Buyer within the Response Period,
then Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Preliminary Closing Statement
for all purposes hereunder.

(c) Response to Closing Statement Objection. If a Closing Statement Objection
is delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4(b), then Buyer shall have
fifteen (15) days following the delivery of the Closing Statement Objection
(the "Rebuttal Period") to review and respond to the Closing Statement
Objection by delivering written notice to Seller specifying the scope of its
disagreement with the information contained in the Closing Statement
Objection. If no such written notice is delivered to Seller within the
Rebuttal Period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Statement Objection for all purposes hereunder.

(d) Dispute Resolution Following Closing Statement Objection.

(i) If Buyer delivers a written notice to Seller in response to a Closing
Statement Objection pursuant to Section 2.4(c), then Buyer and Seller shall
promptly meet (in person, by telephone or any other mutually convenient medium
agreed upon by the Parties) and attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute
or disagreement relating to the Preliminary Closing Statement, the amount and
calculation of the Preliminary Closing Date Cash Purchase Price or the amount
and calculation of any of the amounts set forth in Section 2.4(a) (a "Closing
Statement Dispute").

(ii) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve the Closing Statement Dispute
within thirty (30) days following Buyer's delivery of written notice to Seller
pursuant to Section 2.4(c), then, at any time thereafter, Buyer or Seller may
elect to have the Closing Statement Dispute resolved by Ernst and Young LLP or
another nationally or regionally recognized firm of independent public
accountants as to which Buyer and Seller mutually agree, and in either case as
to which all of the Parties represent that they have not otherwise engaged
such firm in the two (2) years prior to this engagement (the "CPA Firm"),
which firm shall, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator (provided that,
absent manifest error, the final decision of the CPA Firm shall be binding
upon and enforceable by the Parties in the same manner as though rendered in
binding arbitration), resolve the Closing Statement Dispute on the basis of
the standards, methods and procedures set forth in this Agreement and
otherwise according to the rules and procedures set forth in an engagement
letter to be entered into between Buyer, Seller and the CPA Firm (the
"Engagement Letter"). The Engagement Letter shall provide that: (A) the scope
of the resolution conducted by the CPA Firm shall be limited solely to the
Closing Statement Dispute and that the CPA Firm shall not conduct a review of
or render a decision on any other items; (B) the CPA Firm shall deliver to
Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any event within the
timelines specified in the Engagement Letter, a written report setting forth
the final value of each item included within the Closing Statement Dispute,
which shall be the position of either Buyer or Seller, or a position between
the positions of Buyer and Seller, and may not be an alternative resolution;
and (C) the CPA Firm shall make its determination based solely on the
guidelines, definitions and procedures set forth in this Agreement and the
material provided by Buyer and Seller and not pursuant to any independent
review and without regard to any objections of Seller that are not described
in the Closing Statement Objection. Absent manifest error, the determination
of the CPA Firm shall be final and binding on the Parties, shall be non-
appealable and may be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(iii) All fees and expenses of the CPA Firm in connection with the services
provided pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(ii) shall be paid by Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in proportion to the amounts by which
their respective aggregate positions in the Closing Statement Dispute differed
from the CPA Firm's final aggregate determination.

(e) Final Closing Statement. The actual and final amount of Cash as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Final Cash Amount"), the actual
and final amount of Adjusted Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "Final Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount"), the
actual and final aggregate amount of Polycom Indebtedness (including the
actual and final breakdown of the aggregate amount of Paid-Off Indebtedness
and the aggregate amount of Retained Indebtedness) outstanding and unpaid as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Final Indebtedness Amount"),
and the actual and final amount of Polycom Transaction Expenses outstanding
and unpaid as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Final Polycom
Transaction Expense Amount") will be:

(i) as stated in the Preliminary Closing Statement, with respect to any items
thereon as to which Seller fails to deliver a Closing Statement Objection
during the Response Period;

(ii) as stated in the Preliminary Closing Statement as adjusted by the Closing
Statement Objection, if a Closing Statement Objection is delivered by Seller
and Buyer does not deliver written notice to Seller within the Rebuttal
Period;

(iii) as determined by the CPA Firm as provided in Section 2.4(d)(ii), with
respect to any items on the Preliminary Closing Statement as to which Seller
delivers a Closing Statement Objection during the Response Period and Buyer
delivers written notice to Seller within the Rebuttal Period; or

(iv) notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), as mutually
agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller.

The "Final Closing Statement" shall mean the Preliminary Closing Statement, if
Seller does not deliver any Closing Statement Objection during the Response
Period, or the Preliminary Closing Statement as adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.4(e) if Seller delivers a Closing Statement Objection during the
Response Period. The Final Closing Statement shall set forth the amount and
calculation of the "Final Closing Date Cash Purchase Price," which shall be
equal to the sum of (A) the Base Cash Purchase Price, (B) plus the Final Cash
Amount, (C) plus the amount, if any, by which the Final Adjusted Net Working
Capital Amount exceeds the Upper Adjusted Net Working Capital Target or minus
the amount, if any, by which the Final Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount is
less than the Lower Adjusted Net Working Capital Target, (D) minus the Final
Indebtedness Amount, and (E) minus the Final Polycom Transaction Expense
Amount.

2.5. Payment of Final Cash Purchase Price Adjustment. If the Final Closing
Date Cash Purchase Price, as set forth on the Final Closing Statement, is less
than the Estimated Closing Date Cash Purchase Price, as set forth on the
Estimated Closing Statement, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the difference between the Estimated Closing Date Cash Purchase Price and the
Final Closing Date Cash Purchase. If the Final Closing Date Cash Purchase
Price, as set forth on the Final Closing Statement, is greater than the
Estimated Closing Date Cash Purchase Price, as set forth on the Estimated
Closing Statement, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
difference between the Final Closing Date Cash Purchase Price and the
Estimated Closing Date Cash Purchase Price. Any payment required by this
Section 2.5 shall be made within five (5) Business Days after determination of
the Final Closing Statement.

2.6. Escrow Arrangement.

(a) Payments to Buyer Indemnified Parties. The Escrowed Closing Stock
Consideration and the LandR Matters Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow to
satisfy, at least in part, claims made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
satisfaction of any indemnification claim in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 2.6 and Article 10. The Escrow Agent will
hold the Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration and the LandR Matters Escrow
Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If Seller becomes
obligated (whether through mutual agreement between Buyer and Seller, as a
result of a final non-appealable judicial determination or otherwise finally
determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) to make a payment
to Buyer or another Buyer Indemnified Party from the General Escrow Account
and/or the LandR Matters Escrow Account (such dollar amount, as finally
determined from time to time pursuant to this Agreement, an "Indemnification
Escrow Claim Dollar Amount"), then Buyer and Seller shall promptly execute and
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer or
another Buyer Indemnified Party (x) with respect to the General Escrow
Account, (A) first, an amount in cash (the "Released General Escrow Funds
Amount") equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of General Escrow Funds then
existing in the General Escrow Account and (2) the Indemnification Escrow
Claim Dollar Amount and (B) second, to the extent the Released General Escrow
Funds Amount is less than the Indemnification Escrow Claim Dollar Amount, a
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock from the General Escrow Account (equal
to the lesser of (i) (x) the applicable Indemnification Escrow Claim Dollar
Amount minus the applicable Released General Escrow Funds Amount divided by
(y) the average closing price of Buyer Common Stock for the twenty (20)
consecutive Trading Days prior to the date that the Escrow Agent actually
releases and transfers such amount of Buyer Common Stock to Buyer or another
Buyer Indemnified Party, as applicable, or (ii) the number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock then existing in the General Escrow Account, and/or (y) with
respect to the LandR Matters Escrow Account, an amount to Buyer or another Buyer
Indemnified Party equal to the lesser of the Indemnification Escrow Claim
Dollar Amount to be paid from the LandR Matters Escrow Account and the amount of
funds then existing in the LandR Matters Escrow Account.

(b) Release of LandR Matters Escrow Amount and Retained LandR Matters Escrowed
Closing Stock Consideration in Certain Circumstances to Seller.

(i) If (A) the LandR Matters Completion Date occurs before the General Escrow
Release Date and (B) no indemnification claim or claims have been made by a
Buyer Indemnified Party against the LandR Matters Escrow Account and/or the
Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration under Article 10 or
no such claim(s) remain(s) outstanding on the General Escrow Release Date,
then the following will apply: promptly following the LandR Matters Completion
Date, in the event that no claim for indemnification under Article 10 by a
Buyer Indemnified Party has been made and remains outstanding against the LandR
Matters Escrow Account, Buyer and Seller shall promptly execute and deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute to Seller fifty
percent (50%) of the remainder of the LandR Matters Escrow Amount, if any. If,
on the LandR Matters Completion Date, an indemnification claim or claims has
been made by a Buyer Indemnified Party against the LandR Matters Escrow Account
under Article 10 and such claim(s) remain(s) outstanding on such date, but the
maximum potential obligation of Seller in respect of such claim(s) is
reasonably identifiable and not subject to further dispute and is less than
the remainder of the LandR Matters Escrow Amount, then Buyer and Seller shall
promptly execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Seller from the LandR Matters Escrow Account an amount equal to
(x) fifty percent (50%) multiplied by (y) the sum of (1) the remainder of the
LandR Matters Escrow Amount, minus (2) such identifiable maximum potential
obligation of Seller in respect of such claim(s). Once all pending claims have
been resolved and satisfied from the LandR Matters Escrow Account, Buyer and
Seller shall promptly and jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release fifty
percent (50%) of the amount of such resolved claims then remaining in the LandR
Matters Escrow Account to Seller, with the remainder of the LandR Matters Escrow
Account distributed to Seller as set forth on Schedule 13.17(eee).

(ii) If (A) the LandR Matters Completion Date occurs after the General Escrow
Release Date and no claim for indemnification under Article 10 by a Buyer
Indemnified Party has been made and remains outstanding against the LandR
Matters Escrow Account or the Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock
Consideration, or (B) the LandR Matters Completion Date occurs after the General
Escrow Release Date but an indemnification claim or claims has been made by a
Buyer Indemnified Party against the LandR Matters Escrow Account and/or the
Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration under Article 10 and
such claim(s) remain(s) outstanding on the General Escrow Release Date, then
the following will apply: Promptly following the LandR Matters Completion Date,
in the event that no claim for indemnification under Article 10 by a Buyer
Indemnified Party has been made and remains outstanding against the LandR
Matters Escrow Account or the Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock
Consideration, Buyer and Seller shall promptly execute and deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute to Seller fifty percent
(50%) of the remainder of the LandR Matters Escrow Amount and fifty percent
(50%) of the Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration, if
any. The remainder of the LandR Matters Escrow Account and the Retained LandR
Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration will be distributed to Seller as
set forth on Schedule 13.17(eee). If, on the LandR Matters Completion Date, an
indemnification claim or claims has been made by a Buyer Indemnified Party
against the LandR Matters Escrow Account and/or the Retained LandR Matters
Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration under Article 10 and such claim(s)
remain(s) outstanding on such date, but the maximum potential obligation of
Seller in respect of such claim(s) is reasonably identifiable and not subject
to further dispute and is less than the remainder of the sum of the LandR
Matters Escrow Amount and the Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock
Consideration, then Buyer and Seller shall promptly execute and deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute to Seller, first from
the Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration (valuing shares
of Buyer Common Stock based on the average closing price of Buyer Common Stock
for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days prior to the LandR Matters
Completion Date) and then from the LandR Matters Escrow Account an amount equal
to (x) fifty percent (50%) multiplied by (y) the sum of (1) the remainder of
the LandR Matters Escrow Amount and the Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing
Stock Consideration, minus (2) such identifiable maximum potential obligation
of Seller in respect of such claim(s). Once all pending claims have been
resolved and satisfied from the LandR Matters Escrow Account and the Retained
LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration, Buyer and Seller shall
promptly and jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release fifty percent (50%) of
the amount of such resolved claims then remaining in the LandR Matters Escrow
Account and the Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration to
Seller. The remainder of the LandR Matters Escrow Account and the Retained LandR
Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration will be distributed to the Seller
as set forth on Schedule 13.17(eee).

(c) Release of Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration and Retained LandR Matters
Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration in Certain Circumstances to Seller. On
the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "General Escrow
Release Date"), in the event that no claim for indemnification under Article
10 by a Buyer Indemnified Party has been made and remains outstanding against
the General Escrow Account, Buyer and Seller shall promptly execute and
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute to Seller
the remainder of the General Escrow Funds and the Escrowed Closing Stock
Consideration; provided, however, if the General Escrow Release Date precedes
the LandR Matters Completion Date, then the joint written instruction delivered
by Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to retain from the General
Escrow Account, (i) 100% of the General Escrow Funds (such amount, the
"Retained General Escrow Funds Amount") and (ii) from the Escrowed Closing
Stock Consideration, the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock having a value
equal to the sum of (x) Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) minus (y)
the Retained General Escrow Funds Amount, based on the average closing price
of Buyer Common Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days prior to
the General Escrow Release Date (such shares, the "Retained LandR Matters
Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration"), which such retained General Escrow
Funds and Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration shall
continue to be held in the General Escrow Account and only disbursed to Seller
following the LandR Matters Completion Date as set forth in Section 2.6(b)(ii).
If, on the General Escrow Release Date, an indemnification claim or claims
("Pending Claims") has been made by a Buyer Indemnified Party against the
General Escrow Account under Article 10 and such claim(s) remain(s)
outstanding on such date, but the maximum potential obligation of Seller in
respect of such claim(s) is reasonably identifiable and not subject to further
dispute and is less than the aggregate value of the sum of the General Escrow
Funds and the Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration (based on the average
closing price of Buyer Common Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading
Days prior to the General Escrow Release Date), then Buyer and Seller shall
promptly execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Seller from the Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration, the number
of shares of Buyer Common Stock having a value equal to (w) the aggregate
value of the remainder of the Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration, plus (x)
the amount then remaining of the General Escrow Funds minus (y) such
identifiable maximum potential obligation of Seller in respect of each such
claim (the "Escrow Reserve Amount"), minus (z) if the General Escrow Release
Date precedes the LandR Matters Completion Date, the Retained LandR Matters
Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration, based on the average closing price of
Buyer Common Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days prior to the
General Escrow Release Date. Thereafter, as any pending indemnification claim
is resolved, Buyer and Seller shall promptly and jointly direct the Escrow
Agent to distribute to (i) Buyer, (A) first, from the General Escrow Funds,
the Released General Escrow Funds Amount, and (B) second, the number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock from the remainder of the Escrowed Closing Stock
Consideration having a value equal to the applicable Indemnification Escrow
Claim Dollar Amount minus the Released General Escrow Funds Amount based on
the average closing price of Buyer Common Stock for the twenty (20)
consecutive Trading Days prior to the date that the Escrow Agent actually
releases and transfers such amount of Buyer Common Stock to Buyer or another
Buyer Indemnified Party, as applicable, provided, however, that any Retained
LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration shall continue to be held by
the Escrow Agent until released pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(ii) and (ii) Seller
(after taking into account such distribution to Buyer), (A) first, the number
of shares of Buyer Common Stock from the remainder of the Escrowed Closing
Stock Consideration having a value (based on the average closing price of
Buyer Common Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days prior to the
date that the Escrow Agent actually releases and transfers such amount of
Buyer Common Stock) equal to the positive amount, if any, of the sum of (1)
the aggregate value of the remainder of the Escrowed Closing Stock
Consideration plus (2) the amount then remaining of the General Escrow Funds
minus (3) the aggregate Escrow Reserve Amount with respect to the remaining
Pending Claims, if any, based on the average closing price of Buyer Common
Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days prior to the date that the
Escrow Agent actually releases and transfers such amount of Buyer Common Stock
to Seller. Once all pending claims have been resolved and satisfied from the
General Escrow Account, Buyer and Seller shall promptly and jointly direct the
Escrow Agent to release the remainder of the General Escrow Funds and the
Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration to Seller; provided, however, that any
Retained LandR Matters Escrowed Closing Stock Consideration shall continue to be
held by the Escrow Agent until released pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(ii).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, all claims made against and distributions
directed from the General Escrow Account and the LandR Matters Escrow Account
shall be made pursuant to the terms of Article 10, including but not limited
to the waterfall described in Section 10.5.

(e) The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent with respect to the General
Escrow Account and the LandR Matters Escrow Account shall be borne equally by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, jointly and severally, on the other hand.

2.7. Accounting Principles and Methodologies. Each of the Estimated Closing
Statement, Preliminary Closing Statement and Final Closing Statement shall be
prepared in a manner consistent in all respects with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and, to the extent
consistent with GAAP, using the same accounting methods, policies, practices,
principles and procedures, with consistent classifications and valuation and
estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Polycom
Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end of the Polycom
Companies (the "Accounting Principles and Methodologies"). An illustrative
example of the calculation of net working capital in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and Methodologies is set forth on Schedule 2.7.

2.8. Method of Payment. All cash payments pursuant to this Article 2 shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account that the
recipient has designated in writing.

2.9. Access to Information. Following the Closing until the determination of
the Final Closing Statement, Buyer will (a) reasonably cooperate with Seller
and its representatives in Seller's review of the Preliminary Closing
Statement, and (b) permit Seller and its representatives (including their
accountants and attorneys), during normal business hours upon reasonable prior
notice and without interruption to the Polycom Business, to have reasonable
access to the books and records of the Polycom Companies necessary to review
the Preliminary Closing Statement, provided that the confidentiality of all
such books and records shall be strictly maintained by all such Persons in
accordance with Section 7.4.

2.10. Withholding. Buyer and Seller shall each be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable under this Agreement any withholding of Taxes
or other similar amounts required under applicable Tax Law to be deducted and
withheld, and Buyer and Seller, as applicable, shall pay such amounts to the
appropriate authorities. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid. To the extent that Buyer or Seller becomes aware of any
applicable withholding Taxes, Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, (i) shall
use reasonable efforts to provide prompt written notice to the other of the
amount of such Tax and (ii) shall use reasonable efforts to consult with the
other in good faith as to the nature of the Tax and the basis upon which such
withholding is required.

2.11. Certain Adjustments. Without limiting the provisions of this Agreement,
if, from the Agreement Date until the Effective Time, the shares of Buyer
Common Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares, or similar transaction, the Closing Stock Consideration and any
items on which the calculation of the Closing Stock Consideration depends, as
the case may be, shall be correspondingly adjusted as appropriate to provide
the holders of the shares of Buyer Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

2.12. Transaction Expense Tax Benefits. In addition to the payments payable by
Buyer to Seller under this Article 2, to the extent that any cash Tax benefits
are realized by Buyer or the Polycom Companies with respect to any Tax period
(other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period) ending before January 1, 2021 in respect
of Polycom Transaction Expenses or Specified Expenses, Buyer shall pay to
Seller in cash the amount of such net Tax benefits actually realized
(calculated on an "with and without" basis, net of reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses) (it being understood that this clause shall
apply only with respect to any Tax deductions resulting from Polycom
Transaction Expenses or Specified Expenses that in the aggregate amount to at
least $5,000,000 in a fiscal year).

this Agreement and the other documents and instruments to be executed and
delivered by Seller pursuant hereto and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by the managing
member of Seller. No other or further corporate act or proceeding on the part
of Seller or its equity holders is necessary to authorize this Agreement or
the other documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by Seller

3.3. Ownership. No shares of the capital stock of Polycom are issued or
outstanding except for 100,100 shares of common stock, which are all owned of
record and beneficially by Seller. Seller owns (of record and beneficially)

3.4. No Violation.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4(a), or (other than with respect to
clause (i)), as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other documents
and instruments to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant hereby or
thereby, and assuming the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to
in Section 3.4(b) are obtained, none of the execution and delivery by Seller
of this Agreement and the other documents and instruments to be executed and
delivered by it pursuant hereto, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and compliance by Seller with any of the
provisions hereof or thereof will conflict with, or result in any violation of
or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or result
in the creation of any Lien under, give rise to a right of termination,
modification, acceleration or cancellation under, or require any prepayment,
repurchase, redemption, defeasance, discharge or other satisfaction of any
Seller Indebtedness or require an offer to be made to prepay, repurchase,
redeem, defease, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Seller Indebtedness under
any provision of (i) the Organizational Documents of Seller; (ii) any Order of
any Governmental Authority applicable to Seller or by which any of the
properties or assets of Seller are bound; (iii) any applicable Law; or (iv)
any Contract to which Seller is a party or by which Seller or any of its
properties, assets or rights may be bound or affected.

(b) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.4(b), no consent, waiver, approval,
Order, Permit or authorization of, or declaration or filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Authority is required on the part of Seller
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other

Laws as set forth in Schedule 3.4(b)(ii), the issuance of consents,
authorizations or approvals of such applications by such authorities, if
required, and the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods
thereunder, (i) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, and any other applicable Securities Law, and (i) except
as would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Seller to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other documents and
instruments to be executed and delivered by Seller pursuant hereby or thereby.

3.5. No Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.5, there is no material
Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller
or Seller's respective directors, managers or officers or foreign equivalents
(in such capacities) that seeks to prevent, restrain, prohibit or make illegal
the transactions contemplated hereby.

3.6. No Brokers or Finders. Neither Seller nor any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents have retained any broker or finder in connection with the
transactions provided for herein or in connection with the negotiation
thereof, nor are any of them responsible for the payment of any broker's or
finder's fees.

3.7. Investment Representations.

(a) Offering Exemption. Seller understands that the shares of Buyer Common
Stock to be acquired by Seller pursuant to this Agreement have not been
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or qualified under any state
securities Laws and that such shares of Buyer Common Stock are being offered
and sold pursuant to an exemption from such registration and qualification
based in part upon the representations contained herein. Seller is an
"accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) under the U.S.
Securities Act.

(b) Knowledge and Experience; Ability to Bear Risks. Seller has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that Seller is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the investment contemplated by this
Agreement, and Seller is able to bear the economic risk of this investment in
the shares of Buyer Common Stock that may be delivered to Seller or held in
escrow pursuant to this Agreement (including a complete loss of Seller's
investment or a reduction in the price of Buyer Common Stock, whether at the
time it is held by Seller or while such Buyer Common Stock is held in the
General Escrow Account).

(c) Investment Purpose. Seller is acquiring the shares of Buyer Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement solely for Seller's own account for investment and
not with a view toward the resale or distribution thereof, nor with any
present intention of transferring or distributing Seller's interest in such
shares of Buyer Common Stock, in each case in a manner that would require
registration of such shares of Buyer Common Stock prior to such registration
under the Stockholders' Agreement. Seller has no contract, undertaking,
agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer, assign or pledge
to such person or anyone else all or any part of the shares of Buyer Common
Stock being issued under this Agreement, and Seller has no current plans or
intentions to enter into any such contract, undertaking or arrangement, in
each case in a manner that would require registration of such shares of Buyer
Common Stock prior to such registration under the Stockholders Agreement.

(d) Resale Restrictions. Seller acknowledges that the shares of Buyer Common
Stock that Seller may acquire pursuant to this Agreement (i) have not been
registered under the Securities Act or the securities statutes of any state or
other jurisdiction, (ii) have the status of securities acquired in a
transaction under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and (iii) are
"restricted securities" (as that term is defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the
Securities Act), and, therefore, Seller further acknowledges that the shares
of Buyer Common Stock that Seller is acquiring pursuant to this Agreement
cannot be resold unless they are registered under applicable federal and state
securities laws (including the Securities Act) or unless exemptions from all
such applicable registration requirements are available, and consequently,
Seller must bear the economic risk of investment for an indefinite period of
time. Seller will not sell or otherwise transfer any of the shares of Buyer
Common Stock that Seller may acquire pursuant to this Agreement without either
the prior registration thereof under the Securities Act and all other
applicable statutes, or applicable exemptions from the registration
requirements of each of those statutes.

(e) Legend. Seller understands that certificates or book entries representing
the shares of Buyer Common Stock being issued hereunder will bear the
following legend reflecting the foregoing restrictions on transfer:

"The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or under any
other applicable securities laws. The securities may not be sold, transferred,
assigned or pledged or otherwise disposed of at any time unless (i) they are
registered under the Securities Act and such other applicable laws or (ii) in
the opinion of legal counsel for Plantronics, Inc., Inc. or other legal
opinion reasonably satisfactory to Plantronics, Inc. such disposition will not
result in a violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities
laws or (iii) sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act (provided that the
transferor provides Plantronics, Inc. with reasonable assurances (in the form
of a seller representation letter and, if applicable, a broker representation
letter) that the securities may be sold pursuant to such rule)."

3.8. No Additional Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties expressly made by Buyer in Article 5, Seller acknowledges that none
of Buyer or any other Person makes, and that Seller has not relied upon, any
express or implied representation or warranty whatsoever and specifically (but
without limiting the foregoing), that neither Buyer nor its any of its
representatives makes, nor has Seller relied upon, any representation or
warranty with respect to (a) Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise), prospects or any other matter relating to Buyer or its
Subsidiaries or (b) any documentation, forecasts, budgets, projections,
estimates or other information (including the accuracy or completeness of, or
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying, such documentation,
forecasts, budgets, projections, estimates or other information) provided by
Buyer or any representative of Buyer, including in any "data rooms" or
management presentations.

Delaware. Polycom is duly licensed, qualified or authorized to do business and
is in good standing or equivalent status in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the assets owned or leased by Polycom or the nature of its
business makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified, authorized or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to be material to Polycom. Schedule 4.1 sets forth a
correct and complete list of the jurisdictions in which Polycom is duly
licensed, qualified, or authorized to do business. True, correct and complete
copies of the Organizational Documents of Polycom have been made available to
Buyer. The minute books and stock records of Polycom, which have been made

and has valid title to all of the Shares free and clear of all Liens (other
than any Liens arising pursuant to applicable federal and state securities
Laws, Liens arising as a result of actions solely taken by Buyer or any of its

which is convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having such right);
or (ii) the value of which is in any way based upon or derived from capital
stock or other Equity Interests of Polycom.

4.3. Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary of Polycom is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and (where applicable or recognized) in good standing or
equivalent status under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, except where the failure to be in good standing would not be
material to Polycom and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Each Subsidiary of
Polycom is duly licensed, qualified or authorized to do business and is in
good standing or equivalent status in each jurisdiction in which the character
of the assets owned or leased by such Polycom Subsidiary or the nature of its
business makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified, authorized or in good standing would
reasonably be expected to be not material to Polycom. Schedule 4.3 sets forth
a true and complete list of the holders of the Equity Interests of each
Subsidiary of Polycom. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.3, neither Polycom
nor any Subsidiary of Polycom owns, directly or indirectly, any Equity
Interests in any other Person. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.3, there are

violation of any Law or any charter or other provision regarding preemptive,
anti-dilution or similar rights. There are no outstanding or authorized stock
appreciation, profit participation, phantom stock or similar rights with
respect to any Subsidiary of Polycom. Neither Polycom nor any Subsidiary of
Polycom is party to any voting trust, proxy or other agreement or
understanding with respect to the voting of any Equity Interests of such
Subsidiary of Polycom. Polycom has made available to Buyer a correct and
complete copy of each certificate representing the issued shares of capital
stock or other Equity Interests of its Subsidiaries as of the Agreement Date

instruments to be executed and delivered by it pursuant hereto and to carry
out the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other documents and instruments to be

enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

4.5. No Violation.

(a) Except (i) as set forth in Schedule 4.5(a), or (ii) (other than with
respect to clause (i)) as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, material to Polycom, the execution and delivery by
Polycom of this Agreement or the other documents and instruments to be
executed and delivered by it pursuant hereto, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or compliance by Polycom with any
of the provisions hereof or thereof will not conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, result in the creation of any Lien (other than any Liens arising
pursuant to applicable federal and state securities Laws, Liens arising as a
result of actions solely taken by Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates,
any Polycom Permitted Liens and Liens contemplated by the Financing) under,

Statements") consisting of (i) the consolidated audited financial statements
(including the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations,
stockholders' equity (deficit), comprehensive income (loss) and cash flow) of
Polycom as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015 (the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, the

(A) are prepared from and consistent with such financial statements as have
been prepared and used by the Polycom Companies in the ordinary course of
measuring and reporting the Polycom Companies' operating results, financial
condition and/or cash flow; (B) are prepared in accordance with GAAP, as
applied on a consistent basis, and with the books and records of the Polycom
Companies; provided, however, that the consolidated unaudited financial
statements are subject to normal year-end adjustments (which if made would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Polycom) and to final
adjustments related to the purchase of Obihai Technology, Inc. (which if made
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Polycom) and do
not contain all footnotes required under GAAP, which if presented would not
provide, individually or in the aggregate, additional material information;
and (C) fairly present, in all material respects, the assets, Liabilities,
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Polycom
Companies as of the dates and for the periods indicated. None of Polycom, its

fraud, whether or not material, that involves any of Polycom's or its
Subsidiaries' management or other employees or other Persons who have a role
in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting controls
utilized by Polycom and its Subsidiaries or (ii) any claim or allegation
regarding the foregoing.

(b) Internal Accounting Controls. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.6(b), the

to provide reasonable assurance that, since January 1, 2015, (i) transactions
are executed in accordance with management's general or specific

preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, or any
corresponding provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law, and to maintain asset

disclosed in the Polycom Disclosure Schedule; (iii) Liabilities to perform

Polycom Disclosure Schedule; (iv) Liabilities that are of the type or kind
required to be disclosed in the Polycom Disclosure Schedule but are not

Policy. Since March 31, 2016, no Polycom Company has been refused any
insurance with respect to any aspect of its assets, Liabilities or operations,
except where such refusal would be reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, be not material to Polycom. Since March 31, 2016, no Polycom
Company has received any written notice from or on behalf of any insurance
carrier issuing any Polycom Current Insurance Policy that insurance rates
therefor will hereafter be substantially increased (except to the extent
insurance rates may be increased for all similarly situated risks). Other than
workers compensation insurance policies, no Polycom Insurance Policy (nor any
previous policy) provides for or is subject to any currently enforceable
retroactive rate or other premium adjustment arising wholly or partially out
of any events arising prior to the Closing that would reasonably be expected
to be material to Polycom.

(c) Claims. There is no material claim by any Polycom Company pending under
any Polycom Insurance Policy as to which coverage has been questioned, denied

individually or in the aggregate, material to Polycom.

provided as of the date hereof include only those Contracts with more than
$15,000,000 of revenue; provided, further, that Polycom will be permitted to

(vii) Contracts to guaranty payment or performance in excess of the Threshold
by any Person, to indemnify any director or officer of Polycom except under

business) or to act as a surety, or otherwise be contingently or secondarily
liable for the obligations of any Person in excess of the Threshold;

(viii) Contracts with any Governmental Authority involving payment or
performance in excess of the Threshold;

complete copies of the Contracts to be listed in Schedule 4.20(a), together
with all material amendments.

4.21. No Default. Since March 31, 2016, except for breaches, violations or
defaults that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, be not material to Polycom or its Subsidiaries, no Polycom Company
is in default under any Material Contract, nor, to the Knowledge of Polycom,
has any event or omission occurred that, through the passage of time or the
giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder or cause the
acceleration of any material obligations of such Polycom Company thereunder or
result in the creation of any Lien (other than a Polycom Permitted Lien) on
any of the capital stock or other Equity Interests, or any of the material
assets, Liabilities or operations, of such Polycom Company or the Shares. To
the Knowledge of Polycom, no third party is in default under any Material
Contract, nor, to the Knowledge of Polycom, has any event or omission occurred
that, through the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
constitute a default thereunder, or give rise to an automatic termination or
the right of discretionary termination thereof. Each Material Contract to
which any Polycom Company is a party or otherwise bound is in full force and
effect and is a valid and binding agreement enforceable against such Polycom
Company and, to the Knowledge of Polycom, the other party or parties thereto
in accordance with its terms.

4.22. Labor Matters. Except as has not resulted in, and would not reasonably
be expected to result in, a material liability taken as a whole, no Polycom
Company has breached or otherwise failed to comply with the provisions of any
Collective Bargaining Agreement, and neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or any of the other documents and instruments to be executed
and delivered pursuant hereto nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will, either alone or in combination with any
other event, result in any breach or other violation of any Collective
Bargaining Agreement. Since January 1, 2016, no Polycom Company has
experienced any material labor disputes, any material union organization
attempts or any work stoppages due to labor disagreements. Except for past
violations for which no Polycom Company is subject to any current Liability
and for which no Polycom Company can become subject to any future Liability,
each Polycom Company is and since January 1, 2016 has been in material
compliance with all applicable Laws or Orders relating to employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours,
and no Polycom Company has engaged in any unfair labor practice. There is no

pending or, to the Knowledge of Polycom, threatened against any Polycom
Company. To the Knowledge of Polycom, there is no secondary boycott pending or
threatened with respect to any Products/Services of any Polycom Company. No
question concerning representation relating to the employees of any Polycom
Company is pending or, to the Knowledge of Polycom, threatened. No labor
grievance or any arbitration proceeding arising out of or under any Collective
Bargaining Agreement that is material to the Polycom Business or the Polycom
Companies is pending, to the Knowledge of the Polycom. There are no pending
or, to the Knowledge of Polycom, threatened material administrative charges or
court complaints against any Polycom Company concerning alleged employment
discrimination or other employment-related matters.

material Polycom Plans, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any bonus or

Polycom Plan is under, and neither Polycom nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice with respect to a U.S. Polycom Plan of, an audit or
investigation by the IRS, DOL, PBGC, or any other Governmental Authority; (vi)
no U.S. Polycom Plan provides any employer premium subsidies with respect to

records to enable it to comply with any reporting obligations it may have
under Sections 6055 and 6056 of the Code.

(e) Prohibited Transactions; Fiduciary Duties. Except as would not reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to Polycom and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, no "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any U.S. Polycom
Plan for which a statutory, regulatory, or administrative exemption does not
apply has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur.

(f) Post-Retirement Benefits. None of Polycom or its Subsidiaries has any
material current or projected liability with respect to post-retirement
health, medical or life insurance benefits for any employee, officer,
director, or other independent contractor of Polycom or its Subsidiaries
(whether current, former, or retired), or their beneficiaries or dependents,
except for coverage mandated by COBRA, in connection with severance benefits
or the continuation of coverage through the end of the calendar month in which
termination from employment occurs but in all such cases for no longer than
the applicable COBRA continuation period, and except for other coverage
mandated by applicable Laws.

(g) No Triggering of Obligations. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.23(g),
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
documents and instruments to be executed and delivered pursuant hereto nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will, either
alone or in combination with any other event, (i) entitle any employee,
officer, director, or other independent contractor of Polycom or its
Subsidiaries (whether current, former, or retired) or their beneficiaries or
dependents to material severance pay under a Polycom Plan; (ii) result in any

each case to the extent material and applicable, the Non-U.S. Polycom Plan
document, all material amendments thereto and all related trust documents, the
most recent plan summary and all amendments thereto, the most recent actuarial
valuation report, the most recent Tax return filing. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to Polycom and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each Non-U.S. Polycom Plan (i) if intended to
qualify for special tax treatment, meets all the requirements for such
treatment, and no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to

Buyer in Polycom's electronic data room is correct and complete as of March

4.25. Intellectual Property Rights.

(a) Generally. Schedule 4.25(a) sets forth a complete and correct list of: (i)
all Polycom Registered Intellectual Property Rights, including the name of the
current owner, registrant or applicant, the jurisdictions by or in which any
such registrations or applications have been issued or filed, the respective
registration or application numbers and dates of issuance, registrations or
filing; (ii) all material unregistered trademarks owned by any Polycom
Company, including the name of the current owner; (iii) all material Polycom
Inbound License Agreements (other than shrink-wrap, click-wrap, and similar
non-exclusive licenses for commercially available off-the-shelf Software
generally commercially available on standard and non-discriminatory terms);
and (iv) all Internet Assets owned by any Polycom Company. Except for the
Polycom Permitted Liens and except as set forth on Schedule 4.25(a), no third
party owns or has any rights with respect to Polycom Owned Intellectual
Property Rights.

(b) Ownership. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.25(b), (i) each Polycom
Company either exclusively owns, free and clear of any Liens (except for the
Polycom Permitted Liens) or has a valid and enforceable written license or
other right or license to use the Polycom Business Intellectual Property
Rights, free and clear of all Liens, and, to Polycom's Knowledge, no
Litigation by any third party contesting the validity, enforceability, use or
ownership of any of the foregoing has been initiated, is currently pending, or
is threatened, except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, material to Polycom and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) all of
the rights of each Polycom Company in and to the Polycom Business Intellectual
Property Rights (excluding Polycom Licensed Intellectual Property Rights) are
freely assignable (subject to the Polycom Permitted Liens) by each Polycom
Company, including the right to create derivative works. Each present or past
employee, officer, director, consultant or any other Person who has developed
any material Polycom Owned Intellectual Property Rights (including any
Software) for any Polycom Company has executed a valid and enforceable
Contract with a Polycom Company that conveys to one or more Polycom Companies
any and all right, title and interest in and to all such Intellectual Property
Rights developed by such Person in connection with such Person's employment or
engagement by a Polycom Company, and which Contract, in the case of any
Polycom Company that is a Chinese entity, does not require any future payments
under the Contract or by Law for the applicable Polycom Company Chinese entity
to own all right, title, and interest in and to all such Intellectual Property
Rights.

(c) Infringement. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.25(c), (i) no Polycom
Company has received notice of any infringement, violation, dilution or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right owned by any third Person,
including any written demand, request, or unsolicited offer that any Polycom
Company license rights from a third Person, (ii) no Polycom Company is
infringing, diluting, misappropriating, or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by any third Person, and (iii) no Polycom
Company has infringed, diluted, misappropriated or otherwise violated any
Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person or holder of Equity Interests
of any Polycom Company that would be material to the Polycom Companies taken
as a whole.

(d) Intellectual Property Rights Contracts. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.25(d), there are no material Contracts to which any Polycom Company is a
party pursuant to which any Polycom Company has (i) transferred ownership of
any Polycom Business Intellectual Property Right owned by such Polycom Company
or granted any license or option to any other Person (other than another
Polycom Company) with respect to such Polycom Business Intellectual Property
Rights owned by such Polycom Company outside the ordinary course of Polycom
Business consistent with past practices or (ii) obtained a license under or
option to acquire or license the Intellectual Property Rights of another
Person (other than licenses for commercially available "off-the-shelf," non-
custom Software, non-disclosure agreements entered into in the ordinary course
of Polycom Business consistent with past practice, licenses for "open source
software" or "public software" or under a similar licensing or distribution
model, and non-exclusive inbound trademark licenses that are entered into in
the ordinary course of Polycom Business consistent with past practice) (the
Contracts required to be listed on Schedule 4.25(d), the "Polycom Intellectual
Property Rights Contracts").

(e) Open Source Material. To Polycom's Knowledge, The Polycom Companies are in
material compliance with the terms and conditions of all licenses for any Open
Source Material used by the Polycom Companies. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.25(e), the Polycom Companies have not used Open Source Material in such a
way (i) that would require, as a condition of use, modification or
distribution of such Open Source Material, or (ii) that any Polycom Software
be (x) disclosed or distributed in source code form, (y) be licensed for the
purpose of making derivative works, or (z) be redistributable at no charge.

(f) Source Code. The Polycom Companies possess all source code and other
documentation and materials reasonably necessary to compile and operate the
material Software owned by the Polycom Companies ("Polycom Company Software"),
except where the failure to possess all source code and other documentation
and materials reasonably necessary to compile and operate the Polycom Company
Software would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the
Polycom Companies. The Polycom Companies have validly and effectively obtained
the right and license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the third-party
programming and materials ("Third Party Software") contained in or combined
with the Polycom Company Software. Standard back-up copies and working copies
of the source code for the Polycom Company Software and Third Party Software
(to the extent held by any Polycom Company) have been made and are securely
maintained. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.25(f), no Polycom Company is
bound by or is a party to any Contract pursuant to which (i) such Polycom
Company is obligated to provide to any third Person any proprietary source
code owned by any Polycom Company Software or (ii) such Polycom Company has
deposited, or is or may be required to deposit, with an escrow agent or other
party, any such source code. To Polycom's Knowledge, no circumstance or
condition currently exists that, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both, will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the delivery or
disclosure of any such source code to any third Person who is not, as of the
Agreement Date, an employee of any Polycom Company. To Polycom's Knowledge,
there are not, and for the past three (3) years have not been, any defects,
technical concerns or problems in any of the Polycom Company Software or Third
Party Software that would prevent any Polycom Company Software from performing
substantially in accordance with its user specifications or functionality
descriptions.

(g) Restrictions. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.25(g), there are no
settlements, injunctions, forbearances to sue, consents, coexistence
agreements, judgments, or Orders or similar obligations to which any Polycom
Company is party or is otherwise bound that (i) restrict the rights of such
Polycom Company to use any Polycom Business Intellectual Property Rights
(excluding Polycom Licensed Intellectual Property Rights) or (ii) permit third
parties to use any Polycom Business Intellectual Property Rights (excluding
Polycom Licensed Intellectual Property Rights) in a manner that would
otherwise infringe any Polycom Business Intellectual Property Rights
(excluding Polycom Licensed Intellectual Property Rights).

(h) Registrations. All registrations for Polycom Registered Intellectual
Property Rights are valid, subsisting and in force, and any applications to
register any unregistered Intellectual Property Rights identified Schedule
4.25(a) are pending and in good standing, all without third party challenge of
any kind except for examination proceedings from the appropriate Governmental
Authority such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office or such other
intellectual property office in the applicable geographic region ("Patent and
Trademark Office"), and each Polycom Company has the right to bring actions
for infringement or unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property Rights owned
by such Polycom Company.

(i) Patents and Trademarks. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.25(i), all
patents and trademarks included in the Polycom Registered Intellectual
Property Rights have been maintained and renewed in accordance with all
applicable Laws. Except for trademarks that are not currently being used, such
as intent-to-use, abandoned, cancelled, and expired trademark registrations
and applications, all trademarks are in use in the form appearing in, and in
connection with the goods and services listed in, their respective
registration certificates (with respect to registered trademarks) or
applications (with respect to unregistered trademarks for which an application
has been filed). Each Polycom Company has used commercially reasonable efforts
to protect its rights in such patents and registered and material unregistered
trademarks, and to Polycom's Knowledge there have been no acts or omissions by
any Polycom Company the result of which would be to materially adversely
affect the rights of any Polycom Company to apply for or enforce appropriate
legal protection of such patents and registered and material unregistered
trademarks.

(j) Protective Measures. Each Polycom Company has taken reasonable measures to
(i) safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of the Trade
Secrets that are part of the Intellectual Property Rights owned by such
Polycom Company or that such Polycom Company is otherwise bound by contract to
safeguard and maintain and (ii) protect the confidentiality of all
Confidential Information owned by such Polycom Company, including in each case
requiring all employees, independent contractors and temporary contingent
workers of any Polycom Company or any third Person having access thereto to
agree to be bound by written confidentiality obligations. To Polycom's
Knowledge, there has been no material disclosure of any such Trade Secrets by
any employee, independent contractors or temporary contingent workers of any
Polycom Company bound by such confidentiality obligations to any third Person
who was not bound by a confidentiality obligation owed to a Polycom Company.
To Polycom's Knowledge, no Confidential Information of any Polycom Company has
been disclosed by any employee, independent contractors or temporary
contingent workers of the Polycom Company bound by such confidentiality and
non-disclosure obligations to any third Person who was not bound by a
confidentiality and non-disclosure obligation owed to a Polycom Company; and,
to Polycom's Knowledge, no third Person that is a party to any confidentiality
and non-disclosure agreement with any Polycom Company is in breach of default
thereof. To Polycom's Knowledge, no third Person is misappropriating,
infringing, diluting, or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property Rights
of any Polycom Company.

(k) Software. Polycom has used diligent efforts to avoid any defect, virus or
programming, design or documentation error from being introduced into, or
otherwise compromising, Polycom Company Software. To Polycom's Knowledge, none
of the Polycom Company Software, when delivered, contains any undocumented
self-help mechanism, virus, Trojan horse, "back door," "time bomb," worm or
other Software routine or hardware component designed to permit unauthorized
access or designed to disable a computer program automatically with the
passage of time or under the positive control of a Person other than an
authorized licensee or owner of the Software program. Polycom has used
diligent efforts to avoid including "spyware" or "trackware" (as such terms
are commonly understood in the software industry) in the Polycom Company
Software. None of the Polycom Company Software (i) records a user's actions
without such user's knowledge or (ii) employs a user's Internet connection
without such user's knowledge to gather or transmit information on such user
or such user's behavior.

(l) Polycom Websites. For each web site owned and controlled by any Polycom
Company ("Polycom Web Sites"), the applicable Polycom Company has provided and
does provide a privacy policy posted on each such web site that materially
complies with all applicable Laws, copies of which have been provided to Buyer
("Polycom Privacy Policies").

(m) Personal Information and User Data. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to Polycom and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each Polycom Company has at all times since
March 1, 2015 complied with and currently complies with (i) any Contracts to
which such Polycom Company is a party relating to privacy, data protection and
the collection, compilation, sharing, use, processing, storage, transfer or
security from unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information
("Personal Information"), (ii) Polycom Privacy Policies, (iii) all consents
and authorizations that apply to such Polycom Company's receipt, access, use
and disclosure of Personal Information (as defined below) and for which such
Polycom Company has been provided a copy or otherwise made aware of the
requirements of the consent or authorization, and (iv) all applicable Laws
relating to privacy, data protection, sales and marketing, and the collection,
compilation, sharing, use, processing, storage, transfer or security from
unauthorized disclosure of Personal Information or User Data collected, used
or held for use by such Polycom Company. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Personal Information includes any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person; and provided further that an
identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
identification number, location data, or an online identifier. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to Polycom and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Polycom Companies
contractually require all third parties, including vendors, Affiliates, and
other persons providing services to any Polycom Company that have access to or
receive Personal Information from or on behalf of any Polycom Company to
comply with all applicable Laws and to take all reasonable steps to ensure
that all Polycom Personal Information in such third parties' possession or
control is protected against damage, loss, and against unauthorized access,
acquisition, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse. Except for
disclosures of Personal Information or User Data required by Law, authorized
by the provider of the Personal Information or User Data or in accordance with
the applicable Contract, no Polycom Company sells, rents or otherwise makes
available to third parties any such Personal Information in violation of any
applicable Laws. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.25(m), and to the Knowledge
of Polycom, there have been no material breaches of security leading to the
accidental or unlawful loss or unauthorized disclosure of or access to any
Personal Information or User Data held or collected by any Polycom Company
("Breach of Security"). There is no, and never has been, any material
Litigation pending or, to Polycom's Knowledge, threatened against any Polycom
Company alleging a Breach of Security, violation of any Person's privacy, data
protection or data rights or Laws concerning privacy, data protection or data
security, or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. No Polycom

is and has been in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of
the Code and all applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance promulgated
thereunder.

5.23. Intellectual Property Rights.

(a) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.23(a) or as would reasonably be expected
to be not material to Buyer: (i) the conduct of the Buyer Business as
currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise

(b) To Buyer's Knowledge, the Buyer Companies are in material compliance with

the Buyer Companies. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.23(b), the Buyer
Companies have not used Open Source Material in such a way (i) that would

them responsible for the payment of any broker's, finder's, or similar fees.

5.25. Sufficient Funds.

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller a complete and correct copy of (i) an
executed debt commitment letter (such commitment letter, including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and amendments thereto, the "Debt
Commitment Letter") and (ii) and executed fee letter related thereto (the "Fee
Letter") (provided that provisions in the Fee Letter may be redacted in a
customary manner), in each case, dated the date hereof, issued to Buyer by
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (such
Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter, as each may be amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced from time to time to the extent permitted or required
by Section 6.5, the "Debt Financing Commitment") in connection with the debt
financing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Debt Financing"),
pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to the
terms thereof, to lend amounts set forth therein, which, taken together with
the cash on hand of Buyer, is in no event less than the Cash Consideration
Amount, plus, without duplication, any amounts required to be paid by Buyer or
its Affiliates pursuant to the Fee Letter (as defined below) and fees and
expenses related to the transactions contemplated hereby and required to be
paid by Buyer or its Affiliates) (such amount together with the Cash
Consideration Amount, the "Required Amount"). Buyer acknowledges that Buyer's
performance of its obligations under this Agreement is not contingent upon the
availability of financing to Buyer.

(b) The Debt Financing Commitment is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer, and to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, in each case,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or any other similar Law affecting
creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). As
of the date of this Agreement, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of the Debt Financing Commitment by the parties thereto (other than
Buyer), the Debt Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and, to
Buyer's Knowledge, has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such amendment or
modification is currently contemplated. Buyer is not in breach of any of the
terms or conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment in any material
respects and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a material breach,
material default or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth
therein. As of the date of this Agreement (and assuming that Seller, the
Polycom Companies and their respective Affiliates and representatives provide
the cooperation and assistance required by this Agreement and satisfy the
conditions set forth in Article VIII) and based on facts and events known by
Buyer as of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has no reason to believe that
any of the conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment will not be satisfied
on a timely basis, or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be
made available to it on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer has not received notice that the lenders party
thereto intend to terminate any portion of the Debt Financing Commitment or
not to provide any of the Debt Financing. The net proceeds from the Financing,
together with cash on hand, will be sufficient for Buyer to pay the Required
Amount. Buyer, or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, as applicable, has paid in
full any and all commitment or other fees required by the Debt Financing
Commitment that are due as of the date of this Agreement and will pay (or
cause to be paid), after the date of this Agreement, all other such fees
thereunder as they become due. Except for the Fee Letter, there are no side
letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the
Debt Financing to which Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates is a party.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than those set forth in
this Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitments or the payment of fees
payable pursuant to the fee letters with respect to the Debt Financing
Commitment (collectively, the "Disclosed Conditions"). No Person has any right
to impose, and none of Buyer or any counterparty to any Debt Financing
Commitment has any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to such
funding, other than the Disclosed Conditions, any reduction to the aggregate
amount available under the Debt Financing Commitments on the Closing Date, or
any term or condition that would have the effect of reducing the aggregate
amount available under the Debt Financing Commitments on the Closing Date.

5.26. Solvency. Buyer is not entering into this Agreement or any Financing
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors
of Buyer or its affiliates. Immediately after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated herein and in any Financing, including without
limitation any Financing and the making of the payments contemplated by this
Agreement and assuming satisfaction of the conditions to Buyer's obligation to
consummate the transactions as set forth herein, the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Seller and Polycom set forth herein and the
performance by the Parties of their obligations hereunder in all material
respects, Buyer and the Buyer Companies will be Solvent at and immediately
after the Closing.

5.27. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(a) Buyer has filed with or furnished to the SEC all required Buyer SEC
Reports since March 31, 2016.

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Buyer SEC Report complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as

(d) Buyer has heretofore furnished or made available to the Seller complete
and correct copies of all comment letters from the SEC since December 31, 2015
through the Agreement Date with respect to any of the Buyer SEC Reports,

comment letters and written responses are not publicly available on EDGAR. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any of the
Buyer SEC Reports, and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, none of the Buyer SEC
Reports are subject to ongoing SEC review.

(e) Buyer has established and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
("Internal Controls"). The management of Buyer has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of its system of internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to Buyer's outside auditors and
the audit committee of the board of directors of Buyer (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of its
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any
material respect Buyer's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Buyer's
internal control over financial reporting.

(f) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
Buyer (or each former principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of Buyer, as applicable) have made all certifications required by Rule
13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications are
complete and correct in all material respects.

(g) Since the date of the Buyer Recent Balance Sheet, there has been no
transaction, or series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or
understandings, nor is there any proposed transaction as of the date of this
Agreement, or series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or
understandings to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries was or is to be a
party, that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act that has not been disclosed in the Buyer
SEC Reports publicly filed or furnished with the SEC following the date of the
Buyer Recent Balance Sheet.

5.28. Investment Representations.

(a) Offering Exemption. Buyer understands that the shares of Polycom Common
Stock to be acquired by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement have not been
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or qualified under any state
securities Laws and that such shares of Polycom Common Stock are being offered
and sold pursuant to an exemption from such registration and qualification
based in part upon the representations contained herein. Buyer is an
"accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) under the U.S.
Securities Act.

(b) Knowledge and Experience; Ability to Bear Risks. Buyer has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that Buyer is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the investment contemplated by this
Agreement; and Buyer is able to bear the economic risk of this investment in
the shares of Polycom Common Stock that may be delivered to Buyer or held in
escrow pursuant to this Agreement (including a complete loss of Buyer's
investment or a reduction in the price of Polycom Common Stock).

(c) Investment Purpose. Buyer is acquiring the shares of Polycom Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement solely for Buyer's own account for investment and
not with a view toward the resale or distribution thereof, nor with any
present intention of transferring or distributing Buyer's interest in such
shares of Polycom Common Stock, in each case in a manner that would require
registration of such shares of Polycom Common Stock. Buyer has no contract,
undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer,
assign or pledge to such person or anyone else all or any part of the shares
of Polycom Common Stock being acquired under this Agreement, and Buyer has no
current plans or intentions to enter into any such contract, undertaking or
arrangement, in each case in a manner that would require registration of such
shares of Polycom Common Stock.

(d) Resale Restrictions. Buyer acknowledges that the shares of Polycom Common
Stock that Buyer may acquire pursuant to this Agreement (i) have not been
registered under the Securities Act or the securities statutes of any state or
other jurisdiction, (ii) have the status of securities acquired in a
transaction under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and (iii) are
"restricted securities" (as that term is defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the
Securities Act), and, therefore, Buyer further acknowledges that the shares of
Polycom Common Stock that Buyer is acquiring pursuant to this Agreement cannot
be resold unless they are registered under applicable federal and state
securities laws (including the Securities Act) or unless exemptions from all
such applicable registration requirements are available, and consequently,
Buyer must bear the economic risk of investment for an indefinite period of
time. Buyer will not sell or otherwise transfer any of the shares of Polycom
Common Stock that Buyer may acquire pursuant to this Agreement without either
the prior registration thereof under the Securities Act and all other
applicable statutes, or applicable exemptions from the registration
requirements of each of those statutes.

(e) Legend. Buyer understands that certificates or book entries representing
the shares of Polycom Common Stock being issued hereunder will bear the
following legend reflecting the foregoing restrictions on transfer:

"The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or under any
other applicable securities laws. The securities may not be sold, transferred,
assigned or pledged or otherwise disposed of at any time unless (i) they are
registered under the Securities Act and such other applicable laws or (ii) in
the opinion of legal counsel for Polycom, Inc. or other legal opinion
reasonably satisfactory to Polycom, Inc. such disposition will not result in a
violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws or
(iii) sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act (provided that the transferor
provides Polycom, Inc. with reasonable assurances (in the form of a seller
representation letter and, if applicable, a broker representation letter) that
the securities may be sold pursuant to such rule)."

5.29. No Additional Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties expressly made by Seller in Article 3 and Polycom in Article 4,
Buyer acknowledges that neither Polycom, Seller nor any other Person makes,
and that Buyer has not relied upon, any express or implied representation or
warranty whatsoever and specifically (but without limiting the foregoing),
that neither Polycom, Seller nor either of their representatives makes, nor
has Buyer relied upon, any representation or warranty with respect to (a)
Polycom, Seller or their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise), prospects or any other matter relating to Polycom, Seller or their
respective Subsidiaries or (b) any documentation, forecasts, budgets,
projections, estimates or other information (including the accuracy or
completeness of, or the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying, such
documentation, forecasts, budgets, projections, estimates or other
information) provided by Polycom, Seller or either of their representatives,
including in any "data rooms" or management presentations.

extent that: (i) any applicable Law requires a Party to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information; (ii) access to such
documents or information would waive any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or
information or would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any

dealings with the Polycom Companies, in each case, that are material to the
Polycom Business;

(the "Waived 280G Benefits"), and (y) solicit the approval of the stockholder
of Polycom in a manner intended to comply with Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and

date hereof. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that in the event stockholder approval of the Waived 280G

(r) Except as set forth in Section 6.14, no Polycom Company nor Seller shall,

(ii) prior to the Effective Time, each of Polycom and Buyer shall exercise,

the foregoing, as applicable, not to, directly or indirectly (other than with

6.5. Further Actions.

(a) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all
action and to do, or cause to be done, and to cooperate fully with the other
Parties with respect to, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including
using their reasonable best efforts to obtain, transfer or renew prior to the
Closing all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and parties to Contracts
with any Polycom Company that are necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that neither Party shall be
required to pay any fees to such parties to Contracts in connection with the
Parties' efforts to obtain such consents. With regard to consents from, and
notices to, third parties to the Contracts set forth in Schedule 4.20 and from
the Polycom Material Customers and Polycom Material Suppliers, Polycom and/or
Seller shall initiate contact to obtain such consents, or to provide such
notices, only in conjunction and cooperation with Buyer.

(b) Subject to the final sentence of this Section 6.5(b), Polycom and Seller
shall, and shall cause the Polycom Companies to, use its and their
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Polycom
and Seller shall, and shall cause the Polycom Companies to, in each case
subject to the final sentence of this Section 6.5(b):

(i) as promptly as reasonably practicable provide customary financial or other
pertinent information relating to the Polycom Companies as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer or the Financing Sources, including information to be used
in the preparation of a customary information package regarding the business
and operations of the Polycom Companies as is reasonably necessary for the
completion of the Debt Financing, and otherwise provide customary
authorization letters and enter into customary definitive financing documents
and take other actions that are customary in connection with the Debt
Financing of this type (including, to the extent requested within nine (9)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing all documentation and other
information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-
your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations);

(ii) reasonably cooperate with the marketing and syndication efforts of Buyer,
its Affiliates and the Financing Sources, including participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, due diligence sessions and road shows, at times
and at locations reasonably acceptable to the Polycom Companies;

(iii) (A) provide reasonable and customary assistance in preparing customary
offering memoranda, rating agency presentations, lender presentations and
other similar reasonably customary documents, (B) make available on a
customary and reasonable basis and upon reasonable notice, appropriate
personnel (including using commercially reasonable efforts to make available
auditors of the Polycom Companies), as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or
any Financing Source, and (C) obtain customary financing accountants' comfort
letters and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials
relating to any Financing and in connection with any filings required to be
made by Buyer and/or its Affiliates pursuant to the U.S. Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (including any registration statement);

(iv) provide such information as may be necessary so that the customary
marketing materials delivered to the Financing Sources or any prospective
lender, solely as they relate to matters with respect to the Polycom Companies
and their Affiliates prior to the Closing Date:

(A) with respect to all written information and written data (other than the
Projections, as defined below, estimates, budgets and other forward-looking
information and information of a general economic or industry specific nature)
concerning the Polycom Companies and their Affiliates and the transactions
contemplated hereby that has been or will be made available to the Financing
Sources or the prospective lenders by Polycom Companies and their respective
representatives, subsidiaries or Affiliates (or on their behalf) (the
"Information"), when taken as a whole after giving effect to all supplements
and updates provided thereto prior to the Closing Date, (x) is, and in the
case of Information made available after the date hereof, will (when taken as
a whole) when furnished be complete and correct in all material respects and
(y) does not, and in the case of Information made available after the date
hereof, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading in any material respect; and

(B) with respect to all financial projections concerning the Polycom Companies
and their Affiliates, that such information take into account the consummation
of the Transactions, that have been or will be made available to the Financing
Sources or the prospective Lenders by Polycom Companies and their respective
representatives, Subsidiaries or Affiliates (or on behalf of the Polycom
Companies and their respective representatives, Subsidiaries and Affiliates)
(the "Projections") have been and will be prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed by the Polycom Companies and their Affiliates be
reasonable at the time such Projections are made available to the Financing
Sources or the prospective lenders by Polycom Companies and their Affiliates,
it being understood that such Projections are not to be viewed as facts,
actual results may vary materially from the Projections, there can be no
assurance that the results therein will be realized and such Projections are
subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are
beyond the control of the Polycom Companies and their subsidiaries. Polycom
agrees that if, at any time prior to the later of the Closing Date and the
Syndication Date (under and as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter), it
becomes aware that any of the representations and warranties contained in the
preceding sentence would be incorrect in any material respect if the
Information and Projections were being furnished, and such representations
were being made, at such time, then Polycom will use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly supplement the Information and the Projections so that
such representations are (or with respect to Information and Projections
relating to the Polycom Companies, to Polycom's knowledge are) correct in all
material respects under those circumstances.;

(v) use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and its Affiliates in
providing that the syndication efforts relating to any Debt Financing benefit
from the existing banking relationships of the Polycom Companies; and

(vi) execute and deliver any pledge and security documents, other definitive
financing documents, or other certificates or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer and otherwise facilitating the pledging of, and granting,
recording and perfection of security interests in, collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (I) nothing herein shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would (A) interfere unreasonably in any material
respect with the business or operations of Seller or the Polycom Companies or
any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) require Seller or
the Polycom Companies to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under the Organizational Documents
of Seller, any applicable laws or any Contract that will remain in effect
after the Closing, (II) neither Seller nor any of the Polycom Companies shall
be required to commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the
Closing or that would be effective at or prior to the Effective Time, (III)
none of the Polycom Companies' board of directors (or equivalent bodies) shall
be required to approve or adopt any Debt Financing or agreements related
thereto (or any Alternative Debt Financing) to take effect at or prior to the
Effective Time, (IV) neither Polycom nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to execute or deliver any agreements, certificates or instruments in
connection with any Debt Financing (or any Alternative Debt Financing) to take
effect at or prior to the Effective Time (other than, in the case of this
clause and clause (II), customary authorization letters), (V) none of Seller
or any of the Polycom Companies shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or make any other payment or incur any other liability or
provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time, (VI) in no
event shall Seller, the Polycom Companies or their respective Affiliates and
Subsidiaries be in breach of this Agreement because of the failure of any
financial or other information to be delivered that is not currently readily
available to the Polycom Companies on the date hereof or is not otherwise
prepared in the ordinary course of business of the Polycom Companies at the
time requested by Buyer; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Polycom Companies shall provide to Buyer the financial statements and/or other
information required to be delivered pursuant to Sections 7(b) and (c) of the
Debt Commitment Letter and (VII) neither Seller nor any of the Polycom
Companies shall be responsible for any adjustments to any pro forma financial
information required to be provided in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter.

(c) Polycom and Seller consent to the use of any logos, trademarks and trade
names related to the Polycom Companies in connection with the Financing;
provided, however, that such logos, trademarks and trade names are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm, disparage
or otherwise adversely affect Seller or the Polycom Companies or the
reputation or goodwill of Seller or the Polycom Companies and its or their
marks.

(d) Polycom and Seller shall cause each Polycom Company to execute and deliver
such documents, and take such actions, as may be reasonably necessary or
reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate the consummation of each Lien
Release Transaction; provided however, that neither Seller nor any of the
Polycom Companies shall be required to commit to take any action that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective at or prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless, and to the
extent, Buyer has then sufficient cash available from other sources to pay the
Required Amount, Buyer will, and will cause each of its controlled Affiliates
to, use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on
a timely basis on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment (including, as necessary any flex provisions therein or in any Fee
Letter), including using its reasonable best efforts to:

(i) comply with its obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment in all
material respects;

(ii) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment;

(iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on a timely basis on terms and conditions (including, as necessary,
any such flex provisions) contained therein or otherwise not materially less
favorable to Buyer in the aggregate than those contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment;

(iv) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Buyer contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (or any
definitive agreements related to any Debt Financing), including the payment of
any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to any
part of the Debt Financing; and

(v) upon satisfaction of such conditions, and the conditions set forth in
Article 8 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), enforce all of its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment (or
any definitive agreements related thereto) and consummate the Debt Financing
at or prior to the Closing Date, but in no event later than the Termination
Date.

Buyer will keep Seller informed on a reasonably prompt basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Buyer will
notify Seller promptly in writing, and in any event within three Business Days
(x) of any material breach or material default by Buyer under the Debt
Financing Commitment or definitive agreement related thereto (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach, material
threatened breach or material default) (excluding any such breach or default
that occurs after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and does not relate to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) or any termination or threatened in writing termination by Buyer of
the Debt Financing Commitment or definitive agreement related thereto
(excluding any such termination that occurs after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); or (y) upon having knowledge of
any material breach, material threatened breach or material default by any
other party to the Debt Financing Commitment or definitive agreement related
thereto (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach
or material default) (excluding any such breach or default that occurs after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and does
not relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or any
termination or threatened in writing termination by any other party to the
Debt Financing Commitment or definitive agreement related thereto (excluding
any such termination that occurs after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Other than as set forth in this Section
6.5(e), Buyer will not, without the prior written consent of Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless, and
to the extent, Buyer then has sufficient immediately available cash available
from other sources available to deliver the Required Amount, (A) amend,
modify, supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding
contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreements
related thereto) or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Debt
Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreements related thereto), in each
case to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of (I) adversely affecting in any
material respect the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (II) materially delaying the Closing, (III)
reducing the aggregate cash amount of the funding commitments thereunder below
the Required Amount or (IV) adversely impacting the ability of Buyer to
enforce its rights under any Debt Financing Commitment or (B) consent to early
termination of any Debt Financing Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, Buyer may (without obtaining Seller's consent)
amend, supplement or modify the Debt Financing Commitment (i) to add or
replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the
aggregate, would not prevent, delay or impair the availability of the Debt
Financing under the Debt Financing Commitment or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in any material respect or (ii) in any manner
that is not prohibited by this Agreement. Upon any such amendment, supplement,
waiver or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this
Section 6.5(e), Buyer shall provide a copy thereof to Seller (provided that
provisions in any fee letter may be redacted in a customary manner) and
references to "Debt Financing Commitment" shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended, supplemented, waived or modified under this Section
6.5(e) and references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment as permitted to be amended,
supplemented, waived or modified under this Section 6.5(e). If all conditions
applicable to the Debt Financing Commitments have been satisfied and all of
the conditions set forth in Article 8 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied (or waived),
unless, and to the extent, Buyer has then sufficient immediately available
cash available from other sources available to deliver the Required Amount,
Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to cause the sources of financing under
the Debt Financing Commitment to fund the Debt Financing (including by taking
enforcement action to cause such sources of financing to fund the Financing).

(f) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in a Debt Financing Commitment or a
definitive agreement with respect to the Debt Financing, Buyer will use
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange to
promptly obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from
alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to any portion of the
Debt Financing that is available and other available cash, to pay in cash the
Required Amount on terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Buyer than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (or, if such
terms and conditions are not then available after the use of reasonable best
efforts to obtain such terms and conditions, then on other terms that are
reasonably acceptable to Buyer) ("Alternative Debt Financing") and (ii) obtain
a new financing commitment letter (the "Alternative Debt Commitment Letter")
and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto that provides for
financing in an amount that is sufficient, when added to any portion of the
Debt Financing that is available, and other available cash to pay in cash the
Required Amount. In such event, the term "Debt Financing Commitment" and "Debt
Financing", in each case, as used in this Agreement will be deemed to include
any Alternative Debt Commitment Letter and Alternative Debt Financing,
respectively.

(g) Except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that none of Seller, the Polycom Companies nor any of their respective
representatives will have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to
any Person under or in connection with, the arrangement of the Debt Financing
or any Alternative Debt Financing that Buyer may raise or attempt to raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and that Buyer will
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, Polycom and their respective
representatives, Affiliates and Subsidiaries from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financing
or any Alternative Debt Financing (including any action taken pursuant to
Section 6.5(b)) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than historical information provided by Seller or Polycom expressly for use in
connection therewith) except to the extent that such loss, damage, claim,
cost, expense, interest, award, judgment or penalty arises from Seller\'s, any
Polycom Company\'s or any of their respective representative\'s, Subsidiary\'s
or Affiliate\'s fraud or willful misconduct as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable judicial
determination. Buyer will, and will cause its Affiliates to, reimburse Seller,
Polycom and their respective representatives upon request of Seller and/or
Polycom accompanied by a responsible detailed invoice for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by such Persons in
connection with cooperation provided for in this Section 6.5.

freedom of action with respect to the Polycom Companies, Buyer's ability to
retain any of the Polycom Business, product lines or assets of the Polycom
Companies or Buyer's ability to receive the full benefits of this Agreement.

or any of its Affiliates become subject to, or consent or agree to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order where the
consummation or effectiveness of such requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or Order is not conditioned upon the Closing or would be binding on
Buyer or its Affiliates in the event that the Closing does not occur.

percent (50%) of any discounts (excluding any decrease due to marking to
market) received from Macquarie Bank Limited and Goldman Sachs Bank USA in
connection with such termination, unwinding and discharge.

6.11. Notification.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Polycom shall promptly provide Buyer
(after Polycom or Seller has notice thereof) with written notice of, and keep
Buyer advised as to, (i) any material adverse change in the conduct, financial
condition, assets, Liabilities or operations of the Polycom Companies; (ii)
any pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened Litigation that
challenges the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) any fact,
circumstance, event or action that has resulted in or would reasonably be
expected to result in a material inaccuracy to any representation or warranty
by Seller or Polycom; provided, however, that Buyer's receipt of information
pursuant to this Section 6.11(a) shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by Seller or
Polycom in this Agreement (including Section 10.1 and Section 12.2(a)) and
shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Polycom Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall promptly provide Seller (after Buyer has
notice thereof) with written notice of, and keep Seller advised as to, (i) any
material adverse change in the conduct, financial condition, assets,
Liabilities or operations of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries; (ii) any pending
or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened Litigation that challenges the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) any fact, circumstance, event or
action that has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a
material inaccuracy to any representation or warranty by Buyer; provided,
however, that Seller's receipt of information pursuant to this Section 6.11(b)
shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty
or agreement given or made by Buyer in this Agreement (including Section 10.2
and Section 12.2(b)) and shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule.

6.12. Tail Coverage. Prior to the Closing, Polycom shall, and Seller shall
cause Polycom and the Polycom Companies to, purchase an extended reporting
period endorsement or "tail" under each of their respective existing cyber
liability, professional liability, directors' and officers' liability,
employment practices liability, fiduciary liability and any other claims-made
liability insurance policies (the "Tail Coverage") to provide the Polycom
Companies, and all individuals afforded coverage under each such policy prior
to the Closing, with Tail Coverage for a period of no less than six (6) years
after the Closing for acts or omissions of the Polycom Companies and such
individuals occurring prior to Closing. Buyer shall not, and shall, after the
Closing, cause the Polycom Companies not to, take any action that results in
the cancellation or termination of, or amend or otherwise modify, the Tail
Coverage. Buyer and Seller shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of all costs of
the Tail Coverage. After the Closing for a period of six (6) years, Buyer and
the Polycom Companies shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the certificates of
incorporation and by-laws or similar Organizational Documents of the Polycom
Companies and any indemnification agreements of any Polycom Company with any
of their respective directors, officers or employees, in each case as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would materially and
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the time of
the Closing were current or former directors, officers or employees of a
Polycom Company.

6.13. Company Accounting. Prior to the Closing, Polycom shall, at its sole
expense (but with reasonable cooperation and assistance of Buyer), undertake
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Polycom Companies are able
to account for revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the
Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606), as amended.

6.14. LandR Matters. Prior to the Closing, Polycom and Seller shall, and shall
cause the Polycom Companies to, promptly inform Buyer of all material
communications with a third party (that is not an Affiliate or an agent,
advisor or other representative of Polycom, Seller or their Affiliate) with
respect to the LandR Matters, including with regard to any proposed settlement
or resolution of a LandR Matter and any terms, conditions, or other obligations
related to any proposed settlement or resolution of the LandR Matters. Polycom
and Seller shall not, and Polycom and Seller shall ensure that the Polycom
Companies do not, agree to any settlement or resolution of the LandR Matters
without Buyer's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, except that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Buyer may withhold its consent to the extent that the
aggregate fines, disgorgement and penalties are greater than the Special
Threshold or such settlement requires any Polycom Company to admit to any
violation of federal criminal law. Polycom and Seller shall and shall cause
the Polycom Companies to use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
the fines and penalties with respect to the LandR Matters via declination of
criminal prosecution with respect to any Polycom Company.

6.15. Certain Plan Matters.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Polycom Companies to (i)
amend each U.S. Polycom Plan that is a health or welfare benefit plan that
includes provisions that reference the potential eligibility of retirees for
coverage under such plan and, if applicable, the associated currently
effective summary plan description, to clarify that such plan does not provide
for, and no former employee or retiree of the Polycom Companies is eligible
for, any post-termination of employment heath or welfare benefit coverage
other than coverage required to be provided under applicable Law and (ii)
provide to applicable participants a notice that describes the eligibility
provisions of each such U.S. Polycom Plan, which notice will not include any
reference to retiree or post-termination coverage and will specify that the
contents of such notice supersede all prior communications or other documents
provided to participants as they relate to eligibility under such U.S. Polycom
Plan.

(b) If, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer makes a
written request to Polycom or Seller that Polycom terminate the Polycom, Inc.
401(k) Retirement Savings Incentive Plan (the "Polycom 401(k) Plan") and such
request includes a commitment that all participants in the Polycom 401(k) Plan
who are Continuing Employees will be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan
maintained by a Buyer Company within one (1) payroll period following the
Closing Date, then Polycom shall take, or Seller shall cause Polycom to take,
all actions necessary to terminate the Polycom 401(k) Plan effective no later
than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, including notifying all
related service providers and Polycom 401(k) Plan participants of such
termination.

(c) Polycom shall provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity (which shall not
be required to be longer than three (3) days) to review and provide comments
with respect to all written broad-based notices, correspondence, and
communications that are provided by Polycom to Polycom Employees prior to the
Closing Date related to the compensation and benefits that may be provided by
a Polycom Company or a Buyer Company after the Closing Date, including the
notices described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Section. Polycom shall
consider in good faith and, if appropriate, accept and integrate all
reasonable comments provided by Buyer, provided that they are not unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Polycom LTIP shall be amended to provide that
(i) subject to the last sentence of this paragraph (d), it shall be
administered by Seller or a designee thereof and (ii) no additional IRs may be
granted under the LTIP on or after the Closing Date. Seller and Buyer agree to
cooperate in good faith after the date hereof to determine whether an
alternative method to that described in clause (i) of this Section 6.15(d) and
in Section 7.8(c) for administering the Polycom LTIP could be implemented that
would (x) better reflect that, although Polycom remains the sponsor of the
Polycom LTIP, Seller is responsible for payments under the Polycom LTIP and/or
(y) result in a lesser Tax liability on Seller and its Affiliates and the
participants in the Polycom LTIP, provided that such change does not result in
a greater Tax liability to Buyer and its Affiliates.

6.16. Black Duck Scan. Prior to the Closing, Polycom shall, at its sole
expense, (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to direct Synopsis to
complete its report (based on the scope of Synopsis' engagement by Polycom
prior to the date hereof), utilizing the Black Duck software that has been
commissioned by Polycom and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
remediate any "flags" identified in such report with respect to license
violations or security vulnerabilities in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Buyer. Buyer will reimburse Polycom for the $272,000 cost of engaging Synopsis
in connection with the report described in the foregoing sentence.

7. COVENANTS AFTER THE CLOSING

7.1. Post-Closing Access to Information; Cooperation.

(a) Access to Information. After the Closing, each Party shall afford each
other Party, its counsel, accountants and other representatives, during normal
business hours, reasonable access to the books, records and other data or
information in such Party's possession relating directly or indirectly to the
assets, Liabilities or operations of the Polycom Companies with respect to
periods prior to the Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts
therefrom at its expense, to the extent such access is required by the
requesting Party for the defense or management of any Tax Proceeding. Without
limitation, after the Closing, each Party shall make available to each other
Party, as reasonably requested, and to any Tax authority that is legally
permitted to receive the following pursuant to its subpoena power or its
equivalent, all books, records and other data relating to Tax Liabilities or
potential Tax Liabilities of the Polycom Companies for all periods prior to or
including the Closing Date and shall preserve all such books, records and
other data until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations for
assessment or refund of Taxes or extensions thereof. Subject to the previous
sentence, each Party agrees, for a period of six (6) years plus ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, not to destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the
books, records or other data described in this Section 7.1(a) without first
offering in writing to surrender such books, records and other data to the
other Parties, which other Parties shall have ten (10) days after such offer
to agree in writing to take possession thereof.

(b) Cooperation. Each Party shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other Party, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to Section 7.2; and (ii) any Litigation (including insurance claims)
brought by or against any third party in connection with (a) any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or (b) any fact or condition relating to the
assets, Liabilities or operations of the Polycom Companies. Such cooperation
shall include making available to the requesting Party, at such times and
under such circumstances so as not to unreasonably disrupt business, the
relevant information, documents, records and employees of the cooperating
Party, allowing the relevant personnel of the cooperating Party to assist the
requesting Party in participating in any such matter (including providing
testimony or other statement in connection with any relevant proceeding),
executing and delivering documents or instruments and taking all such action
as the requesting Party reasonably requests in connection with such matter;
provided, however, that the requesting Party shall promptly reimburse the
cooperating Party for all out-of-pocket costs, for a pro-rata portion of the
salary (including fringe benefits with such pro-rata portion determined based
upon the time spent in connection with cooperation) and for travel and
subsistence expenses directly relating to such cooperation of any of the
cooperating Party's employees who assist the requesting Party (unless the
contesting or defending party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Article 10). Each Party agrees, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other Party, to use its respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or other Person
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller
further agree, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party,
to provide such other Party with all information that either Party may be
required to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (if any).

(c) Consultation with Advisors. Seller consents to Buyer's consultation with
legal, accounting and other professional advisors to the Polycom Companies and
Seller relating to the advice rendered to any Polycom Company or Seller prior
to the Closing regarding the assets, Liabilities or operations of the Polycom
Companies, excluding, however, the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Adversarial Proceedings Involving Parties. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this Section 7.1, although the existence of a dispute or other adversarial
proceeding between or among any of the Parties shall not abrogate or suspend
the provisions of this Section 7.1, as to such records or other information
directly pertinent to such dispute or other adversarial proceeding, the
Parties may not utilize this Section 7.1, but rather, absent agreement, must
utilize the rules of discovery (to the extent applicable).

7.2. Tax Matters.

(a) Seller-Prepared Tax Returns. Between the Agreement Date and the Closing
Date, Seller shall file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis, all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by the Polycom Companies on or prior to
the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with
applicable Law. Seller shall provide Buyer with completed drafts of such Tax
Returns (including any related work papers or other information reasonably
requested by Buyer) for Buyer's review and comment at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing and shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments thereto. Seller, or such Polycom Company as may be or is
obligated to pay, shall timely pay (or cause to be paid, but in each case at
the expense of Seller) all Taxes due and payable on the Tax Returns filed
under this Section 7.2(a). If Buyer does not provide Seller with a written
description of the items in the Tax Returns or the tax statement that Buyer
intends to dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days following the delivery to
Buyer of such documents, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to
such documents in the form provided, and Seller shall thereafter cause all
such Tax Returns to be timely filed.

(b) Buyer-Prepared Tax Returns. Buyer shall have the right to prepare, approve
and/or file, or to cause the Polycom Companies to prepare, approve and/or
file, all Tax Returns for the Polycom Companies for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Law
and in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Polycom Companies to the
extent consistent with applicable Law. Buyer shall provide Seller with
completed drafts of such Tax Returns (including any related work papers or
other information reasonably requested by Seller) for Seller's review and
comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing and shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments thereto. Buyer shall not make
any changes to such Tax Returns without the prior written approval of Seller
(which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
Buyer and Seller agree to timely consult with each other and to negotiate in
good faith any timely-raised issue arising as a result of the review of such
Tax Returns to permit the filing of such Tax Returns as promptly as possible,
which good faith negotiations shall include each side exchanging in writing
their positions concerning the matter(s) in dispute and a meeting to discuss
their respective positions. In the event Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve any dispute within ten (10) Business Days following the delivery of
written notice by Seller of such dispute, Seller or Buyer may require that
they mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same shall be finally
resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by, a U.S.
recognized accounting firm mutually agreed to by Seller and Buyer (the
accounting firm ultimately chosen, the "Accounting Referee"), and they shall
jointly request the Accounting Referee to resolve any issue in dispute at
least ten (10) Business Days before the due date of such Tax Return so that
such Tax Return may be timely filed. The Accounting Referee shall make a
determination with respect to any disputed issue within five (5) Business Days
before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the Tax Return in
question, and Seller shall cause the Polycom Companies to file such Tax Return
on the due date (including extensions) therefor in a manner consistent with
the determination of the Accounting Referee. The determination of the
Accounting Referee shall be binding; provided, however, that any such
determination shall be limited to the resolution of issues in dispute. The
fees and disbursements of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by the
Parties.

(c) Tax Periods Beginning On Or Before and Ending After the Closing Date.
Buyer shall cause to be prepared and filed any Tax Returns of the Polycom
Companies for Tax periods that begin on or before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date. Buyer shall provide Seller with summary calculations
and results which shall appear in such Tax Returns for Seller's review and
comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing and shall
incorporate any reasonable comments thereto made by Seller, but Buyer shall
have no obligation, and shall not, provide Buyer Tax Returns for Seller's
review. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of written notice
of the amount of Taxes with respect to such periods by Buyer or the Polycom
Companies to Seller, Seller shall pay to Buyer and/or the Polycom Companies an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes that relates to the portion of such
Tax period ending on the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes are not
reflected in the reserve for Tax liability shown on the face of the Final
Closing Statement. For purposes of this Section 7.2(c), in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such
Taxes that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing
Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related
to income, disbursements (including payroll) or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period; and (B) in the case of any Taxes based upon or
related to income, disbursements (including payroll) or receipts, be deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on
the Closing Date, using the "closing of the books" method of accounting, and
in a manner consistent with the Polycom Recent Balance Sheet. This Section
7.2(c) shall be subject to the same dispute resolution procedure as set forth
above in Section 7.2(a); provided, however, that Buyer shall have no
obligation to, and shall not, provide Seller with copies or drafts of Buyer
Tax Returns. Unless necessary to comply with applicable law, neither Buyer nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall (or shall cause or permit any Polycom Company)
unreasonably amend, unreasonably refile or otherwise unreasonably modify (or
grant an extension of any statute of limitations with respect to) any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to any Polycom Company with respect to any
taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or with respect to
any taxable period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date
without the prior consent of Seller or take any other action that would in bad
faith increase any Tax liability or reduce any Tax benefit in respect of any
taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or any taxable
period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Section 7.2(c), Buyer
shall not be precluded from restructuring, consolidating, or otherwise
effecting or implementing any corporate or tax action or internal transaction
in the normal course of its business where such action is determined by Buyer
to be in the best interests of Buyer (and its new consolidated group which
includes the Polycom Companies) after the Closing (for instance, including (i)
where such action may prompt an expedited tax clearing process or review, (ii)
where in the case where there may be a Polycom Company tax matter outstanding
or in dispute but Buyer determined in the normal course of its business and
integration of the Polycom Companies that liquidating or dissolving business
units at Buyer's discretion should occur), or (iii) such other similar and
dissimilar cases and circumstances each in the business judgment of Buyer in
the ordinary course of Buyer's business; provided, however, in each case, that
Buyer may not (and may not cause or permit any Polycom Company to) file any
voluntary disclosures or take any similar actions with respect to Tax Returns
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the consent of Seller.

(d) Tax Proceedings. If an audit, investigation or similar proceeding with
respect to any Tax matter shall be commenced, or a claim shall be made, by any
Governmental Authority, with respect to (i) any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date or any taxable period beginning on or before and
ending after the Closing Date or (ii) Taxes for which Seller may be liable
pursuant to this Agreement, then Buyer shall, or shall cause the Polycom
Companies to, promptly (but no later than thirty (30) days) notify Seller in
writing of such audit, investigation or similar proceeding or claim (a "Tax
Proceeding"), provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Buyer Indemnified Parties' right to indemnification except to the
extent that Seller are materially prejudiced by such failure. Seller shall
have the primary right, at their sole expense, to contest any Tax Proceeding
relating to (i) a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or any
taxable period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date or
(ii) Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to this Agreement; and
Buyer shall have the primary right to contest all other such Tax Proceedings
(the party controlling such Tax Proceeding hereinafter referred to as the
"Controlling Party"). The Controlling Party shall have discretion and
authority to pay, settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding (including
selection of counsel, the pursuit or waiver of any administrative proceeding
or the right to pay the Tax and sue for a refund or contest the Tax Proceeding
in any permissible manner); provided, however, that (i) Buyer or Seller, as
applicable (the "Non-Controlling Party") (or their advisors), may fully
participate at the Non-Controlling Party's expense in the Tax Proceeding and
(ii) the Controlling Party shall not settle any Tax Proceeding in a manner
that would materially and adversely affect the Non-Controlling Party without
the prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Controlling Party
shall keep the Non-Controlling Party timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any Tax Proceeding. Upon the conclusion of
any Tax Proceeding in accordance with the foregoing, whether by way of
settlement or otherwise, Buyer shall cause the Polycom Companies and an
appropriate officer of each Polycom Company to execute any and all agreements,
instruments or other documents that are necessary or appropriate to conclude
such Tax Proceeding. To the extent this Section 7.2(d) conflicts with Section
10.4, this Section 7.2(d) shall control.

(e) Transfer Taxes. Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand,
shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of all sales, use,
documentary stamp, transfer, registration and other Taxes, together with all
recording expenses and notarial fees, attributable to, imposed upon or arising
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes").
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in the filing of all such relevant Transfer
Tax related Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes,
and the applicable other Party shall join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. Seller and Buyer shall
reimburse each other for its share of any Transfer Taxes borne by, paid or
otherwise suffered by the other Party. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon
request, to use reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any such Taxes that could be imposed with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) Tax Sharing Agreement. All Tax sharing Contracts or similar Contracts with
respect to or involving any Polycom Company shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no Polycom Company shall be bound
thereby or have any Liability thereunder, and such Contracts shall have no
further effect for any Tax year (whether the current year, a future year, or a
past year).

(g) Tax Treatment of Payments. Any payments pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated by the Parties, for Tax purposes, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

7.3. Nonsolicitation; Certain Companies. As an inducement to Buyer to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to preserve the goodwill associated with the Business, for a period
of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and
Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
induce or otherwise offer employment or engagement as an independent
contractor to, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed
specifically to any such employees, or engage in discussions regarding
employment or engagement as an independent contractor with, any person who is
or was employed at a level of senior director or above or as a commissioned
salesperson or engineer of Polycom or of the Polycom Companies or assist any
third party with respect to any of the foregoing, unless (i) such person has
been terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including each Polycom
Company), (ii) such person has been separated from his or her employment or
other relationship with Buyer and each of its Affiliates (including each
Polycom Company) for a period of six (6) consecutive months prior to any such
solicitation, inducement or offer of employment or (iii) such person responds
to a general solicitation that is not directed specifically to any such
employees. Buyer and Seller agree that the foregoing restrictions applicable
to Buyer and its Affiliates shall not apply with respect to any individual
identified on Schedule 7.3; provided, however, the foregoing restriction shall
only apply to Seller\'s Affiliates that are portfolio companies to the extent
such Seller\'s Affiliates are acting at the direction of Seller or the funds
managed by Seller or Seller\'s Affiliates. In addition, in the event that
Seller or any of its Affiliates intends to enter into any non-disclosure
agreement, indication of interest, letter of intent or similar agreement with
regard to any of the companies listed on Schedule 7.3 (other than such an
agreement relating to the sale or other disposal of any interest in any of the
portfolio companies of Seller or any of its Affiliates), Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing prior to its execution thereof, and Buyer, at its sole
option exercised by written notice to Seller delivered within ten calendar
days of receipt of such notice from Seller, may direct any conflicted member
of the board of directors of Buyer designated by Seller to resign from the
board of directors of Buyer (and Seller or such Affiliate shall cause such
individual to so resign). Further, if Buyer directs any such member of the
board to resign, then Seller and its Affiliates shall be prohibited from
executing a definitive agreement with or relating to such company or its
Affiliates for three (3) months, but this prohibition on executing a
definitive agreement shall not apply to a definitive agreement with or
relating to the companies listed on Schedule 7.3.

7.4. Confidential Information. For a period of three (3) years after the
Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates that have received
Confidential Information not to, directly or indirectly, (a) use any
Confidential Information for any purpose, other than in connection with
Seller's ownership and/or disposition of Buyer Common Stock in compliance with
applicable Law; (b) disclose any Confidential Information to any Person other
than Buyer or its Affiliates (including each Polycom Company) or any agents,
consultants, members, partners, directors, officers, employees, attorneys,
accountants, advisors, Financing Sources, or representatives of Seller or any
of its Affiliates (to the extent they actually receive Confidential
Information, "Seller Representatives"); or (c) assist any other Person in
engaging in any of the foregoing, except to the extent necessary to comply
with the express terms of any written agreement between Seller and Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, for this purpose, each Polycom Company) and
except to the extent explicitly requested in writing by Buyer. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller and the Seller Representatives may disclose Confidential
Information at such times, in such manner and to the extent such disclosure is
required by applicable Law, provided that Seller (i) provides Buyer with
prompt written notice thereof to the extent permitted by Law; (ii) limits such
disclosure to what is required as reasonably determined by Seller's counsel;
and (iii) at Buyer's request and sole expense, attempts to preserve the
confidentiality of any Confidential Information so disclosed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller and the Seller Representatives may disclose Confidential
Information without providing the foregoing notice or performing such required
actions, pursuant to a request made by a banking financial, accounting,
securities or similar supervisory entity exercising its supervisory or audit
authority under any law, rule, regulation, or administrative or legal process;
provided that such requests are not specifically directed at the Buyer or its
Affiliates or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement reduces any obligation of Seller to comply with applicable Laws or
Orders relating to trade secrets, confidential information and unfair
competition. If, at any time after the Closing, Seller discovers that it is in
possession of any records containing any Confidential Information, then Seller
shall immediately deliver such records to Buyer. Seller shall not assert a
waiver or loss of confidential or privileged status of the information based
upon such possession or discovery.

Buyer acknowledges that in the ordinary course of business, Seller and its
Affiliates pursue, acquire, manage and serve on the boards of companies that
may be competitors or potential competitors to Buyer and the Polycom
Companies, and that their review of Confidential Information will inevitably
enhance their knowledge and understanding of Buyer and the Polycom Companies'
industry in a way that cannot be separated from their historical knowledge.
Accordingly, Buyer agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall not restrict their use of such knowledge and
understanding, including in connection with the purchase, sale, consideration
and oversight of any other investments or investment opportunities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
foregoing does not grant Seller or its Affiliates any license under any
patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights of
Buyer, its Affiliates or any Polycom Company.

7.5. Seller Ongoing Obligations. Seller shall not transfer or enter into any
proposed sale, exchange, dividend or other distribution or liquidation of all
or a significant portion of its assets in one or a series of transactions or
any significant recapitalization or reclassification of its outstanding
securities with the intent to, or in a manner reasonably expected to, or for
the purpose to avoid or limit its indemnification obligations, as applicable,
under this Agreement, for so long as Seller has any continuing indemnification
obligations under this Agreement.

7.6. Obihai Earnout. In the event that the Deferred Payment Amount set forth
in the Obihai Acquisition Agreement that is actually paid by Polycom is less
than the Obihai Indebtedness Amount (such difference, the "Excess Obihai
Amount"), Buyer shall pay the Excess Obihai Amount to Seller within ten (10)
Business Days after the Deferred Payment Amount payment is made.

7.7. Project X Settlement. In the event that the aggregate amount of all
Polycom Losses relating to the Project X Litigation from the Closing Date to
the date that the Project X Litigation is settled and all Polycom payments and
other obligations in relation to such settlement are paid in full and
satisfied (such date, the "Project X Settlement Date") is less than the
Project X Indebtedness Amount (such difference, the "Project X Excess
Amount"), Buyer shall pay the Project X Excess Amount to Seller within ten
(10) Business Days following the Project X Settlement Date.

7.8. Post-Closing Employee Matters.

(a) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause to be waived any pre-existing conditions limitations, exclusions,
waiting periods, required physical examinations or similar limitations under
any welfare benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates that is
not a Polycom Plan in which the employees of a Polycom Company who continue to
be employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Polycom Company)
(individually a "Continuing Employee" and collectively the "Continuing
Employees") (or their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate
from and after the Closing Date, except to the extent that such pre-existing
conditions limitations, exclusions, waiting periods, required physical
examinations or similar limitation would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Polycom Plan in which the Continuing Employees
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause to be recognized the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible, co-payment, or
similar limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which the
Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time that is not a Polycom Plan.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to
any Continuing Employees who (i) are based outside of the United States,
Buyer's obligations under this Section 7.8 shall be in addition to, but not in
contravention of, any obligations under the Law of the non-U.S. countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Continuing Employees are based,
or (ii) are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, Platinum's
obligations under this Section 7.8 shall (A) be in addition to, but not in
contravention of, the terms and conditions of employment for such Continuing
Employees as set forth in such Collective Bargaining Agreement until its
expiration, modification or termination in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law and (B) apply only to the extent permitted by applicable labor
Law and the terms and conditions set forth in such Collective Bargaining
Agreement without requiring an amendment or any consent from the unions or
collective bargaining representative.

(c) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Polycom
Companies) to, honor the terms of the Polycom LTIP, taking into account the
amendment contemplated by Section 6.15(d). On the fourteen (14) month
anniversary of the Closing, Buyer will pay to Seller an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between (i) Polycom LTIP Indebtedness, less (ii) the
amount paid by Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Polycom Companies) in
respect of the Polycom LTIP during such fourteen (14) month period (including
the employer portion of any payroll, social security or similar Taxes). At any
time following such fourteen (14) month period at which payments are due to
participants in the Polycom LTIP (or if payments due prior to such time exceed
the Polycom LTIP Indebtedness) Seller shall make a payment to Buyer equal to
the amount of such payments (including the employer portion of any payroll,
social security or similar Taxes) and, upon receipt, Buyer shall, or shall
cause its applicable Affiliate to, pay such amounts to the applicable
participants in the Polycom LTIP (or their respective beneficiaries).

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.8, expressed or implied, shall (i) be
treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any Polycom Plan or
constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify, merge or terminate after
the Closing Date any Polycom Plan, (ii) give any current or former employee,
director or other independent contractor of any Polycom Company (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof), any labor organization, union, works
council, employee association, trade union or other similar employee
representative body or any other Person any third-party beneficiary or other
rights under this Agreement or otherwise or (iii) obligate Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Polycom Plan or (B) retain the
employment or services of any current or former employee, director or other
independent contractor of any Polycom Company.

7.9. Further Assurances. From time to time after the Agreement Date, upon
request of any Party and without further consideration, each Party shall
execute and deliver to the requesting Party such documents and take such
action as may reasonably requested by the requesting Party to consummate more
effectively the intent and purpose of the Parties under this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.10. Concerning Counsel.

(a) Sidley Austin LLP ("Counsel") has been engaged by Seller to represent
Seller and its Subsidiaries, including the Company, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer (on its behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) hereby (i) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after
the Closing between Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Seller and/or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, Counsel may represent
Seller and/or any of its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests
of Seller and/or any of its Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer and
its Affiliates and even though Counsel may have represented the Buyer
Affiliates (prior to Closing) in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer or Polycom Companies and
(ii) waives any conflict in connection therewith. Buyer (on its behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates) further agrees that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, as to all communications among Counsel, Seller
and the Polycom Companies (including any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or other Representatives) (the "Designated Persons") to
the extent relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
are subject to the attorney-client privilege, and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to Seller and shall be controlled by Seller and shall not
pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Polycom Companies or any of their
Affiliates; provided, that the foregoing shall not extend to any communication
not involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or to
communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons and their
advisors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer, the Polycom Companies or any of their respective Affiliates and
a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, Buyer
may assert (or cause to be asserted) the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Counsel to such third party;
provided, however, that to the extent such dispute relates to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer may not waive (or permit the
waiver of) such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) Foley and Lardner LLP ("Buyer's Counsel") has been engaged by Buyer to
represent Buyer and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Seller (on its behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries)
hereby (i) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Buyer and/or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller
and/or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, Buyer's Counsel may represent
Buyer and/or any of its Subsidiaries in such dispute even though the interests
of Buyer and/or any of its Subsidiaries may be directly adverse to Seller and
its Affiliates and even though Buyer's Counsel may have obtained privileged or
confidential information relating to Seller and/or any of its Affiliates
(prior to Closing) in matters substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Seller or Polycom Companies and (ii) waives any
conflict in connection therewith.

(c) This Section 7.10 is not intended to, and the Parties hereby agree that it
does not, and will not, supersede the provisions of any common interest
agreement among the Parties and their respective counsel. This Section is also
not intended to, and the Parties hereby agree that it does not, and will not,
supersede the provisions of § 259 of the Delaware General Corporation Law with
respect to Buyer's ownership of any privileges or other confidentiality
protections related to the assets which are the subject of this Agreement,
except as specifically provided for herein.

10.1. Indemnification by Seller.

(a) General. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Article 10, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Polycom Companies), and their
respective equity holders, directors, officers, employees, agents and other
representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), from and
against all Losses resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by any Buyer
Indemnified Party, by reason of, arising out of or resulting from: (i) any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Polycom or Seller
contained in this Agreement; (ii) any breach of any covenant of Polycom or
Seller contained in this Agreement (regardless of whether such breach is
deemed "material"); (iii) any Polycom Indebtedness outstanding as of the
Effective Time that is not repaid at Closing or included (on a dollar for
dollar basis) as Retained Indebtedness in the calculation of the Final
Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Closing Statement; (iv) any Polycom
Transaction Expenses; (v) any Indemnified Taxes; (vi) any of the matters
described on Schedule 10.1(a)(vi); or (vii) the LandR Matters.

(b) Limitations. Seller's obligations under Section 10.1(a) shall be subject
to the following limitations:

(i) Seller will have no liability for Losses under clause (i) of Section
10.1(a) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses thereunder for which Seller
would be liable exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), in which case
Seller would be liable only for the amount of Losses in excess of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000); provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this
Section 10.1(b)(i) shall not apply to the extent such Losses result from any
inaccuracy or breach of a Fundamental Polycom Representation or the Specified
Representation;

(ii) Seller will have no liability for Losses under clause (i) and clause (vi)
of Section 10.1(a) to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Losses for
which Seller would otherwise be required to provide indemnification exceeds,
on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to the then-remaining General Escrow
Assets, which General Escrow Assets shall be the sole and exclusive source of
recovery available to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Agreement with
respect to Losses under clause (i) and clause (vi) of Section 10.1(a);
provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this Section 10.1(b)(ii)
shall not apply to the extent such Losses result from any inaccuracy or breach
of a Fundamental Polycom Representation or the Specified Representation;

(iii) Seller will have no liability for Losses under clause (vii) of Section
10.1(a) to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Losses for which Seller
would otherwise be required to provide indemnification exceeds, on a
cumulative basis, (x) the then-remaining LandR Matters Escrow Amount plus (y)
the lesser of (I) Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) from the General
Escrow Assets or (II) the then-remaining General Escrow Assets;

(iv) Seller will have no liability for Losses under (A) clause (i) of Section
10.1(a), including to the extent such Losses result from any inaccuracy or
breach of a Fundamental Polycom Representation or the Specified
Representation, and (B) clause (v) of Section 10.1(a) that exceed, on a
cumulative basis, an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by
Seller;

(v) the obligation of Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
against any Losses under Section 10.1(a) shall be reduced (on a dollar-for-
dollar basis) by the amount of any reserve, provision or allowance (in the
form of an accrued Current Liability or an offset to a Current Asset) that was
included in the calculation of the Final Adjusted Net Working Capital Amount
as set forth on the Final Closing Statement relating specifically to the
matter for which Seller would otherwise be required to provide such
indemnification;

(vi) the obligation of Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
Losses under Section 10.1(a) shall be reduced (A) by the amount of any
indemnification payment actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
from any third party in respect of such Losses; (B) by the amount of any
insurance proceeds actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties from any
third party insurer (including the RandW Insurance Provider under the RandW
Insurance Policy as set forth in Section 10.5) with respect to such Losses, in
each case, net of any deductibles or other costs and expenses (including any
increase in insurance premiums that has occurred or is reasonably likely to
occur as a result of such claim, whether by retrospective or retroactive
premium adjustments or otherwise, giving effect to the present value of any
such premium increase over the period for which it is reasonably anticipated
to be effective) incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Parties in procuring such
recovery; and (C) with respect to claims satisfied from the Special Escrow
Account or General Escrow Account, by the amount of any net Tax benefits
actually realized (calculated on an "with and without" basis) as a reduction
in cash Taxes paid by the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising from such Loss in
the taxable year in which such Loss was sustained or in the taxable year
following the year in which such Loss was sustained (it being understood that
this clause (C) shall apply only with respect to any claim or claims
aggregating to at least $5,000,000 in a calendar year); provided, however,
that if Seller pays to any Buyer Indemnified Party an amount in respect of
Losses and the Buyer Indemnified Parties thereafter receive from a third party
(including the RandW Insurance Provider under the RandW Insurance Policy as set
forth in Section 10.5) a sum in respect of such Losses, then Buyer shall
promptly tender to Seller an amount equal to the lesser of such sum and the
amount that Seller paid in respect of such Losses; and

(vii) Seller shall not have any liability for Losses under clause (i) and
clause (vi) of Section 10.1(a) following the date that is eighteen (18) months
after the Closing; provided, however, that (A) there shall be no time
limitation on any claim for inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental Polycom
Representation; (B) claims for breach of the Specified Representation and
Indemnified Taxes shall survive the Closing until the date that is sixty (60)
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; and (C) a
Buyer Indemnified Party shall preserve its right to pursue a claim under
clause (i) and clause (vi) of Section 10.1(a) with respect to a particular
breach if such Buyer Indemnified Party delivers a notice that constitutes an
Indemnification Notice (as defined below), but only with respect to the
breach, and the underlying facts and circumstances of such breach, described
in such Indemnification Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller's
indemnification obligations with respect to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v)
of Section 10.1(a) shall not expire, and Seller's indemnification obligations
with respect to clause (vii) of Section 10.1(a) shall expire upon the LandR
Matters Completion Date except that a Buyer Indemnified Party shall preserve
its right to pursue a claim under clause (vii) of Section 10.1(a) with respect
to a matter if such Buyer Indemnified Party delivers a notice that constitutes
an Indemnification Notice, but only with respect to the matter, and the
underlying facts and circumstances of such matter, described in such
Indemnification Notice.

10.2. Indemnification by Buyer.

(a) General. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Article 10, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates,
and their respective equity holders, directors, officers, employees, heirs,
executors, agents and other representatives, as applicable (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties"), from and against all Losses, resulting to,
imposed upon or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party, by reason of,
arising out of or resulting from: (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement; and (ii) any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement (regardless of whether such breach is deemed
"material").

(b) Limitations. Buyer's obligations under Section 10.2(a), shall be subject
to the following limitations:

(i) Buyer shall have no liability for Losses under clause (i) of Section
10.2(a) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses thereunder for which Buyer
would be liable exceeds $3,618,277, in which case Buyer would be liable only
for the amount of Losses in excess of $3,618,277; provided, however, that the
limitation set forth in this Section 10.2(b)(i) shall not apply to the extent
such Losses result from any inaccuracy or breach of a Fundamental Buyer
Representation or the Specified Buyer Representation;

(ii) Buyer shall have no liability for Losses under clause (i) of Section
10.2(a) to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Losses for which Buyer
would otherwise be required to provide indemnification exceeds, on a
cumulative basis, an amount equal to $36,182,772 and

(iii) Buyer shall not have any liability for Losses under clause (i) of
Section 10.2(a) following the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing; provided, however, that (A) there shall be no time limitation on any
claim for inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental Buyer Representations; (B)
claims for breach of the Specified Buyer Representation shall survive the
Closing until the date that is the earlier of (x) thirty (30) months after the
Closing and (y) the sale of all of the shares of Buyer Common Stock owned by
Seller; and (C) a Seller Indemnified Party shall preserve its right to pursue
a claim under clause (i) of Section 10.2(a) with respect to a particular
breach if such Seller Indemnified Party, prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period specified in this Section 10.2(b)(iii), delivers a
notice that constitutes an Indemnification Notice, but only with respect to
the breach, and the underlying facts and circumstances of such breach,
described in such Indemnification Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer's
indemnification obligations with respect to clause (ii) of Section 10.2(a)
shall not expire.

10.3. Procedures Relating to Indemnification among Seller and Buyer. Following
the discovery of any facts or conditions that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to a Loss or Losses for which indemnification under this Article 10
may be obtained, the Party seeking indemnification under this Article 10 (the
"Indemnified Party") shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, provide
written notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent, setting forth the
specific facts and circumstances, in reasonable detail, relating to such Loss
or Losses, the amount of such Loss or Losses (or a non-binding, reasonable
estimate thereof if the actual amount is not capable of reasonable
calculation) and the specific Section(s) of this Agreement upon which the
Indemnified Party is relying in seeking such indemnification (an
"Indemnification Notice"). An Indemnified Party's failure to provide an
Indemnification Notice within the time period specified above shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations with
respect to the subject of the Indemnification Notice, except to the extent
(and only to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result of
such failure.

10.4. Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims and the
Specific Indemnified Matters.

(a) Notice. For an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement arising out of or involving a claim or
demand made by any third party, including any Governmental Authority
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any claim or demand arising under the
Specific Indemnified Matters, a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party
shall promptly provide the Indemnifying Party with an Indemnification Notice
relating to the Third Party Claim and Specific Indemnified Claim (provided
that no notice is required in connection with the LandR Matters). An Indemnified
Party's failure to provide an Indemnification Notice within such reasonable
time shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification
obligations with respect to the subject of the Indemnification Notice, except
to the extent (and only to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as
a result of such failure.

(b) Defense of Third Party Claims. If a Third Party Claim is made against an
Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled (at its sole
discretion) to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified
Party elects to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, then (1)
Indemnifying shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal fees or
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such Third Party Claim, so long as the Indemnified Party continues to defend
such Third Party Claim; (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at
its sole expense, to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and
to employ counsel separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnified Party,
it being understood, however, that the Indemnified Party shall control such
defense; and (3) the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in all respects in the
defense of such Third Party Claim, which cooperation shall include but not be
limited to the retention and provision to the Indemnified Party relevant
information, documents, records and employees of the cooperating Party,
allowing the relevant personnel of the cooperating Party to assist the
requesting Party in participating in any such matter (including providing
testimony in connection with any relevant proceeding), executing and
delivering documents or instruments, and taking all such action as the
Indemnified Party reasonably requests in connection with such matter. Any
settlement or compromise of a Third Party Claim by any Indemnified Party shall
be subject to the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and the Indemnified
Party shall regularly consult with the Indemnifying Party in connection with
any Third Party Claim. Following the Closing, this Section 10.4(b) shall
apply, mutatis mutandis¸ to the claims against the Polycom Companies
contemplated in Section 7.6 and Section 7.7.

(c) Defense of the Specific Indemnified Matters. After the Closing, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled (at Buyer's sole discretion) to assume
the defense of any claim or demand relating to the Specific Indemnified
Matters (a "Specific Indemnified Claim"). If a Buyer Indemnified Party elects
to assume the defense of any Specific Indemnified Claim, then (1) Seller shall
be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Party for any legal fees (except, with
respect to the LandR Matters, to the extent of any transition costs to new
counsel where Buyer and Polycom determine to cease using Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich and Rosati as sole legal counsel, which the Buyer Indemnified Party
shall bear) or expenses subsequently incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Party
in connection with such Specific Indemnified Claim, so long as the Buyer
Indemnified Party continues to defend such Specific Indemnified Claim actively
and in good faith; (2) Seller shall have the right, at Seller's sole expense,
to participate in the defense of such Specific Indemnified Claim and to employ
counsel separate from the counsel employed by the Buyer Indemnified Party, it
being understood, however, that the Buyer Indemnified Party shall control such
defense; (3) Seller shall cooperate in all respects in the defense of such
Specific Indemnified Claim, which cooperation shall include but not be limited
to the retention and provision to the Buyer Indemnified Party relevant
information, documents, records and employees of Seller, allowing the relevant
personnel of Seller to assist the Buyer Indemnified Party in participating in
any such matter (including providing testimony in connection with any relevant
proceeding), executing and delivering documents or instruments, and taking all
such action as the Buyer Indemnified Party reasonably requests in connection
with such matter; and (4) any settlement or compromise of a Specific
Indemnified Claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party shall be subject to the prior
written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and the Indemnified Party shall regularly consult with
the Indemnifying Party in connection with any Specific Indemnified Claim.

10.5. Indemnification Waterfall. All claims made by any Buyer Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Article 10 with respect to the LandR Matters shall be
exclusively satisfied first from the Special Escrow Account until its
depletion and second from the General Escrow Account until the earlier of its
expiration or depletion. All claims made by any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article 10, except claims relating to the LandR Matters (which
shall be satisfied as provided in the previous sentence) shall be satisfied
from the sources and in order of priority set forth immediately below:

(a) First, from the General Escrow Account until the aggregate of all Losses
as finally determined pursuant to this Agreement against Seller that are
satisfied from the General Escrow Account exceed Thirty Five Million Dollars
($35,000,000), with any excess being satisfied pursuant to Section 10.5(b),
Section 10.5(c) or Section 10.5(d), as applicable;

(b) Second, from the RandW Insurance Policy until the aggregate of all Losses as
finally determined pursuant to this Agreement against Seller that are
satisfied from the RandW Insurance Policy exceed the coverage limit of the RandW
Insurance Policy, with any excess being satisfied pursuant to Section 10.5(c);
provided, however, that any claim that is not covered by the RandW Insurance
Policy shall be satisfied first from the General Escrow Account until the
earlier of its expiration or depletion and, second, in accordance with Section
10.5(d), as applicable;

(c) Third, from the General Escrow Account until the earlier of its expiration
or depletion; and

(d) Fourth, solely with respect to claims relating to (i) the Fundamental
Polycom Representations and the Specified Representation, (ii) Section
10.1(a)(ii), (iii) Section 10.1(a)(iv), (iv) Section 10.1(a)(v), or (v) any
Indemnified Taxes, directly from Seller, to the extent not satisfied under any
other provision of this Section 10.5.

10.6. Pre-Closing Officers and Directors. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any Organizational Documents of any Polycom Company, the
pre-Closing directors and officers of each Polycom Company shall not be
entitled to exculpation, indemnification or contribution from Buyer or, after
Closing, any Polycom Company for or in connection with any facts or
circumstances that are the subject matter of or related to an indemnification
claim under this Article 10 brought by any Buyer Indemnified Party.

10.7. Certain Determinations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, for purposes of determining whether there has
been a breach and the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter of a
claim for indemnification hereunder with respect to such breach, each
representation and warranty of a Party set forth in this Agreement shall be
read without regard and without giving effect to the term(s) "material" or
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar materiality qualifiers, in each case, as
if such words and surrounding related words (e.g., "reasonably be expected
to," "could have" and similar restrictions and qualifiers) were deleted from
such representation or warranty; provided, however, that this Section 10.7
shall not apply to the representation and warranty of Polycom and Seller set
forth in clause (C) of Section 4.6(a) and the lead in to Section 4.9 or the
representation and warranty of Buyer set forth in clause (B) of Section 5.6
and the lead in to Section 5.9.

10.8. Mitigation. Each of the Parties agrees to take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Losses, which steps may include
the filing of insurance claims (including under the RandW Insurance Policy, but
recognizing that it may be commercially reasonable to elect not to file an
insurance claim), upon and after any member of executive management of such
Party becomes aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses for which such party may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that Buyer will have no
obligation to litigate or arbitrate with any insurance provider, including the
RandW Insurer Policy provider, with respect to any such insurance claims, and
provided, further, that Buyer will not have any obligation (a) to seek
insurance recovery in respect of Losses to the extent recovery of such Losses
would be precluded or would preclude other (i) pending claims or (ii) claims
reasonably likely, based upon past claims experience, to be submitted as a
result of the applicable policy coverage limit, or (b) to maintain insurance
for the benefit or in the name of the Polycom Companies, or to make the
Polycom Companies named insureds, after the Closing (in each case, other than
the RandW Insurance Policy and the Tail Coverage).

10.9. Subrogation. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying
Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this Article 10) in
connection with any claim or demand by any Person other than the Parties or
their respective Affiliates, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or
circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party may have any right,
defense or claim relating to such claim or demand against any claimant or
plaintiff asserting such claim or demand (except with respect to either
Party's customers, suppliers, employees, licensors and landlords). Such
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting any
subrogated right, defense or claim.

10.10. Exclusive Remedy. Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, except in connection with a dispute under Section 2.4 (which
shall be governed exclusively by Section 2.4), or as provided in Section 7.2
or Section 13.11 or for claims relating to fraud, the indemnification
provisions of Article 10 and the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parties following the Closing for any and all breaches
or alleged breaches of any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties, or any other provision of this Agreement.

10.11. Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants
of an Indemnifying Party, and Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any
of its representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or
any of its representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the
Indemnified Party\'s waiver of any condition set forth in Article 8 or Article
9, as the case may be.

(a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

(b) by either Buyer or Seller in the event the Closing shall not have occurred

or Seller may elect, by providing written notice to the other Party at least

in part to or arising under any Regulatory Law) have not been satisfied on or
before the Termination Date; provided, further, that neither Buyer nor Seller
shall have the right to extend the Termination Date if the failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.5 or Section 9.6 to be satisfied on or
before the Termination Date has resulted from any breach of this Agreement by
such Party (or, with respect to Seller, any Polycom Company); or

(c) by either Buyer or Seller, by providing written notice to the other Party,
if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any final, non-appealable Order or any Law, or refused to

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or that otherwise
prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Agreement shall have become untrue as of any date subsequent to the Agreement

delivered to Seller written notice of such breach or failure to perform; and

representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall have become
untrue as of any date subsequent to the Agreement Date; (B) such breach,
failure to perform or the failure of such representations and warranties to be
true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, (I) would cause either of

and Article 13, and the Parties' obligations under Section 6.5(g), the proviso

13. MISCELLANEOUS

13.1. Disclosure Schedules.

(a) The Polycom Companies and Seller have prepared the schedules to Article 3
and Article 4 attached to this Agreement (individually, a "Schedule" (as
applicable) and collectively, the "Polycom Disclosure Schedule") and delivered
them to Buyer on the Agreement Date. Any information disclosed in a Schedule
shall be deemed to be disclosed to Buyer with respect to each other
representation and warranty in Article 3 and Article 4 to the extent that such
disclosure contains such information so as to enable a reasonable person to
determine that such disclosure qualifies or otherwise applies to such other
representation or warranty. The Polycom Disclosure Schedule shall not vary,
change or alter the language of the representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
the specification of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Polycom Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no Person shall use the fact of the setting forth of any
such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy
between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in the Polycom Disclosure Schedule is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement. The Polycom Disclosure Schedule is
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein.

(b) Buyer has prepared the schedules to Article 5, attached to this Agreement
(individually, a "Buyer Schedule" (as applicable) and collectively, the "Buyer
Disclosure Schedule") and delivered them to Seller on the Agreement Date. Any
information disclosed in a Buyer Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed to
Seller with respect to each other representation and warranty in Article 5 on
each other Buyer Schedule of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule to the extent that
such disclosure contains such information so as to enable a reasonable person
to determine that such disclosure qualifies or otherwise applies to such
representation or warranty. The Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not vary,
change or alter the language of the representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule is intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no Person shall use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. The Buyer Disclosure
Schedule is incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as
though completely set forth herein.

13.2. Publicity. No public release or announcement relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by any Party without
the prior consent of Buyer and Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may,
in the judgment of the releasing Party, be required by Law or Order
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Regulatory Law or by obligations
pursuant to a securities exchange), in which case the Party required to make
the release or announcement shall, to the extent reasonably practicable under
the circumstances, allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) the Parties shall cooperate to prepare a joint press release to
be issued on the Agreement Date and/or the Closing Date; (b) Polycom and
Seller shall provide Buyer access to, and facilitate meetings with, employees,
customers, suppliers and/or distributors of the Polycom Companies for the
purpose of making announcements relating to, and preparing for the
consummation of, the transactions contemplated hereby; and (c) any Party may
disclose information about the transactions contemplated hereby to their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants,
lenders, investors, partners, financing sources, customers, suppliers,
licensors and landlords without any other Party's prior consent.

13.3. Assignment. Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Parties may assign, transfer or otherwise encumber this
Agreement or its rights or obligations hereunder (excluding any collateral
assignment for the benefit of the Financing Sources), in whole or in part,
whether voluntarily or by operation of Law, without the prior written consent
of Buyer and Seller, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall
be void and without legal effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may,
without the consent of Seller, assign all of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to any Affiliate of Buyer, provided that Buyer remains
primarily liable for all of its obligations hereunder.

13.4. Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective heirs,
personal representatives, permitted successors and permitted assigns. Nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person
any right relating in any way to employment or terms of employment with Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including, for this purpose, the Polycom Companies).
Nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights, remedies or claims upon any
Person or entity not a Party or a permitted assignee of a Party except as set
forth in Section 6.5(g), Section 6.12, Article 10 and Section 13.13.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Financing Sources shall
be express third party beneficiaries of this Section 13.4 and Section 13.5,
Section 13.7 and Section 13.13, and each of such Sections shall expressly
inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources shall
be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections.

13.5. Law Governing Agreement; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any choice of law rules that may
direct the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Polycom, on behalf of itself and each Polycom
Company (and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, on behalf of each of
its equity holders, directors, officers and employees) and each of the other
Parties agrees that any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature
(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) against a Financing Source
that is in any way related to this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to any Financing, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict
of law principles (other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York
General Obligations Law); provided that (i) the interpretation of the
definition of Material Adverse Effect and whether or not a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred, (ii) the determination of the accuracy of any
representations made in this Agreement and whether as a result of any
inaccuracy thereof Buyer or its Affiliates have the right to terminate its
obligations under this Agreement or to decline to consummate the transactions
pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) the determination of whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been consummated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case, shall be governed
by, and construed and interpreted solely in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that
would result in the application of the laws of any other state.

(b) The Parties hereby unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware for any actions, suits or proceedings arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Parties waive any objection relating to venue in any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the courts of the
State of Delaware or the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware and expressly waive any respective rights to seek transfer to a
jurisdiction other than the courts of the State of Delaware or the United
States of America located in the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each of Seller and Polycom, on behalf of itself and
each Polycom Company (and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, on
behalf of each of its equity holders, directors, officers and employees),
agree that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to any Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT
TO ANY ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY FINANCING SOURCE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FINANCING (INCLUDING
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE).

13.6. Severability. If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions set forth in Section
7.3 and Section 7.4, are illegal or excessively broad as to duration,
geographical scope or activity, then such provisions shall be construed so
that the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected, but
shall remain in full force and effect, and any such illegal or overly broad
provisions shall be deemed, without further action on the part of any Person,
to be modified, amended and/or limited, but only to the extent necessary to
render the same valid and enforceable in the applicable jurisdiction.

13.7. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only pursuant
to a written instrument executed and delivered by Buyer and Seller; provided,
however, that this Section 13.7, Section 13.4, Section 13.5, and Section 13.13
(and any related definitions insofar as they affect such Sections) may not be
amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a manner adverse to the
Financing Sources, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter.

13.8. Waiver. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be effective unless expressly set forth in writing and
executed by the Party so waiving. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and in any documents
delivered or to be delivered pursuant hereto. The waiver by any Party of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as
a waiver of any subsequent breach.

13.9. Notice. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under
this Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be (a) personally
delivered; (b) sent by email transmission; (c) sent by registered or certified
U.S. mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid; or (d) sent by

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

2.1. Shelf Registration.

(a) Filing. On a date that is no later than thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the Initial Lock-up Period, the Company shall file with the SEC
a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale by the Holders
from time to time of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders and,
as promptly as practicable thereafter, shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act at or prior to the expiration of the Initial Lock-up Period.
The Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for the resale pursuant to any
method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the
Holders of any and all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement. As soon as practicable following the date that the Shelf
Registration Statement becomes effective, but in any event within two (2)
Business Days of such date, the Company shall provide the Holders with written
notice of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

(b) Continued Effectiveness. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the
Securities Act in order to permit the Prospectus forming a part thereof to be
usable by Holders until the earlier of (i) the date as of which all
Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement or another registration statement filed under the Securities Act
(but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(3) of
the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) and (ii) the date as of which each
of the Holders is permitted to sell all of its Registrable Securities without
Registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without any time,
manner or volume limitations or other restrictions on transfer thereunder
(such period of effectiveness, the "Shelf Period"). Subject to Section
2.01(c), the Company shall not voluntarily take any action or omit to take any
action that would result in Holders of Registrable Securities covered thereby
not being able to offer and sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Shelf Registration Statement during the Shelf Period, unless such action or
omission is required by applicable law.

(c) Suspension of Registration. At any time that the Shelf Registration
Statement is effective and the Holders have a current intention to effect an
offering of all or part of its Registrable Securities included in the Shelf
Registration Statement, the Holders shall deliver a written notice to the
Company stating such intention at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
commencement of such offering. If the continued use of such Shelf Registration
Statement at such time would (i) materially interfere with a significant
acquisition, corporate organization, financing, securities offering or other
similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) render the Company unable to
comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, (iii)
require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or (iv) in



5 

the good faith determination of the Company, have a material adverse effect on
the Company, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action
to the Holders, suspend use of the Shelf Registration Statement (a "Shelf
Suspension"); provided that the Company shall not be permitted to exercise a
Shelf Suspension (i) for a period exceeding sixty (60) continuous days or (ii)
in excess of one-hundred twenty (120) days in any calendar year. In the case
of a Shelf Suspension, the Holders agree to immediately suspend use of the
applicable Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to
sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred
to above. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders upon the
termination of any Shelf Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus
(including through the filing of a current report on Form 8‑K), if necessary,
so it does not contain any untrue statement or omission and furnish to the
Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented
as the Holders may reasonably request. The Company will, if necessary,
supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement if required
by the registration form used by the Company for the Shelf Registration or by
the instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act
or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be
requested by the Holders.

(d) Underwritten Offering. During at any time a Holder so elects in connection
with an offering with estimated gross proceeds of at least $75,000,000, an
offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, and the Company
shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement for such purpose,
provided, however, that the Company will have no obligation to participate in
more than one (1) Underwritten Offerings relating to the sale of Registrable
Securities. The Company shall select the managing underwriter or underwriters
to administer such offering, subject to the consent of the Holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering (which consent shall not be unreasonably be withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

2.2. Piggyback Registration.

(a) Participation. After the expiration of the Initial Lock-up Period, if the
Company proposes to file (i) a Registration Statement or (ii) a prospectus
supplement to an effective shelf registration statement and Holders may be
included in the offering to which such prospectus supplement relates without
the filing of a post-effective amendment to such shelf registration statement,
with respect to any offering of its equity securities for cash for its own
account or for the account of any other Persons (other than (A) a Registration
on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such Forms or (B) a Registration
of securities solely relating to an offering and sale to employees or
directors of the Company pursuant to any employee stock plan or other employee
benefit plan arrangement) (a "Company Public Sale"), then, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than fifteen (15) days prior to
such filing), the Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to
the Holders, and such notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to
Register under such Registration Statement such number of Registrable
Securities as each such Holder may request in writing, subject to the
restrictions on Transfer contained in Article III (a



6 

"Piggyback Registration"). Subject to Section 2.01(b), the Company shall
include in such Registration Statement all such Registrable Securities that
are requested to be included therein within fifteen (15) days after the
receipt by such Holders of any such notice; provided that if at any time after
giving written notice of its intention to Register any securities and prior to
the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such
Registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to Register or to
delay Registration of such securities, the Company shall give written notice
of such determination to each Holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a
determination not to Register, shall be relieved of its obligation to Register
any Registrable Securities in connection with such Registration, and (ii) in
the case of a determination to delay Registering, shall be permitted to delay
Registering any Registrable Securities, for the same period as the delay in
Registering such other securities. If the offering pursuant to such
Registration Statement is to be underwritten, then each Holder making a
request for a Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must,
and the Company shall make such arrangements with the managing underwriter or
underwriters so that each such Holder may, participate in such Underwritten
Offering. If the offering pursuant to such Registration Statement is to be on
any other basis, then each Holder making a request for a Piggyback
Registration pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must, and the Company shall make
such arrangements so that each such Holder may, participate in such offering
on such basis. Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of its
Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration. Any Holder may deliver
written notice (an "Opt-Out Notice") to the Company requesting that such
Holder not receive notice from the Company of any proposed Company Public
Sale; provided, however, that such Holder may later revoke any such Opt-Out
Notice in writing. Following receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from a Holder
(unless subsequently revoked), the Company shall not be required to deliver
any notice to such Holder pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) and such Holder
shall no longer be entitled to participate in Underwritten Offerings by the
Company pursuant to this Section 2.02(a).

(b) Priority of Piggyback Registration. If the managing underwriter or
underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities
included in a Piggyback Registration informs the Company and the Holders in
writing that, in its or their opinion, the number of securities which such
Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the
number which can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a
significant adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the
securities offered or the market for the securities offered, then the
securities to be included in such Registration shall be (i) first, 100% of the
securities proposed to be sold in such Registration by the Company proposes to
sell, and (ii) second, and only if all the securities referred to in clause
(i) have been included, the number of Registrable Securities that, in the
opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without
having such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated pro rata among
the Holders that have requested to participate in such Registration based on
the relative number of Registrable Securities then held by each such Holder
(provided that any securities thereby allocated to a Holder that exceed such
Holder's request shall be reallocated among the remaining requesting Holders
in like manner) and (iii) third, and only if all of the Registrable Securities



7 

referred to in clause (ii) have been included in such Registration, any other
securities eligible for inclusion in such Registration.

2.3. Black-out Periods. In the event of a Company Public Sale of the Company's
equity securities in an Underwritten Offering, the Holders, if requested by
the managing underwriter or underwriters in such Underwritten Offering, will
not effect any public sale or distribution of any securities (except, in each
case, as part of the applicable Registration, if permitted), or enter into any
swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any
of the economic consequences of ownership of such securities, that are the
same as or similar to those being Registered in connection with such Company
Public Sale, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for such securities, during the period beginning seven (7) days before and
ending ninety (90) days (or such period as may be required by the Company or
such managing underwriter or underwriters) after, the effective date of the
Registration Statement filed in connection with such Registration, to the
extent timely notified in writing by the Company or the managing underwriter
or underwriters; provided, however, such restrictions shall not apply to (a)
securities acquired in open market transactions and (b) transfers to
Affiliates but only if such Affiliates agree to be bound by the restrictions
herein. Each Holder must execute and deliver such other agreements as may be
reasonably requested by the Company or the managing underwriter or
underwriters that are consistent with the foregoing or that are necessary to
give further effect thereto.

2.4. Registration Procedures.

(a) In connection with the Company's Registration obligations under Sections
2.01 and 2.02, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect

representations and warranties of the Company in any applicable underwriting
agreement cease to be true and correct in all material respects, and (E) of

fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such Prospectus
and any preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary

(x) on or prior to the date on which the applicable Registration Statement is
declared effective, use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify,
and cooperate with the Participating Holders, the managing underwriter or

Registration Statement as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to

gaining access to information regarding the Company pursuant to this Section
2.04(a)(xiv) shall agree to hold in strict confidence and shall not make any

(xvii) if reasonably requested by Holders Counsel, (i) promptly incorporate in
a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement such information as the Company reasonably agrees (upon advice of
counsel) is required to be included therein and (ii) make all required filings
of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment promptly after
the Company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated in
such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment and has agreed to their
inclusion in the Registration Statement.

(b) The Company may require each Participating Holder to furnish to the
Company such information regarding the distribution of such securities and
such other information relating to such Holder and its ownership of
Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request
in writing. Each Participating Holder agrees to furnish such information to
the Company and to cooperate with the Company as reasonably necessary to
enable the Company to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.

(c) Each Participating Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section

contemplated by Section 2.04(a)(vi), or until such Holder is advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and if
so directed by the Company, such Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the
Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such

such notice to and including the date when each seller of Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement either receives the copies
of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 2.04(a)(vi)
or is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be
resumed.

(d) Each Participating Holder shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
notify the Company, at any time when a Prospectus is required to be delivered
(or deemed delivered) under the Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event,
of which such Participating Holder has knowledge, relating to such
Participating Holder or its sale of Registrable Securities thereunder
requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus so
that, as thereafter delivered (or deemed delivered) to the purchasers of such
Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement
of a



12 

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading.

2.5. Underwritten Offerings.

(a) Shelf Registration. If requested by the underwriters for any Underwritten
Offering, the Company shall enter into an underwriting agreement with such
underwriters for such offering, such agreement to be reasonably satisfactory
in substance and form to the Company, the Holders participating in such
Underwritten Offering and the underwriters, and to contain such
representations and warranties by the Company and such other terms as are
generally prevailing in agreements of that type. The Participating Holders
shall cooperate with the Company in the negotiation of such underwriting
agreement and shall give consideration to the reasonable suggestions of the
Company regarding the form thereof. Such Holders shall be parties to such
underwriting agreement, which underwriting agreement shall (i) contain such
representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of,
the Company to and for the benefit of such Holders as are customarily made by
issuers to selling stockholders in secondary underwritten public offerings and
(ii) provide that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of
such underwriters under such underwriting agreement also shall be conditions
precedent to the obligations of such Holders.

(b) Piggyback Registrations. If the Company proposes to register any of its
securities under the Securities Act as contemplated by Section 2.02 and such
securities are to be distributed in an Underwritten Offering through one or
more underwriters, the Company shall, if requested by any Holder pursuant to
Section 2.02 and subject to the provisions of Section 2.02(b), use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for such underwriters to include on
the same terms and conditions that apply to the other sellers in such
Registration all the Registrable Securities to be offered and sold by such
Holder among the securities of the Company to be distributed by such
underwriters in such Registration. The Participating Holders shall be parties
to the underwriting agreement between the Company and such underwriters, which
underwriting agreement shall (i) contain such representations and warranties
by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the
benefit of such Holders as are customarily made by issuers to selling
stockholders in secondary underwritten public offerings and (ii) provide that
any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters
under such underwriting agreement also shall be conditions precedent to the
obligations of such Holders.

(c) Participation in Underwritten Registrations. Subject to provisions of
Section 2.05(a) and (b), no Person may participate in any Underwritten
Offering hereunder unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Person's
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Persons entitled to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, lock-up agreements,
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements.



13 

(d) Price and Underwriting Discounts. In the case of an Underwritten Offering
under Section 2.01, the price, underwriting discount and other financial terms
for the Registrable Securities shall be determined by the Holder(s) selling
Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration Statement. In addition, in
the case of any Underwritten Offering, each of the Holders may withdraw their
request to participate in the registration pursuant to Section 2.01 or 2.02
after being advised of such price, discount and other terms and shall not be
required to enter into any agreements or documentation that would require
otherwise; provided if any Holder enters into any such agreement requiring
otherwise, the Holder shall be deemed to have waived this provision. Any such
withdrawal pursuant to the foregoing sentence must be made up to and including
the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering to be effective; and such
withdrawal shall count as the one Underwritten Offering hereunder for purposes
of Section 2.01(d).

2.6. Registration Expenses. All customary expenses incident to the Company's
performance of or compliance with its obligations under this Agreement in
connection with the registration and disposition of Registrable Securities
shall be paid by the Company, including (i) all registration and filing fees,
and any other fees and expenses associated with filings required to be made
with the SEC or the FINRA, (ii) all fees and expenses in connection with
compliance with any securities or "Blue Sky" laws, (iii) all printing,
duplicating, word processing, messenger, telephone, facsimile and delivery
expenses (including expenses of printing certificates for the Registrable
Securities in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company
and of printing prospectuses), (iv) all fees and disbursements of counsel for
the Company and of all independent certified public accountants of the Company
(including the expenses of any special audit and cold comfort letters required
by or incident to such performance), (v) Securities Act liability insurance or
similar insurance if the Company so desires or the underwriters so require in
accordance with then-customary underwriting practice, (vi) all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the Registrable Securities
on any securities exchange or quotation of the Registrable Securities on any

special experts or other Persons retained by the Company in connection with
any Registration, (ix) all out-of-pocket expenses related to any "road-show"
for one Underwritten Offering, including all travel, meals and lodging, and
(x) all of the Company's internal expenses (including all salaries and
expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties);
but excluding all fees and disbursements of legal counsel for each Holder
selling Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration Statement, any
fees and disbursements of underwriters customarily paid by issuers or sellers
of securities, all out-of-pocket expenses related to any "road-show" for any
other Underwritten Offering , including all travel, meals and lodging, and
underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any,
attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities. All expenses relating to
the offer and sale of Registrable Securities not to be borne by the Company
pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be borne and paid by the Holders of
such Registrable Securities, in proportion to the number of Registrable
Securities included in such registration for each such holder.



14 

2.7. Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each Holder, each of their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders, employees, advisors,
and agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act) such Persons and each of their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, penalties, judgments,
suits, costs, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several
(including reasonable costs of investigation and legal expenses) (each, a
"Loss" and collectively "Losses"), as incurred, arising out of or based upon
(i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were Registered
under the Securities Act (including any final, preliminary or summary
Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or
any documents incorporated by reference therein), (ii) any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading or (iii) any actions or inactions or proceedings in
respect of the foregoing whether or not such indemnified party is a party
thereto; provided, that the Company shall not be liable to any particular
indemnified party (A) to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in any such Registration Statement or other document in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by such indemnified party for use in the preparation thereof or (B) to
the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or omission in a preliminary Prospectus relating to Registrable
Securities, if a Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) that would have
cured the defect was furnished to the indemnified party from whom the Person
asserting the claim giving rise to such Loss purchased Registrable Securities
at least five (5) days prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the
Registrable Securities to such Person and a copy of such Prospectus (as
amended and supplemented) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such
indemnified party to such Person at or prior to the written confirmation of
the sale of the Registrable Securities to such Person. This indemnity shall be
in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have. The Company shall
also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar
securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their
officers and directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the
meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of the indemnified parties.

(b) Indemnification by the Participating Holders. Each Participating Holder
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
the Company, its directors and officers and each Person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) from
and against any Losses resulting from (i) any untrue statement of a material
fact in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities
were Registered under the Securities Act (including any final, preliminary or
summary Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or



15 

supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein), or
(ii) any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, in each case, to the extent, but only to
the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any
information furnished in writing by such Holder to the Company specifically
for inclusion in such Registration Statement and has not been corrected in a
subsequent writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the Registrable
Securities to the Person asserting the claim. In no event shall the liability
of such Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
net proceeds received by such Holder under the sale of Registrable Securities
giving rise to such indemnification obligation. The Company shall be entitled
to receive indemnities from underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and
similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution,
to the same extent as provided above (with appropriate modification) with
respect to information furnished in writing by such Persons specifically for
inclusion in any Prospectus or Registration Statement.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
(provided that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall
relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder only to the
extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially prejudiced by reason of
such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the
defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party; provided that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
the expense of such Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in
writing to pay such fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have
failed to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after
receipt of notice of such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (C) the
indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based upon advice of its counsel)
that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties
that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying
party, or (D) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person (based upon advice
of its counsel) a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the
indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person
notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying
party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf
of such Person, but shall always be permitted to participate in such defense).
If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to settle such action without the consent of the
indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to
such claim or litigation without the prior written consent of such indemnified
party (such consent to not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If such
defense is not assumed by the



16 

indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent, but such
consent may not be unreasonably withheld. It is understood that the
indemnifying party or parties shall not, except as specifically set forth in
this Section 2.07(c), in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings
in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements or
other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such
jurisdiction at any one time unless (x) the employment of more than one
counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties,
(y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on the advice of
counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified parties or (z)
a conflict or potential conflict exists or may exist (based upon advice of
counsel to an indemnified party) between such indemnified party and the other
indemnified parties, in each of which cases the indemnifying party shall be
obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel
or counsels.

(d) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in
subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 2.07 is unavailable to an indemnified
party or insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to therein, then the
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as a result of such Loss (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one
hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with
the acts, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. In connection with any Registration
Statement filed with the SEC by the Company, the relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 2.07(d) were determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 2.07(d).
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to
in Section 2.07(a) and 2.07(b) shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.07(d),
in connection with any Registration Statement filed by the Company, a
Participating Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder under the
sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution obligation
less any amounts paid by such Holder pursuant to Section 2.07(b). If
indemnification is available under this Section 2.07, the indemnifying parties
shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in Section
2.07(a) and 2.07(b) without regard to the provisions of



17 

this Section 2.07(d). The remedies provided for in this Section 2.07 are not
exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

2.8. Rule 144. The Company covenants that it will file the reports required to
be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required
to file such reports, it will, upon the reasonable request of the Holders,
make publicly available such necessary information for so long as necessary to
permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act), and it will take
such further action as the Holders may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable the Holders to sell Registrable
Securities following the Initial Lock-Up Period without Registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule
144 under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time,
or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the
reasonable request of a Holder, the Company will deliver to such Holder a
written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements and, if
not, the specifics thereof.

3. 

TRANSFER OF SHARES

3.1. Restriction on Transfer.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, Sonic agrees that, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Sonic will not directly or indirectly Transfer
all or any part of the Shares or any right or economic interest pertaining
thereto, including the right to vote or consent on any matter or to receive or
have any economic interest in distributions or advances from the Company
pursuant thereto (the "Lock-up Restriction"); provided, however, that the
Lock-up Restriction shall not apply with respect to any Transfer to any
Affiliate of Sonic that is not a portfolio company of Sonic, provided that
such Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by the restrictions in this
Agreement applicable to Sonic, and Sonic will continue to be bound by the
restrictions in this Agreement applicable to Sonic notwithstanding such
Transfer.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Lock-Up Restriction
shall cease to apply to the Shares as follows:

(i) on and after the expiration of the Initial Lock-up Period until the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the date hereof, Sonic may Transfer up to a
number of Shares equal to one-third (1/3) of the total number of Shares
(provided that all Shares deposited in the General Escrow Account on the
Closing Date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement (as such terms
are defined therein) shall be included in the number of Shares for the purpose
of this clause (i));

(ii) on and after the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the date hereof,
Sonic may Transfer up to a number of Shares equal to (A) two-thirds (2/3) of



18 

the total number of Shares (provided that all Shares deposited in the General
Escrow Account on the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase
Agreement shall be included in the number of Shares for the purpose of this
clause (ii)), minus (B) the number of Shares Transferred pursuant to Section
3.01(b)(i) as of such date, if any; and

(iii) on and after the two (2) year anniversary of the date hereof, the Lock-
Up Restrictions shall no longer apply, and Sonic may Transfer any or all of
the Shares.

(c) Subject to the additional restrictions set forth in Section 4.02, the
Lock-Up Restriction shall not apply to (i) Common Stock, and any securities
then convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, acquired in open
market transactions, (ii) entering into a customary voting or support
agreement (with or without granting a proxy) in connection with any merger,
consolidation or other business combination of the Company, whether
effectuated through one transaction or series of related transactions
(including a tender offer followed by a merger in which holders of Common
Stock receive the same consideration per share paid in the tender offer) (a
"Business Combination"), or (iii) any Transfer pursuant to any Business
Combination.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, under no circumstances
shall any Holder, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly
or indirectly Transfer all or any part of its Shares or any right or economic
interest pertaining thereto, including the right to vote or consent on any
matter or to receive or have any economic interest in distributions or
advances from the Company pursuant thereto, to any Person or group of Persons
who, based on the reasonable inquiry of the Holder (including the obtainment
of representations and warranties from such Person or group of Persons), is or
would be, as a result of the proposed Transfer or a series of transactions
involving Common Stock (including the proposed Transfer), required under
Section 13(d)of the Exchange Act to file a Schedule 13D with the SEC with
respect to the Company upon such Person or group of Persons acquiring an
ownership stake (whether direct or beneficial) in the Company that equals or
exceeds 5% the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock; provided, however,
that this restriction shall not apply to any Transfer of the Shares (i) in an
open market transaction conducted through a market maker where the
identity(ies) of the ultimate buyer(s) is not known or disclosed to the
Holder, (ii) pursuant to an Underwritten Offering or (iii) to an Affiliate of
such Holder.

3.2. Organizational Documents. Without the prior written consent of Sonic, the
Company shall not amend its certificate of incorporation or bylaws as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement in a manner intended to, or that would
reasonably be expected to, (a) add or alter any restrictions to the
transferability of the Shares applicable to Sonic, its Affiliates or any of
their respective transferees, other than such restrictions provided for
herein, the certificate of incorporation of the Company as of the Closing
Date, applicable securities laws or restrictions adopted by the Company that
are generally applicable to all holders of Common Stock, (b) nullify any of
the rights of Sonic, its Affiliates or any of their respective transferees
that are provided for



19 

in this Agreement or (c) otherwise have an adverse effect on Sonic, its
Affiliates or any of their respective transferees in a materially
disproportionate manner relative to other stockholders.

4. 

BOARD REPRESENTATION; STANDSTILL

4.1. Sonic Board Representation.

(a) Effective as the date hereof, the Company shall have increased the size of
the Board of Directors to no fewer than ten (10) and no more than eleven (11)
directors and shall have caused Frank Baker and Dan Moloney to be appointed as
members of the Board of Directors, with terms expiring at the 201[8] annual
meeting of stockholders of the Company. Following the date hereof, the Company
will continue to nominate, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be elected (or appointed, as applicable), representatives selected by Sonic
(each a "Sonic Director") to serve on the Board of Directors, with the number
of such representatives being determined in accordance with the table provided
below based on the size of the Board of Directors and Sonic's and its
Affiliates' aggregate ownership percentage of shares of issued and outstanding
Common Stock (the "Sonic Percentage Ownership") calculated by dividing (i) the
number of shares of Common Stock actually and directly held with full voting
and investment power (including Common Stock held in book-entry form in a
brokerage or similar account owned by Sonic or its Affiliates) by Sonic and
its Affiliates by (ii) the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding as of the date hereof plus (B) the number of shares of Common
Stock that the Company has issued after the date hereof as a result of the
issuance of New Securities (as defined in Section 5.01) under circumstances in
which the Holders had the right to participate in the offering of such New
Securities pursuant to Section 5.01 (in each case subject to adjustments for
stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalization transactions affecting the
Common Stock after the date hereof). For the avoidance of doubt, except by
virtue of the operation of the foregoing clause (ii)(B), (x) the Sonic
Percentage Ownership shall not be impacted by dilutive issuances of Common
Stock or other securities of the Company, and (y) the number of Sonic
Directors may only be reduced upon the Transfer of Shares by Sonic or its
Affiliates (other than Transfers to Sonic and its Affiliates), including the
distribution of Shares to the Company from the General Escrow Account pursuant
to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, that results in the Sonic Percentage
Ownership falling below the applicable levels set forth in the table below.
Sonic shall use its reasonable best efforts keep the Company regularly
apprised of the Sonic Percentage Ownership, to the extent that such position
materially differs from the ownership positions that Sonic last reported
publicly on Sonic's Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D, as applicable, filed with
the SEC with respect to the Common Stock and shall promptly provide written
certification to the Company of the Sonic Percentage Ownership at the request
of the Company, which the Company may request no more than once during a
calendar year.

(b) The identification of any Sonic Director to be nominated or appointed by
the Board of Directors shall be subject to the prior approval of the Company,
provided, however, that the nomination or appointment of Frank Baker, Dan
Moloney, Peter Berger or Jeff Hendren as Sonic Directors in accordance with
Section 4.01(a) is hereby pre-approved by the Company. In addition, prior to
the appointment or election of any Sonic Director to the Board of Directors,
such Sonic Director must agree in writing to resign from the Board of
Directors under the circumstances contemplated by Section 7.3 of the Purchase
Agreement or by Section 4.01(k).

(c) Sonic acknowledges that, as members of the Board of Directors, the Sonic
Directors shall be obligated to comply with all policies, procedures,
processes, codes, rules, standards and guidelines applicable to members of the
Board of Directors (as each may be amended from time to time for all
directors).

(d) The Company agrees to include in the slate of nominees recommended by the
Board of Directors those persons designated by Sonic in accordance with
Section 4.01(a) and approved by the Company in accordance with Section
4.01(b), and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the election or
appointment (as applicable) of each such designee to the Board of Directors
(whether at a meeting of the Company's stockholders or otherwise), subject to
applicable law.

(e) In the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death,
disability, retirement, resignation or removal of any Sonic Director, the
Company agrees, subject to Section 4.01(b), to cause the vacancy created
thereby to be filled as promptly as practicable by a new designee of Sonic
following receipt of written notification from Sonic naming a new designee.

(f) Each Sonic Director shall be entitled to compensation, reimbursement of
out of pocket expenses, indemnification and insurance coverage in connection
with his or her role as a director to the same extent as other directors on
the Board of Directors. The Company shall notify the Sonic Directors of all
regular meetings and special meetings of the Board of Directors and of all
regular and special meetings of any committee of the Board of Directors on
which such Sonic Directors serve. The Company shall provide the Sonic
Directors with copies of all notices, minutes, consents and other materials
that are provided to other members of the Board of Directors at the same time
such materials are provided to the other members.



21 

(g) The Company acknowledges that the Sonic Directors may have certain rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by Sonic
and/or its respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Sonic Indemnitors"). The
Company hereby agrees that, with respect to a claim by a Sonic Director for
indemnification arising out his or her service as a director of the Company,
the Company is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to each
Sonic Director with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or
insurance (which obligations are and shall be the same as such obligations the
Company owes to other members of the Board of Directors) are primary and any
obligation of the Sonic Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the Sonic
Director are secondary) and (ii) the Sonic Indemnitors shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to all of the rights of recovery of the
Sonic Directors against the Company for such indemnity, advancement or
insurance proceeds.

(h) If at any time the size of the Board of Directors exceeds eleven (11)
directors, then the number of Sonic Directors shall be increased if, and then
only to the extent, necessary so that Sonic and its Affiliates maintain, as
nearly as possible, the proportionate representation on the Board of Directors
reflected in the table provided above based on the size of the Board of
Directors and the Sonic Percentage Ownership.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Company's Confidential
Information disclosure policies, the Sonic Directors shall be permitted to
disclose any Confidential Information of the Company to the partners, chief
financial officer, general counsel and principal of Siris Capital so long as
Siris Capital has agreed to be bound by and executed a confidentiality
agreement prescribed by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Sonic that
names such persons, limits disclosure of Confidential Information to such
persons and provides that Sonic will be responsible for a failure of such
persons to comply with obligations concerning confidentiality.

(j) Sonic will provide the Company, in writing, with the information about the
Sonic Directors that is required by applicable law or is otherwise necessary
for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials for meetings of stockholders
promptly after the Company requests such information from Sonic and will cause
the Sonic Directors to submit on a timely basis to the Company a completed and
executed questionnaire in the form that the Company provides to its outside
directors generally.

(k) Promptly upon any change in the Sonic Percentage Ownership that results in
the number of Sonic Directors then serving on the Board of Directors to exceed
the number of Sonic Directors that the Company would be required to nominate
pursuant to Section 4.01(a) if the nomination of directors occurred
immediately after the change in the Sonic Percentage Ownership, Sonic shall
cause one or more, as applicable, Sonic Directors to promptly resign from the
Board of Directors such that, after such resignation(s), the number of Sonic
Directors serving on the Board of Directors equals the number of Sonic
Directors that the Company would be required to nominate to the Board of
Directors pursuant to Section 4.01(a).



22 

(l) The rights of Sonic under this Section 4.01 (i) are personal to Sonic and
its Affiliates and are non-assignable to any Person that is not an Affiliate
of Sonic, including assignment through a direct or indirect change of control,
and (ii) will automatically terminate at the earlier of (A) such time that the
Sonic Percentage Ownership falls below the level required for the Company to
be obligated to nominate or appoint one (1) Sonic Director, (B) such time that
a holder of these rights is no longer an Affiliate of Sonic or (C) such time
that the Sonic Directors resign from the Board of Directors to permit Sonic
and/or an Affiliate of Sonic to participate in a third party tender offer or
acquisition proposal pursuant to Section 4.02(c).

4.2. Standstill.

(a) From the date of this Agreement and continuing until the three (3) year
anniversary of the date hereof and for such period thereafter as a Sonic
Director serves on the Board of Directors (the "Standstill Period"), except as
pre-approved in writing by the Board of Directors, Sonic and its Affiliates
will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly:

(i) (A) acquire any additional shares of Common Stock, including through the
acquisition of Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock, (B) make, initiate or,
subject Section 4.02(c), participate in any tender offer or exchange offer for
the Common Stock or any acquisition proposal (whether by merger, business
combination, recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or
other extraordinary transaction) involving the Company or its subsidiaries and
not recommended by the Board of Directors, (C) seek to demand, request to
demand, demand or join in any demand for a meeting of the Company's
stockholders, (D) nominate a director for election to the Board of Directors
through any "proxy access" procedure, (E) make, initiate or participate in any
"solicitation" of "proxies" (as those terms are used in the proxy rules of the
SEC promulgated pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act) in opposition to
the Board of Directors (for the avoidance of doubt, voting for the nominees
selected by the Board of Directors shall not be deemed a solicitation of
proxies), (F) fail to vote the Common Stock then held by Sonic or its
Affiliates in favor of the nominees chosen by the Board of Directors, or (G)
disclose any intention inconsistent with any of the foregoing; provided that,
with respect to clause (F), the prohibitions on Sonic and its Affiliates
contained therein shall only apply if and to the extent that the Company is,
at the time of voting, in compliance with its obligations (if any) with
respect to the nomination of Sonic Directors;

(ii) form, join or participate in a "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder), other than a group
involving Sonic and its Affiliates, pooling agreement, syndicate or voting
trust with respect to the matters described in Section 4.02(a)(i), or
otherwise act in concert with another stockholder of the Company with respect
to the matters described in Section 4.02(a)(i);



23 

(iii) act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control the management,
the Board of Directors or policies of the Company;

(iv) seek to remove or support anyone else in seeking to remove, without
cause, any member of the Board of Directors (other than a Sonic Director), or
encourage any other Person to do so;

(v) agree or offer to take, or encourage or propose (publicly or otherwise)
the taking of, assist, induce or encourage any other Person to take, or enter
into discussions with any third party with respect to the taking of, any
action referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.02(a)
(subject to the limitations stated therein); or

(vi) other than in connection with enforcement of Sonic's rights under this
Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and the other agreements contemplated
thereby, otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to knowingly and
directly encourage, facilitate, incite, or seek to cause others to instigate
legal proceedings against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors, or employees.

(b) During the Standstill Period, neither the Company nor Sonic and its
Affiliates shall make or issue or cause to be made or issued any disclosure,
announcement, or statement (including any disclosure to any journalist, member
of the media, or securities analyst) concerning the other party, in each case
which disparages such other party or any of such other party's directors,
director nominees, officers, members, employees, advisors or other affiliates;
provided that nothing in this Section 4.02(b) shall preclude any Person from
making or issuing, or causing to be made or issued, any disclosure,
announcement or statement (i) that such Person determines in good faith is
required by applicable law, rule or regulation, or (ii) in connection with a
governmental investigation, audit or inquiry, legal process or any dispute
involving the parties to this Agreement.

(c) During the Standstill Period, Sonic and its Affiliates may participate in
a tender offer or exchange offer for Common Stock or any acquisition proposal
(whether by merger, business combination, recapitalization, restructuring,
liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction) involving the
Company or its subsidiaries and not recommended by the Board of Directors,
provided, that, prior to such participation, all then-serving Sonic Directors
must resign from the Board of Directors. From and after such resignation(s),
the Company shall have no continuing obligations regarding the nomination or
appointment of Sonic Directors pursuant to Section 4.01.

(d) During the Standstill Period, Sonic and its Affiliates, whether directly
or indirectly through any third-party intermediaries, shall not, publicly or
privately, request that the Company or the Board of Directors waive,
terminate, or amend the provisions of this Section 4.02.



24 

(e) All of the Shares are subject to this Section 4.02. Any transferee of any
of the Shares shall acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this
Section 4.02 for the remainder of the Standstill Period, except where such
transferee acquires ownership of the Shares through a public offering that is
made in compliance with this Agreement pursuant to a Registration Statement.

(f) For the purposes of this Section 4.02, a Person shall be deemed the
"Beneficial Owner" of and shall be deemed to "Beneficially Own" any Common
Stock:

(i) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates beneficially owns
pursuant to Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act;

(ii) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates, directly or
indirectly, has (A) the right or the obligation to acquire (whether such right
is exercisable, or such obligation is required to be performed, immediately or
only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (written or oral and other than customary agreements with and
between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide
public offering of securities), or upon the exercise of conversion rights,
exchange rights, rights, warrants or options, or otherwise; or (B) the right
to vote such shares of Common Stock pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (written or oral);

(iii) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other
Person with which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates has any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (written or oral, but other than
customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members
with respect to a bona fide public offering of securities) for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any Common Stock of the Company; or

(iv) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by a counterparty
(or any of such counterparty's Affiliates) under any Derivatives Contract
(without regard to any short or similar position under the same or any other
Derivatives Contract) to which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates
is a Receiving Party; provided, however, that the number of Common Stock that
a Person is deemed to Beneficially Own pursuant to this clause (iv) in
connection with a particular Derivatives Contract shall not exceed the number
of Notional Common Stock with respect to such Derivatives Contract; provided,
further, that the number of Common Stock beneficially owned by each
counterparty (including its Affiliates) under a Derivatives Contract shall for
purposes of this clause (iv) be deemed to include all Common Stock that are
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other counterparty (or any
of such other counterparty's Affiliates) under any Derivatives Contract to
which such first counterparty (or any of such first counterparty's Affiliates)
is a Receiving Party, with this proviso being applied to successive
counterparties as appropriate.



25 

(g) For the purposes of this Section 4.02 "Derivatives Contract" means a
contract between two parties (the "Receiving Party" and the "Counterparty")
that is designed to produce economic benefits and risks to the Receiving Party
that correspond substantially to the ownership by the Receiving Party of a
number of shares of Common Stock specified or referenced in such contract (the
number corresponding to such economic benefits and risks, the "Notional Common
Stock"), regardless of whether obligations under such contract are required or
permitted to be settled through the delivery of cash, Common Stock or other
property, without regard to any short position under the same or any other
similar contract.

5. 

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

5.1. Right to Purchase New Securities. For so long as Sonic's percentage
ownership interest in the Company (calculated by dividing (i) the number of
shares of Common Stock actually and directly held with full voting and
investment power (including Common Stock held in book-entry form in a
brokerage or similar account owned by Sonic or its Affiliates) by Sonic and
its Affiliates by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of
the applicable calculation date) is equal to five percent (5%) or greater, the
Company hereby grants to each Holder the right to purchase any or all of such
Holder's Preemptive Share Percentage (as defined below) of all New Securities
(as defined below) that the Company may, from time to time, propose to issue
and sell at the cash price and on the terms on which the Company proposes to
sell such New Securities; provided that such right shall apply only with
respect to proposed issuances that meet each of the following requirements:
(i) the New Securities are to be issued at a cash price per share (or implied
cash price per share based on conversion, exercise or similar rights, as
applicable, that are offered for cash) of Common Stock that is less than
$56.961 (subject to adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and
recapitalization transactions affecting the Common Stock after the date
hereof) and (ii) the total number of New Securities proposed to be issued
exceeds one percent (1%) of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common
Stock. A Holder's "Preemptive Share Percentage" shall be equal to a fraction
(a) the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock held by
such Holder on the date of the Company's written notice pursuant to Section
5.03 and (b) the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding on such date.

5.2. New Securities. "New Securities" shall mean any shares of Common Stock or
preferred stock of the Company, any rights, options or warrants to purchase
Common Stock or preferred stock and any other equity securities, derivative
securities or any securities whatsoever convertible into, exercisable or
exchangeable for capital stock of the Company; provided, however, that the
term New Securities shall not include (a) securities issued as part of
compensatory arrangements to employees, consultants or directors of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries whether or not pursuant to any management
equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit
plan or other equity compensation agreement; (b) securities issued pro rata to
existing security holders pursuant to any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other reclassification by the Company of any of its capital
stock; (c) securities issued



26 

to financiers in connection with transactions that are primarily debt
financing transactions to which the Company and an unaffiliated third party
may be a party and which are approved by the Board of Directors, including
securities issued pursuant to the exercise of warrants, rights, options or
other securities issued to financiers in connection therewith; (d) securities
issued as part of the sale of the Company, or in connection with the
acquisition by the Company of another Person or any assets thereof by merger,
purchase or otherwise; or (e) securities issued upon the conversion, exchange
or exercise of any securities that may be issued by the Company that provide
for the conversion or exchange into or exercise for such other securities if
and to the extent Sonic and its Affiliates were granted preemptive rights
pursuant to this Article V in connection with the initial issuance of such
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security.

5.3. Required Notices. In the event the Company proposes to undertake an
issuance of New Securities, it shall give Sonic prompt written notice of its
intention describing the number and type of New Securities proposed to be
issued, the cash price therefor, the expected date of issuance such New
Securities (which shall be at least thirty (30) days after the date of
delivery of such notice) and the general terms upon which the Company proposes
to issue the same. Sonic and its Affiliates shall have fifteen (15) days from
the date of receipt of any such notice to agree to purchase any or all of
Sonic's Preemptive Share Percentage of such New Securities at the price and
upon the general terms specified in the Company's notice, by Sonic delivering
written notice to the Company and stating therein the quantity of New
Securities to be purchased. Upon the issuance of any New Securities, the
Company shall issue to Sonic and/or its Affiliates (as applicable) such number
of New Securities as was designated in the written notice therefor delivered
to the Company in accordance with this Section 5.03, against payment in full
for such shares of New Securities.



5.4. Company's Right to Sell. In the event Sonic and its Affiliates fail to
exercise, within such fifteen (15) day period, the right to acquire its full
Preemptive Share Percentage of the New Securities offered, the Company shall
have sixty (60) days to sell or enter into an agreement to sell (pursuant to
which the sale of New Securities covered thereby shall be closed, if at all,
within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of such agreement) all such
New Securities for which such preemptive rights were not exercised, at a price
and upon terms not more favorable in any material respect to the purchasers
thereof as was specified in the Company's notice delivered pursuant to Section
5.03. In the event the Company has not (a) sold or issued, or entered into any
agreement to sell, all such New Securities within such sixty (60) day period
or (b) if the Company so entered into an agreement to sell all such New
Securities, sold and issued all such New Securities within one hundred twenty
(120) days from the date of such agreement, the Company shall not thereafter
issue or sell any New Securities without first again offering such securities
to Sonic and its Affiliates in the manner provided in this Article V.

6. 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



27 

6.1. Removal of Legends. Upon the written request of any Holder:

(a) The Company shall remove any restrictive legend included on the
certificates (or, in the case of book-entry shares, any other instrument or
record) representing such Holder's and/or its Affiliates' ownership of
securities of the Company, and the Company shall issue a certificate (or
evidence of the issuance of securities in book-entry form) without such
restrictive legend or any other restrictive legend to the holder of the
applicable securities upon which it is stamped, if (i) such securities are
registered for resale under the Securities Act, (ii) such securities are sold
or transferred pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) such Securities are eligible for

compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144(c)(1)
(or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable) as to such securities and without volume or
manner-of-sale restrictions. Following the earlier of (A) the effective date
of a Registration Statement described in Article II or (B) Rule 144 becoming

Company to be in compliance with the current public information required under
Rule 144(c)(1) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable) as to the Securities and
without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, the Company, upon the written
request of the Holder, shall instruct the Company's transfer agent to remove
the legend from the securities (in whatever form) and shall cause its counsel
to issue any legend removal opinion required by the transfer agent. Any fees
(with respect to the transfer agent, Company counsel, or otherwise) associated
with the issuance of such opinion or the removal of such legend shall be borne
by the Company. If a legend is no longer required pursuant to the foregoing,
the Company will no later than five (5) Business Days following the delivery
by any Holder or its Affiliate to the Company or the transfer agent (with
notice to the Company) of a legended certificate (if applicable) representing
such securities (endorsed or with stock powers attached, signatures
guaranteed, and otherwise in form necessary to affect the reissuance and/or
transfer) and a seller representation letter representing that such securities
may be sold pursuant to Rule 144, to the extent required, deliver or cause to
be delivered to the holder of such securities a certificate representing such
securities (or evidence of the issuance of securities in book-entry form) that
is free from all restrictive legends.

(b) The Company shall cooperate with and take reasonable action to facilitate,
in accordance with reasonable and customary business practices, any and all
Transfers for consideration or otherwise, whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, by any Holder or its
Affiliates of the Shares.

6.2. Freedom to Pursue Opportunities. Without limiting Section 7.3 of the
Purchase Agreement, the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that
notwithstanding any duty that may otherwise exist hereunder or at law or in
equity, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:

(a) Sonic, Sonic's Affiliates, any funds or accounts managed or beneficially
owned, directly or indirectly, by Sonic or any of its Affiliates, and any of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, trustees, employees,
partners, managers, members, stockholders, beneficiaries and agents (in each
case, other than any officer or employee of the Company or any of its



28 

Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of such Person) (the foregoing Persons in this
clause (a), the "Exempted Persons"), have the right to, and shall have no duty
(contractual, fiduciary or otherwise) not to, directly or indirectly engage in
any business, business activity or line of business, including those that are
the same or similar to those of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or may
be deemed to be competing with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and

(b) in the event that any Exempted Person acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or matter that may be a business opportunity for the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Exempted Person or any
other Person, on the other hand, such Exempted Person shall have no duty
(contractual, fiduciary or otherwise) to communicate or present such business
opportunity to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shall not be liable to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Affiliates or stockholders of any of the
foregoing for breach of any duty (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise) by
reason of the fact that such Exempted Person, directly or indirectly, pursues
or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another
Person, does not present such opportunity to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or otherwise; provided, however, that this clause (b) shall not
apply to any business opportunities that come to an Exempted Person's
attention solely as a result of such Exempted Person's (or their officers',
directors', trustees', employees', partners', managers', members',
stockholders', beneficiaries', affiliates' and agents', as and if applicable)
position as an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

6.3. Confidentiality. The Company acknowledges that in the ordinary course of
business, Sonic and its Affiliates pursue, acquire, manage and serve on the
boards of companies that may be competitors or potential competitors to the
Company and its Affiliates, and that their review of Confidential Information
of the Company will inevitably enhance their knowledge and understanding of
the Company and its industry in a way that cannot be separated from their
historical knowledge. Accordingly, the Company agrees that, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not restrict their
use of such knowledge and understanding, including in connection with the
purchase, sale, consideration and oversight of any other investments or
investment opportunities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sonic acknowledges
and agrees that the foregoing does not grant Sonic or its Affiliates,
including the Sonic Directors, any license under any patents, trademarks,
copyrights, or other intellectual property rights of the Company or any of its
Affiliates.

7. 
MISCELLANEOUS

7.1. Term; Release. This Agreement shall terminate upon the later of the
expiration of the Shelf Period and such time as there are no Registrable

this Article VII, which shall survive any such termination, and (b) the
provisions of Article III and Section 4.02, which shall terminate when Sonic
and its Affiliates cease to hold any Shares. In the event any Holder shall
Transfer all of the Shares held by such Holder in compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement such that neither such Holder nor any of its
Affiliates retains any interest in Shares of any kind, then such Holder shall



29 

cease to be a party to this Agreement and shall be relieved and have no
further liability arising hereunder for events occurring from and after the
date of such Transfer so long as the Holder was not in material breach of this
Agreement at the time of such Transfer.

7.2. Injunctive Relief. It is hereby agreed and acknowledged that it will be
impossible to measure in money the damage that would be suffered if the
parties fail to comply with any of the obligations herein imposed on them and
that in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved Person will be irreparably
damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at law. Any such Person shall,
therefore, be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled in law or in equity) to injunctive relief, including specific
performance, to enforce such obligations, and if any action should be brought
in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of the
parties hereto shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at
law.

7.3. Attorneys' Fees. In any action or proceeding brought to enforce any
provision of this Agreement or where any provision hereof is validly asserted
as a defense, the successful party shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition
to any other available remedy.

7.4. Amendment; Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any term, provision or
condition of this Agreement will be effective, unless in writing and executed
by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding Registrable Securities of such
Holders. No amendment, modification, supplement, discharge, or waiver hereof
or hereunder shall require the consent of any person not a party to this
Agreement. No waiver of any provision hereof shall be deemed a waiver of any
other provision nor shall any such waiver by any party be deemed a continuing
waiver of any matter. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder, or otherwise available in respect hereof at
law or in equity, shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any
other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power
or remedy.

7.5. Disclosure of Agreement. The parties may disclose the Agreement through
the Company's filing with the SEC of current report(s) on Form 8‑K attaching
the Agreement or describing the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement. Except as required by applicable SEC rules and regulations or New

5.[RESERVED.]



6.Suspension of Performance; Disbursement into Court. If, at any time, there

disposition of all or any portion of the Escrowed Property, then Escrow Agent
may, in its sole discretion, refrain and refuse to deliver or otherwise
dispose of funds or other property held pursuant to this Agreement or any part
thereof or to otherwise act hereunder, as stated above, unless and until:



(i) the rights of the parties hereto have been resolved pursuant to a Final
Order; or





(ii) the parties hereto deliver a Joint Instruction to Escrow Agent with
respect to such dispute or disagreement.



In the event of any dispute or disagreement, as described above, Escrow Agent
shall have the right, in addition to the rights above and at the election of
Escrow Agent to petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other
appropriate method) any court of competent jurisdiction, in any venue
convenient to Escrow Agent, for instructions with respect to such dispute or
disagreement and, to the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such
court, for holding and disposition in accordance with the instructions of such
court, all Escrowed Property, after deduction and payment to Escrow Agent of
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including court
costs and attorneys' fees, in each case, which are reasonable, documented and
out-of-pocket) payable to or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the
performance of its duties and the exercise of its rights hereunder.



Until receipt of a Final Order with respect to such dispute or disagreement,
Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Buyer, Seller or the Representatives,
their respective owners, shareholders or members or any other person with
respect to any such suspension of performance or disbursement into court,
specifically including any liability or claimed liability that may arise, or
be alleged to have arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the
disbursement of the Escrowed Property or any delay in or with respect to any
other action required or requested of Escrow Agent.



7.Investment of Special Escrow Funds and General Escrow Funds.



(a) Based upon Seller's and Buyer's prior review of investment alternatives,
in the absence of further specific written direction to the contrary, Escrow
Agent is directed to initially invest and reinvest each of the General Escrow
Funds and the Special Escrow Funds in the investment indicated on Schedule C
hereto. With the approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, Seller may provide written instructions changing the investment of
the General Escrow Funds or the Special Escrow Funds to Escrow Agent;
provided, however, that no investment or reinvestment instructions shall be
given except in the following: (a) direct obligations of the United States of
America or obligations the principal of and the interest on which are
unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America; (b) U.S. dollar
denominated deposit accounts and certificates of deposits issued by any bank,
bank and trust company, or national banking association (including Escrow
Agent and its affiliates), which such deposits are either (i) insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or a similar governmental agency, or
(ii) with domestic commercial banks which have a rating on their short- term
certificates of deposit on the date of purchase of "A-1" or "A-l+" by SandP or
"P-1" by Moody's and maturing no more than 360 days after the date of purchase
(ratings on holding companies are not considered as the rating of the bank);
(c) repurchase agreements with any bank, trust company, or national banking
association (including Escrow Agent and its affiliates); or (d) institutional
money market funds, including funds managed by Escrow Agent or any of its
affiliates; provided that Escrow Agent will not be directed to invest in
investments that Escrow Agent in its reasonable discretion determines are not
consistent with Escrow Agent's policy or practices. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge that Escrow Agent does not have a duty nor will it undertake any
duty to provide investment advice.





(b) If Escrow Agent has not received a Joint Written Direction from Buyer and
Seller at any time that an investment decision must be made, Escrow Agent is
directed to invest the General Escrow Funds, the Special Escrow Funds or such
portion thereof as to which no written investment instruction has been
received, in the investment indicated on Schedule C hereto. All investments
shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Escrow Agent may, without notice to Buyer and
Seller, sell or liquidate any of the foregoing investments at any time for any
disbursement of the General Escrow Funds or the Special Escrow Funds permitted
or required hereunder. All investment earnings of the General Escrow Funds
shall become part of the General Escrow Funds and investment losses of the
General Escrow Funds shall be charged against the General Escrow Funds. All
investment earnings of the Special Escrow Funds shall become part of the
Special Escrow Funds and investment losses of the Special Escrow Funds shall
be charged against the Special Escrow Funds. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in Section 11, Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for loss
in the value of any investment made pursuant to this Agreement, or for any
loss, cost or penalty resulting from any sale or liquidation of the General
Escrow Funds or the Special Escrow Funds. With respect to any General Escrow
Funds or Special Escrow Funds received by Escrow Agent after 12:00 p.m. New
York time the Escrow Agent shall not be required to invest such funds or to
effect any investment instruction until the next day upon which banks in New
York, NY and the New York Stock Exchange are open for business.



8.Voting Rights as a Stockholder. Escrow Agent will vote the Buyer Common
Stock held in the General Escrow Account in accordance with the written
instructions of Seller. 

9.Dividends and Other Distributions in Respect of the General Escrow Buyer
Stock. All dividends and other distributions payable with respect to the
General Escrow Buyer Stock shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to hold in
the General Escrow Account in accordance with the terms hereof. To the extent
Escrow Agent receives dividends and other distributions payable with respect
to the General Escrow Buyer Stock other than cash or shares of Buyer Common
Stock, the Escrow Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
convert such dividends or other distributions to cash.



10.Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent may resign and be
discharged from the performance of its duties hereunder at any time by giving
sixty (60) calendar days prior written notice to Buyer and Seller specifying a
date when such resignation shall take effect. Similarly, Escrow Agent may be
removed at any time by Buyer and Seller giving at least five (5) days' prior
written notice to Escrow Agent specifying the date when such removal shall
take effect. Buyer and Seller jointly shall appoint a successor Escrow Agent
hereunder prior to the effective date of such resignation or removal. If Buyer
and Seller fail to appoint a successor Escrow Agent within such time, Escrow
Agent shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor escrow agent, and all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees) related to such petition shall be
paid jointly and severally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand; provided that as between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, each of them shall be responsible for 50% of such costs and
expenses. The retiring Escrow Agent shall transmit all records pertaining to
the Escrowed Property and shall transfer the Escrowed Property to the
successor Escrow Agent, after making copies of such records as the retiring



Escrow Agent deems advisable and after deduction and payment to the retiring
Escrow Agent of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including court costs and attorneys' fees, in each case, which are
reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket) payable to or incurred by the
retiring Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and the
exercise of its rights hereunder. After any retiring Escrow Agent's
resignation or removal, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Escrow Agent under this Agreement.



11.Liability of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such
duties as are expressly set forth herein and no duties shall be implied, other
than the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Escrow Agent has no
fiduciary or discretionary duties of any kind. Escrow Agent's permissive
rights shall not be construed as duties. Escrow Agent shall have no liability
under and no duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than
this Agreement, including without limitation any other agreement between any
or all of the parties hereto or any other persons even though reference
thereto may be made herein and whether or not a copy of such agreement has
been provided to Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action
taken or omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction determines, which determination is not subject to
appeal, that Escrow Agent's bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or willful
misconduct was the cause of any loss to Buyer or Seller. Escrow Agent may
retain and act hereunder through agents, and shall not be responsible for or
have any liability with respect to the acts of any such agent retained by
Escrow Agent in good faith, except to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction determines, which determination is not subject to appeal, that
Escrow Agent's or such agent's bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or willful
misconduct was the cause of any loss to Buyer or Seller. Escrow Agent's sole
responsibility shall be for the safekeeping of the Escrowed Property in
accordance with Escrow Agent's customary practices and disbursement thereof in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to make any calculations under this
Agreement, or to determine when any calculation required under the provisions
of this Agreement should be made, how it should be made or what it should be,
or to confirm or verify any such calculation. Escrow Agent may rely upon any
notice, instruction, request or other instrument, not only as to its due
execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy
of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent believes in good
faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the person or
parties purporting to sign the same. In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable
for (a) acting in accordance with or conclusively relying upon any
instruction, notice, demand, certificate or document believed in good faith by
Escrow Agent to have been created by or on behalf of Buyer or Seller, or (b)
any amount greater than the value of (x) the aggregate amount of the Special
Escrow Funds and General Escrow Funds, as valued upon deposit with Escrow
Agent, plus (y) the General Escrow Buyer Stock, as valued based on the average
closing price of Buyer Common Stock for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading
Days prior to the date of deposit. Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for
delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control,
including without limitation acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of
war or terror, epidemics, governmental regulations, fire, communication line
failures, computer viruses, attacks or intrusions, power failures, earthquakes
or other disasters. Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal
action or commence any proceeding in connection with the Escrowed Property,
any account in which any of the Special Escrow Funds, General Escrow Funds or
the General Escrow Buyer Stock are deposited, this Agreement or the Underlying
Agreement or to appear in, prosecute or defend any



such legal action or proceeding or to take any other action that in Escrow
Agent's reasonable judgment may expose it to potential expense or liability.
Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in the event of any
dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions hereof or
of any other agreement or of its duties hereunder, or relating to any dispute
involving any party hereto and shall incur no liability and shall be fully
indemnified from any liability in acting in good faith and in accordance with
the advice of such counsel. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, jointly and severally, shall promptly pay, upon demand, the reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of any such counsel; provided
that as between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, each of
them shall be responsible for 50% of such fees and expenses. Buyer and Seller
agree to perform or procure the performance of all further acts and things,
and execute and deliver such further documents, as may be required by law or
as Escrow Agent may reasonably request in connection with its duties
hereunder.



Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with orders
issued or process entered by any court with respect to the Escrowed Property
which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it. If any
portion of the Escrowed Property is at any time attached, garnished or levied
upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any
court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered
by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then and in any such
event, Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and
comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by
legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it, without the need for appeal
or other action; and if Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ,
judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to
any other person or entity by reason of such compliance even though such
order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.



12.Indemnification of Escrow Agent. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, jointly and severally, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent and each director, officer,
employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent (each, an "Indemnified
Party") upon demand against any and all actions, claims, losses, damages,
liabilities, penalties, and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of any kind or nature (including without limitation attorneys' fees,
costs and expenses, in each case, which are reasonable, documented and out-of-
pocket) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties,
whether as a result of or arising from or in any way relating to any claim,
demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation)
threatened, asserted or initiated by any person or entity, including without
limitation Buyer, Seller and the Representatives, arising from or in
connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated herein,
whether or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to any such suit, action
or proceeding or the target of any such inquiry or investigation; provided,
however, that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified
hereunder for any liability to the extent finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, which determination is not subject to appeal, to have
been caused by the bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of
such Indemnified Party. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
further agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify each Indemnified Party for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, including without
limitation reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorney's fees, incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with the enforcement of Buyer's and
Seller's obligations hereunder. Each Indemnified Party shall,



in its sole discretion, have the right to select and employ one separate
counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or asserted against it,
and the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees of such counsel shall be
paid upon demand by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
jointly and severally. The obligations of Buyer and Seller under this Section
shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal
of Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 12,
as between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, each of them
shall be responsible for 50% of such costs and expenses.



Buyer and Seller agree that neither the payment by Buyer or Seller of any
claim by Escrow Agent for indemnification hereunder nor any disbursements to
Escrow Agent from the Escrowed Property in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent
for indemnification shall impair, limit, modify or affect, as between Buyer
and Seller, the respective rights and obligations of Buyer and Seller under
the Underlying Agreement.



13.Compensation and Reimbursement of Escrow Agent.



(a) Fees and Expenses. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
agree, jointly and severally, to compensate and reimburse Escrow Agent upon
demand in accordance with Schedule B hereto; provided that as between Buyer,
on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, each of them shall be
responsible for 50% of such amounts. The obligations of Buyer and Seller under
this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the
resignation or removal of Escrow Agent.



(b) Security and Offset. Buyer and Seller hereby grant to Escrow Agent and the
Indemnified Parties a first priority security interest in, lien upon and right
of offset against the Escrowed Property with respect to any compensation or
reimbursement due any of them hereunder (including any claim for
indemnification hereunder). Buyer and Seller shall promptly pay such amounts
to Escrow Agent or any Indemnified Party upon receipt of an itemized invoice.



14.Representations and Warranties. Buyer and Seller, severally and not
jointly, each respectively make the following representations and warranties
to Escrow Agent solely as to itself:



(a) it has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder; and this Agreement has been duly
approved by all necessary action and constitutes its valid and binding
agreement enforceable in accordance with its terms;



(b) each of the applicable persons designated on Schedule A hereto has been
duly appointed to act as its authorized representative hereunder and
individually has full power and authority on its behalf to execute and deliver
any Joint Written Direction, to amend, modify or waive any provision of this
Agreement and to take any and all other actions as its authorized
representative under this Agreement, all without further consent or direction
from, or notice to, it or any other person; and



(c) no change in designation of such authorized representatives shall be
effective until written notice of such change is delivered to each other party
to this Agreement pursuant to Section 16 and Escrow Agent has had reasonable
time to act upon it.





15.Identifying Information. To help the government fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business
entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, Escrow Agent requires
documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. Escrow
Agent may require financial statements, licenses or identification and
authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the
entity or other relevant documentation. Buyer and Seller agree to provide all
information requested by Escrow Agent in connection with any legislation or
regulation to which Escrow Agent is subject, in a timely manner.



16.Notices. All notices, approvals, consents, requests and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing (provided that any communication
sent to Escrow Agent hereunder must be in the form of a manually signed
document or electronic copy thereof), in English, and shall be delivered (a)
by personal delivery, or (b) by national overnight courier service, or (c) by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or (d) via facsimile
transmission, with confirmed receipt or (e) via email by way of a PDF
attachment thereto. Notice shall be effective upon receipt except for notice
via email, which shall be effective only when the recipient, by return email
or notice delivered by other method provided for in this Section, acknowledges
having received that email (with an automatic "read receipt" or similar notice
not constituting an acknowledgement of an email receipt for purposes of this
Section). Such notices shall be sent to the applicable party or parties at the

or to such other address as each party may designate for itself by like notice
and unless otherwise provided herein shall be deemed to have been given on the
date received. Buyer and Seller agree to assume all risks arising out of the
use of electronic methods to submit instructions and directions to Escrow
Agent, including without limitation the risk of Escrow Agent acting on
unauthorized instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third
parties.



17.Optional Security Procedures. In the event instructions, including funds
transfer instructions, address change or change in contact information are
given to Escrow Agent (other than in writing at the time of execution of this
Agreement), whether in writing, by facsimile or otherwise, Escrow Agent is
authorized but shall not be required to seek confirmation of such instructions
by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule A
hereto, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting
to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers
for call-backs may be changed only in writing actually received and
acknowledged by Escrow Agent and shall be effective only after Escrow Agent
has a reasonable opportunity to act on such changes. If Escrow Agent is unable
to contact any of the designated representatives identified in Schedule A
hereto, Escrow Agent is hereby authorized but shall be under no duty to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more



of Buyer's or Seller's executive officers, which shall include the titles of
Chief Executive Officer, President and Vice President, or any of the persons
that constitute a Seller Representative (collectively, the "Contact Persons"),
as Escrow Agent may select. Such Contact Persons shall deliver to Escrow Agent
a fully executed incumbency certificate, and Escrow Agent may rely in good
faith upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. Buyer
and Seller agree that Escrow Agent may at its option record any telephone
calls made pursuant to this Section. Escrow Agent in any funds transfer may
rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided
by any Buyer Representative or any Seller Representative to identify (a) the
beneficiary, (b) the beneficiary's bank, or (c) an intermediary bank. Escrow
Agent may apply any of the Escrowed Property for any payment order it executes
using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a person
other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank
other than the beneficiary's bank or an intermediary bank so designated. Buyer
and Seller acknowledge that these optional security procedures are
commercially reasonable.



18.Binding Effect; Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
respective parties hereto and their heirs, executors, successors or assigns.
If Escrow Agent consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business (including the escrow
contemplated by this Agreement) to another entity, the successor or transferee
entity without any further act shall be the successor Escrow Agent.



19.Amendment, Waiver and Assignment. None of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement may be changed, waived, modified, discharged, terminated or varied
in any manner whatsoever unless in writing duly signed by Escrow Agent, a
Buyer Representative and a Seller Representative. No course of conduct shall
constitute a waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
unless such waiver is specified in writing, and then only to the extent so
specified. A waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement on
one occasion shall not constitute a waiver of the other terms of this
Agreement, or of such terms and conditions on any other occasion. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may not be assigned by any
party without the written consent of Escrow Agent, the Buyer Representative
and the Seller Representative.



20.Severability. To the extent any provision of this Agreement is prohibited
by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.



21.Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof that would require the
application of any other laws.



22.Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue. Each party hereto stipulates that, if
there is any dispute or disagreement between or among any of the parties or
privies to this Agreement as to the interpretation of any provision of, or the
performance of obligations under, this Agreement (a "Dispute"), then the
Dispute may be commenced and prosecuted in its entirety in, and each party
hereto consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction and proper venue of, any
state or federal court having proper jurisdiction located in the State of
Delaware, and each party hereto consents to personal jurisdiction and venue in
such courts and waives and relinquishes all right to attack the suitability



or convenience of such venue or forum by reason of their present or future
domiciles, or by any other reason. The parties hereto acknowledge that all
directions issued by the forum court, including all injunctions and other
decrees, will be binding and enforceable in all jurisdictions and countries.



23.Entire Agreement, No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (and, solely
as to Buyer and Seller, the Underlying Agreement) constitutes the entire
agreement between the signatory parties hereto relating to (i) the holding,
investment and disbursement of the Special Escrow Funds and General Escrow
Funds and (ii) the holding and disbursement of the General Escrow Buyer Stock
and sets forth in their entirety the obligations and duties of Escrow Agent
with respect to the Special Escrow Funds or the General Escrow Buyer Stock.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person other than the signatory parties hereto and the Indemnified
Parties any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.



24.Execution in Counterparts, Facsimiles. This Agreement and any Joint Written
Direction may be executed in two or more counterparts, which when so executed
shall constitute one and the same agreement or direction. The delivery of
copies of this Agreement and any Joint Written Direction and their respective
signature pages as a PDF attachment to an email or by facsimile transmission
in accordance with Section 16 shall constitute effective execution and
delivery as to the parties and may be used in lieu of originals for all
purposes.



25.Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the distribution of all
the Escrowed Property pursuant to any applicable provision of this Agreement,
and Escrow Agent shall thereafter have no further obligation or liability
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or the Escrowed Property.



26.Dealings. Escrow Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee
of Escrow Agent may buy, sell and deal in any of the securities of any other
party hereto and become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which any
other party hereto may be interested, and contract and lend money to any other
party hereto and otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not
Escrow Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude Escrow Agent
from acting in any other capacity for any other party hereto or for any other
person or entity.



27.Brokerage Confirmation Waiver. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that to the
extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency or other applicable
regulatory entity grant either the right to receive brokerage confirmations
for certain security transactions as they occur, Buyer and Seller specifically
waive receipt of such confirmations to the extent permitted by law. Escrow
Agent will furnish Buyer and Seller periodic cash transaction statements that
include detail for all investment transactions made by Escrow Agent.



28.Tax Reporting. Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the tax
consequences of this Agreement on Buyer or Seller, and Buyer and Seller shall
consult with independent counsel concerning any and all tax matters. Buyer and
Seller shall provide Escrow Agent a properly completed IRS Form W-9 or Form
W-8, as applicable, for each payee. If requested tax documentation is not so
provided, Escrow Agent is authorized to withhold taxes as required by the
United States Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. Buyer and Seller
have determined that any interest



or income on Special Escrow Funds shall be reported on a cash basis and deemed
to be for the account of Seller. Buyer and Seller have determined that the
General Escrow Buyer Stock and all income (in dividends or otherwise) earned
on the General Escrow Buyer Stock or on the General Escrow Funds shall be
treated as owned by Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall prepare and file all
required tax filings with the IRS and any other applicable taxing authority
required to be prepared and filed thereby pursuant to applicable law; provided
that the parties further agree that:



(a) Escrow Agent IRS Reporting. Except as otherwise agreed by Escrow Agent in
writing, Escrow Agent has no tax reporting or withholding obligation except

with respect to investment income earned on the Special Escrow Funds, the

shall accurately provide Escrow Agent with all information requested by Escrow
Agent in connection with the preparation and filing with the IRS of all
applicable Form 1099 and Form 1042-S documents with respect to all
distributions as well as in the performance of Escrow Agent's other reporting
obligations, if any, under applicable U.S. federal law or regulation.



(b) Indemnification. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless from
any liability or obligation on account of taxes, assessments, additions for
late payment, interest, penalties, expenses and other governmental charges
that may be assessed or asserted against Escrow Agent on account of the
Escrowed Property, the management established hereby, any payment or
distribution of or from the Escrowed Property pursuant to the terms hereof or
other activities performed under the terms of this Agreement, except to the
extent caused by Escrow Agent's bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or willful
misconduct (as finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction). The
indemnification provided by this Section is in addition to any other
indemnification provision of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation
or removal of Escrow Agent and the termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 28(b), as between
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, each of them shall be
responsible for 50% of any amounts payable to Escrow Agent under this Section
28(b).



(c) Imputed Interest. To the extent that IRS imputed interest regulations
apply, Buyer and Seller shall so inform Escrow Agent, provide Escrow Agent
with all imputed interest calculations and direct Escrow Agent to disburse
imputed interest amounts as Buyer and Seller deem appropriate. Escrow Agent
shall rely solely on such provided calculations and information and shall have
no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any such calculations or
information.



29.WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL
NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER
SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM
MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE
KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES



IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER
BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A
JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.



30.Publicity. No party will (a) use any other party's proprietary indicia,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, symbols or brand names, or (b)
otherwise refer to or identify any other party in advertising, publicity
releases or promotional or marketing publications, without, in each case,
securing the prior written consent of such other party.

now or hereafter be entitled to claim, for itself or its assets, immunity from
suit, execution, attachment (before or after judgment) or other legal process,
each party irrevocably agrees not to claim, and it hereby waives, such
immunity in connection with this Agreement.

property which is presumed abandoned may under certain circumstances escheat
to the applicable state. Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Buyer or
Seller, their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns,
or any other party, should any or all of the Escrowed Property escheat by
operation of law.
