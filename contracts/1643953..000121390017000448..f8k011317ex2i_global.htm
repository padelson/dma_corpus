as Exhibit L (the " _Tax Receivable Agreement_ "). In addition, promptly
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to) mail to each Optionholder an Option Exercise Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit M (each, an "
_Option Exercise Agreement_ "); after delivery of the Option Exercise
Agreement to the Company (with a copy delivered to Parent) and exercise of
all Company Options held by such Optionholder, such Optionholder shall be
treated thereafter as a Legacy Equityholder holding Legacy Class B Units.
After receipt of the applicable Letter of Transmittal and Related Agreements
to be signed by such Legacy Equityholder, the Legacy Equityholders will
surrender the certificates representing their Legacy Equity (the "
_Legacy Unit Certificates_ ") to the Exchange Agent for cancellation together
with a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and executed
copies of each of the Related Agreements. Upon surrender of a Legacy Unit
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such Letter
of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and the Related Agreements, each duly completed and
validly executed, subject to the terms of _Section 1.6(e)_ , _Section
1.8(d)_,  _Section 1.13_ and _Section 7.3_ , the holder of such Legacy Unit
Certificate shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent in exchange
therefor, the Equity Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 1.6_ and the Legacy Unit Certificate so surrendered shall be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Legacy Unit Certificate outstanding
after the Effective Time will be deemed, for all purposes thereafter, to
evidence only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Equity
Consideration, pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and _Section 1.8_. No portion of the
Equity Consideration (including such holder's Pro Rata Portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, when deliverable) will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Legacy Unit Certificate with respect to Legacy Units formerly
represented thereby or issuable thereunder until the holder of record of such
Legacy Unit Certificate shall surrender such Legacy Unit Certificate, pursuant
hereto.

  



  

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any consideration is to be disbursed
pursuant to _Section 1.6_ to a Person other than the Person whose name is
reflected on the Legacy Unit Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it
will be a condition of the delivery thereof that the certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will have paid to
Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the disbursement of such cash and/or equity amounts to a Person
other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) _Exchange Agent to Return Equity Consideration_. At any time
following the last day of the twelve (12) month period following
the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled (but not obligated) to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign
all equity amounts that have been deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant
to _Section 1.8(b)_, and any income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to
the Legacy Equityholders pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_, and thereafter, if so
delivered, the Legacy Equityholders shall be entitled to look only to Parent
(subject to the terms of _Section 1.8(f)_ and _1.8(g)_ ) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to any and all amounts that may be payable to
such Legacy Equityholders pursuant to _Section 1.6_ upon the due surrender
of such Legacy Unit Certificates in the manner set forth in _Section
1.8(c)_. In the event that Parent does not require the Exchange Agent to
return the consideration amounts to Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.8(e)_
, the agreement between Parent and the Exchange Agent shall provide that the
Exchange Agent shall continue to hold such cash and equity amounts in its
capacity as Exchange Agent, subject to compliance with applicable Law.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 1.8_, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Parent nor
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Units for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g) _Parent to Deliver Balance of Equity Consideration_. At any time
following April 1, 2026 (or the latest expiration date of any Company Options
then outstanding if earlier than April 1, 2026), the Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled (but not obligated) to require Parent to
deliver to the Securityholder Representative or assign all equity amounts that
have been delivered to Parent pursuant to _Section 1.8(e)_, for further
distribution to the Legacy Equityholders on a pro rata basis based on
their respective portions of the Equity Consideration. In the event that the
Securityholder Representative does not require Parent to return the
consideration amounts to the Securityholder Representative pursuant to this
_Section 1.8(g)_ , Parent shall continue to hold such equity amounts, subject
to compliance with applicable Law.

  



  

1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Units._ __ The Equity
Consideration paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of Company Units
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to shares of Company Units, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Entity of
Company Units which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Legacy Unit Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article I_.

  

 _ _

  

1.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any Legacy
Unit Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving
Entity shall issue, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may
be required pursuant to _Section 1.6_; _provided, however,_ that either the
Exchange Agent or Parent may, in each of their discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Equityholder who is the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to provide an indemnification
agreement in a form and substance acceptable to the Exchange Agent and Parent,
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Subject to the terms of _Section 1.6(e)_ and _Section 7.3_ , any Equityholder
complying with the provisions of this _Section 1.10 _shall be deemed to have
surrendered such lost, stolen or destroyed Legacy Unit Certificate for all
purposes hereunder, including for purposes of receiving the cash and/or equity
to which such Equityholder is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ __ If at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Entity with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, Parent, Sub, and the officers and
directors of the Company, Parent and Sub are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action.

  



  

1.12 _S tipulated Values. _Each of the Company, Parent, Sub
and the Securityholder Representative acknowledges and agrees that
the Unit Price and the number of units constituting the Equity
Consideration are based upon values that have been agreed upon
between Parent and the Company for purposes of this Agreement and
may not represent their fair market or intrinsic value
as determined by a third party.

  



  

1.13 _Intended Tax Treatment and Purchase Price Allocation._ __ For
United States federal income Tax purposes (and, where applicable, state and
local income Tax purposes) only, all parties hereto will treat the Surviving
Entity as a continuation of the Company as a partnership and will treat the
acquisition of the Legacy Equity followed by the Cash Distribution as a
purchase by Parent of such Legacy Equity, in a transaction with respect to
which an election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code shall be made. The cash
distributable to the Legacy Equityholders, increased by all other items of
consideration, including liabilities for federal income tax purposes, shall
be allocated in a manner consistent with Exhibit N (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation_ "), and such allocation shall be finalized within sixty (60) days
of the Closing Date. If the final consideration is amended, the Purchase
Price Allocation shall be amended in accordance with Exhibit N. All parties to
this Agreement agree to file all United States Tax Returns in accordance with
such Purchase Price Allocation and the intended tax treatment as set forth in
this  _Section 1.13_. For United States Tax purposes, there will be a
technical termination and closing of the Tax year on the change of control
occurring in connection with the Merger. The parties hereto agree that they
will make a 754 election for the calendar year beginning after consummation
of the Transactions. If any dispute arises regarding the Purchase Price
Allocation, any such dispute shall be submitted for determination to a
nationally recognized expert (the " _Expert_ ") in the particular area of
disagreement mutually acceptable to both parties. The Expert shall be a
partner or principal in a nationally recognized accounting or law firm, and
unless Parent and the Securityholder Representative agree otherwise, the
Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any
material relationship with Parent or the Legacy Equityholders or other actual
or potential conflict of interest. If the parties are unable to agree on an
Expert within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the respondent(s) of written
notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, the Expert shall be appointed by the
Qualified Tax Advisor (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement). The
Expert shall resolve any such matter within thirty (30) calendar days or
as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the
matter has been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is
the subject of a disagreement would be due (in the absence of such
disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is
due, such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by Parent, subject to
adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The costs and expenses relating to
the engagement of such Expert, amending any Tax Return and the proceeding
shall be borne by Parent except as provided in the next sentence. Parent and
the Legacy Equityholders shall bear their own costs and expenses of such
proceeding, unless the Securityholder Representative has a prevailing
position that is more than 10% of the payment at issue, in which case Parent
shall reimburse the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Legacy
Equityholders) for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in such
proceeding. The determinations of the Expert pursuant to this _Section 1.13_
shall be binding on Parent and the Legacy Equityholders and may be entered
and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

or (b) the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions
of _Section 8.1_, the Company shall not (nor shall the Company permit, as
applicable, any of its officers, managers, employees, equityholders, agents,
representatives, Subsidiaries or Affiliates to), directly or indirectly, take
any of the following actions with any party other than Parent and its
designees: (i) solicit, encourage, seek, entertain, support, assist, initiate
or participate in any inquiry, negotiations or discussions, or enter into any
agreement, with respect to any offer or proposal to acquire all or any

accordance with _Section 8.1_, any offer, proposal, or request, directly or
indirectly, of the type referenced in clause (i), (iii), or (iv) above, or any
request for disclosure or access as referenced in clause (ii) above, the

definitive agreement with respect to a transaction that would prohibit or
materially impair its ability to consummate the Merger; (b) Parent will

impair its ability to consummate the Merger; and (c) Parent shall give the

(b) The Company shall promptly provide, and The Ripley Revocable Trust
shall cause John F. Ripley to provide, to Parent all information concerning
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that may be required by applicable
Law or Nasdaq or reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy

Ripley or Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or Proxy Documents
shall not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time
prior to the Closing, a party hereto discovers that any such information
contains a misstatement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, such party shall promptly notify the
other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC by Parent and disseminated to the stockholders of
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no information received by any party
hereto pursuant to this _Section 5.1(b)_ shall operate as a waiver or
otherwise affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by
the party who disclosed such information, and no such information shall be
deemed to change, supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule or Parent
Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(c) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by

stop order, or of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information.

5.3 _Confidentiality. _ The Company and the Equityholders hereto
recognize and acknowledge that the Confidential Information is a valuable,
special and unique asset. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, as a result, from
and after the Closing, the Equityholders shall not, and the Equityholders
shall cause each of their respective Affiliates not to, without the prior
written consent of Parent, for any reason divulge to any third party or use
for its own benefit, or for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of
Parent and Parent's Affiliates, any Confidential Information. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Equityholders, or any of their respective Affiliates
are compelled to disclose Confidential Information by court order, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, such Person promptly shall notify Parent
so that Parent may seek a protective order or other assurance that
confidential treatment of such Confidential Information shall be afforded,
and the Equityholders shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Affiliates to, as the case may be, reasonably cooperate with
Parent and Parent's Affiliates in connection therewith. If the Equityholders
or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, are so obligated by
court order to disclose Confidential Information, they will disclose only the
minimum amount of such Confidential Information as is necessary for such
Person to comply with such court order. For purposes of this _Section 5.3_ ,
" _Confidential Information_ " shall mean non-public information concerning
the financial data, strategic business plans, product development (or other
proprietary product data), customer lists and requirements, marketing plans
and other non-public, proprietary and confidential information relating to
the Business, including the existence of this Agreement and the Transactions
or any negotiations or discussions with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
above, the Equityholders may disclose to each of their respective Affiliates,
accounting, legal and financial advisors, and lenders under the Credit
Agreement or the Credit Agreement Amendment, in each case who need to know
such information.

  



  

5.4 _Expenses. _ If the Merger is not consummated, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting, and all other fees and expenses
of third parties (including any costs incurred to obtain consents, waivers or
approvals as a result of the compliance with _Section 5.6_) incurred by a
party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Transactions, including, in the case of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, any bonuses paid or to be paid to
employees or consultants of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and any Transaction Payroll Taxes (all such fees and expenses
referenced in this sentence incurred by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or Parent or Sponsor, the " _Third Party Expenses_ "),
shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and
expenses. If the Merger is consummated, the amount of any Third Party Expenses
shall be deducted from the Distribution pursuant to _Section 5.17_. The
amount of any Third Party Expenses of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries that are not reflected on the Statement of Expenses and treated
as Company Third Party Expenses (" _Excess Third Party Expenses_ "), shall be
subject to the indemnification provision of _Section 7.2_ and shall not be
limited by the Threshold Amount or the maximum amount of indemnification
provided in _Sections 7.4_ or _7.7_.

5.5 _Public Disclosure._ __ Except as may be required to comply with
the requirements of any applicable Law (including as set forth in _Section
5.1_ ), neither the Company, nor the Company Subsidiaries, nor any of its
Equityholders shall issue any press release or other public announcement or
submit any application to or otherwise communicate with any Governmental
Authority with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the
Transactions without the prior approval (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Parent; provided, however, that timely
submission of renewal license applications and submission of data or reports
to Payors, governmental agencies or accreditation organization in the ordinary
course of business shall not be prohibited by this _Section 5.5_ and shall
not require prior approval of Parent, nor shall communications by the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice; provided further, however,
that none of Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, nor any of its
Legacy Equityholders shall issue any press release or other public
announcement or submit any application to or otherwise communicate with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
or the Transactions without the prior approval (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Preferred Holder or the Financing
Source, as applicable, to the extent that such press releases or public
announcements refer to the Preferred Holder or the Financing Source, as
applicable, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

5.6 _Consents. _ The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any
Contract as are required thereunder in connection with the Merger or for any
such Contracts to remain in full force and effect so as to preserve all
rights of, and benefits to, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries under such
Contract from and after the Effective Time. In the event that, prior to the
Effective Time, the other parties to any Contract, including lessor or
licensor of any real property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or
from the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise used or occupied by
the same, conditions its grant of a consent, waiver or approval (including by
threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon the
payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration,
including increased rent payments or other payments under the Contract, the
Company shall be responsible for making all payments required to obtain such
consent, waiver or approval and such amounts shall be deemed Third Party
Expenses under _Section 5.4_.

  



  

5.7 _Additional Documents and Further Assurances; Reasonable Efforts._

execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts
and things as may be reasonably necessary or desirable for effecting
completely the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, to satisfy the conditions to the obligations to consummate the
Merger, to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect
all necessary registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions or

(a) _Offer Letters with Key Employees._ Parent or the Surviving Entity
will offer each of the Key Employees employment by Parent, the Surviving
Entity or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable and to the extent allowed
under applicable Law, to be effective as of the Closing Date. Such employment
will: (i) be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer
Letters, (ii) be subject to and in compliance with Parent's applicable
policies and procedures, including employment background checks,
the execution of an employee proprietary information agreement governing
employment conduct and performance, and (iii) supersede any prior express or
implied employment agreements, arrangements, representations, or offer letters
in effect prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) _Employee Matters._ Each employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries who remains an employee of Parent, the Surviving Entity or the
Company Subsidiaries after the Closing Date shall be referred to hereafter as
a " _Continuing Employee_." To the extent reasonably practicable, after the
Closing Date, Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive benefits
consistent with the Company's applicable human resources policies for
similarly situated employees. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
confer upon any Continuing Employee any right with respect to employment by
Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Company, nor shall anything herein
interfere with the right of Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Company,
following any employment of any Continuing Employee, to terminate the
employment of any such Continuing Employee at any time, with or without cause,
or restrict Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Company in the exercise of
their independent business judgment in modifying any of the terms and
conditions of the employment of any such Continuing Employee. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section
5.8_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that nothing
herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary
right in any other Person, including any Continuing Employee, or any right to
continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 5.8_ or in any other
provision of this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be deemed to be
the adoption of, an amendment to or other modification of any Benefit Plan or
any benefit plan, policy, program, Contract or arrangement of Parent, the
Surviving Entity or any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise to limit
the right of the Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any such employee benefit plan
policy, program, Contract or arrangement.

5.9 _Tax Matters._

  

 _ _

  

(a) _Preparation of Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. Parent
shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all
Tax Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to a
taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date that are required to
be filed after the Closing Date, and shall timely remit, or cause to be
remitted, to the appropriate Governmental Authority all Taxes required to be
paid with respect to such Tax Returns, subject to the Parent Indemnified
Parties' right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ ; provided
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the amount of any Tax
shown as due on any such Tax Return for which the Parent Indemnified Parties
are indemnified hereunder shall be paid to Parent five (5) Business Days
before the due date of the Tax Return (taking into account any applicable
extension of the time for filing). To the extent such Tax Returns include any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with
applicable Law and consistent with the past practices of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in all material respects except to the extent necessary
in Parent's reasonable judgment to avoid the imposition of penalties;
_provided that_ Parent shall give the Securityholder Representative (on
behalf of the Legacy Equityholders) and the Preferred Holder thirty (30) days
to review such Tax Return, provided that Parent receives the completed Tax
Return from its accountants with adequate time to review prior to providing
to the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Legacy Equityholders)
and the Preferred Holder; _provided further that_ such Tax Return shall be
subject to the prior approval of the Securityholder Representative (on behalf
of the Legacy Equityholders) and the Preferred Holder, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which must be given
at least five (5) Business Days before the due date of the Tax Return (taking
into account any applicable extension of the time for filing, and provided
that Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Legacy
Equityholders) and the Preferred Holder having received at least thirty (30)
days to review such Tax Return), and if such approval is not timely received,
Parent shall have the right to file the Tax Return without receipt of such
approval.

  



  

(b) _No Amended Tax Returns_. After the Closing, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to (i) amend any previously filed Tax
Return of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or (ii) make any Tax election that has any retroactive effect in
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, without the prior written consent
of the Securityholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters._ __ Each of the Company on the
one hand, and Parent on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to the other
of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to
the Effective Time (as though given on or as of the Effective Time), and (b)
any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_
shall not (i) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party
receiving such notice or (ii) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a
breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by a party pursuant to this _Section
5.10_ shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or
prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of
covenant.

5.11 _No Claims Against Trust Account._ __ Each Equityholder and the
Company acknowledges that the Trust Account was established in connection
with Parent's initial public offering and is held for the benefit of Parent's
public stockholders (the " _Public Stockholders_ "). Each Equityholder and
the Company acknowledges that Parent has made certain assurances to Parent's
stockholders regarding the security of the Trust Account against claims of
creditors. For and in consideration of Parent entering into this Agreement,
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, each Equityholder and the Company on behalf of
themselves and their respective equityholders, members,
Representatives, associates, Affiliates, heirs, successors and assigns hereby
irrevocably waives all rights, title, interest or claim of any
kind regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity
or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are
collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Claims_ ") in or to any assets in
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) it has or may have
in the future, including any and all rights to seek access to the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom), and hereby agrees not to
seek recourse, reimbursement, payment or satisfaction against the Trust
Account or any funds distributed therefrom for any Claim it may have against
Parent or any of its Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives for any
reason whatsoever, including an alleged breach of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other Contract
entered into with any of the parties hereto or their Affiliates or any
negotiations, agreements or understandings with any of the parties hereto
(whether in the past, present or future). This waiver is intended and shall
be deemed and construed to be irrevocable and absolute on the part of each
Equityholder and the Company, and shall be valid, binding and enforceable
against each Equityholder and the Company and their respective equityholders,
members, Representatives, associates, Affiliates, heirs, successors and
assigns. Each Equityholder and the Company acknowledges that it benefits from
this Agreement, that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement,
and that Parent is entering into this Agreement in reliance upon this
_Section 5.11_. In the event that an Equityholder or the Company commences any
claim or litigation based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising
out of any matter relating to Parent or its Representatives, which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) or the Public Stockholders, whether in the form of
money damages or injunctive relief, Parent shall be entitled to recover from
the Equityholders or the Company, as the case may be, the associated legal
fees and costs in connection with any such action. This _Section 5.11_ shall
survive termination of this Agreement.

  



  

5.12 _Agreement to Defend._ __ In the event any Proceeding by any
Governmental Authority or other Person is commenced that questions the
validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection
therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to defend against and respond thereto.

  



  

5.13 _Change of Name; Listing._ __ Prior to the Closing, Parent shall
apply for a new ticker symbol with Nasdaq that reflects the name "Sequel
Youth and Family Services" contingent on obtaining Parent Stockholder Approval
and required approval of the Required Approval Matters and shall undertake
commercially reasonable efforts to adopt the new name. From the date of
this Agreement through the Closing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to remain listed as a public company on Nasdaq.

5.14 _Debt Financing; Equity Financing; Cooperation._

  

 _ _

  

(a) _Debt Financing._ The Company shall use (and cause its applicable
Company Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
lenders party to the Credit Agreement (the " _Financing Source_ ") and
applicable Company Subsidiaries to enter into the Credit Agreement Amendment
as promptly as possible following the date hereof, permitting the change of
control with respect to the Company contemplated by this Agreement and
certain other matters. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to continue the Debt Financing on the terms (or on terms not materially less
favorable to each of Parent, Sub and the Company and its Subsidiaries) and
conditions described in Schedule 5.14(a). Each of Parent, Sub and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing with the Financing
Source and (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the Credit
Agreement Amendment, including using commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Financing Source to consummate the Credit Agreement Amendment at Closing.
The Company shall allow Parent to participate in the negotiation of the Debt
Financing and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep Parent
reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to Parent copies of
the material definitive agreements for the Debt Financing and such other
information and documentation available to them as shall be reasonably
requested by the Company for purposes of monitoring the progress of the
financing activities and assisting in the negotiation thereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall give Parent prompt notice (A) of any breach or default of
any material provisions by any party to definitive agreements related to the
Debt Financing of which the Company or the Company Subsidiaries become aware,
(B) of the receipt of (1) any written notice or (2) other written
communication, in each case from the Financing Source with respect to any
actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing and (C) if
at any time for any reason the Company believes in good faith that it will
not be able to continue all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days of the date Parent
delivers to the Company a written request, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall provide any information reasonably requested by
Parent relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of
the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
such event, and on terms reasonably comparable to the Debt Financing. The
Company shall deliver to Parent true and complete copies of all Contracts or
other arrangements (including fee letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt
Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Debt Financing"
shall include the alternate financing as permitted by this _Section 5.14_.

  



  

(b) _Equity Financing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Equity Financing. Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Equity Financing (such definitive
agreements, the " _Equity Financing Documents_ "), (ii) to satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions to consummation of the Equity Financing set forth
in the Equity Financing Documents (other than any condition where the failure
to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Company's failure to furnish
information described in this _Section 5.14_ ), to consummate the Equity
Financing at or prior to the Closing and to comply with its obligations under
any Equity Financing Documents. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Equity
Financing and provide to the Company copies of the Equity Financing Documents
and such other information and documentation available to them as shall be
reasonably requested by the Company for purposes of monitoring the progress of
the financing activities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach or default of
any material provisions by any party to any Equity Financing Documents of
which Parent or the Sub become aware, (B) of the receipt of (1) any written
notice or (2) other written communication, in each case from any party to any
Equity Financing Documents with respect to any (x) actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Equity
Financing Documents of any provisions of the Equity Financing Documents or
(y) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Equity Financing Documents or definitive agreements related to the Equity
Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the Equity Financing or the
amount of the Equity Financing to be funded at Closing and (C) if at any time
for any reason Parent believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Equity Financing. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days of the date the
Company delivers to Parent a written request, Parent shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding
sentence; provided, however, subject to the rules of discovery otherwise
applicable, that they need not provide any information that is privileged or
that is requested for purposes of litigation. If any portion of the Equity
Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative
financing from alternative sources with terms and conditions not materially
less favorable to Parent, Sub and the Company (or their respective Affiliates)
than the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Documents.
For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Equity Financing" shall
include the alternate financing as permitted by this _Section 5.14(b)_ and
"Equity Financing Documents" shall include such documents related to the
alternative financing as permitted by this _Section 5.14(b)_.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Parent, and shall cause each of the
Company's Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the Equity
Financing (the " _Financing_ ") (provided that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries), which commercially reasonable efforts shall include
(i) furnishing Parent, Sub and their Financing Sources, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following Parent's request, with information regarding
the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries (including information to be used
in the preparation of one or more information packages regarding the
business, operations, financial projections and prospects of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) customary for the placement, arrangement and/or
syndication of loans contemplated by the Debt Financing, to the extent
reasonably available to the Company and reasonably requested in writing by
Parent to assist in preparation of customary offering or information
documents or rating agency or lender presentations relating to such
arrangement of loans, (ii) furnishing all required information of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as
lead arrangers, bookrunners or agents for, and prospective lenders of, a Debt
Financing and senior management and representatives, with appropriate
seniority and expertise, of the Company), presentations, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection
with a Debt Financing, (iv) assisting with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, and similar documents
required in connection with a Debt Financing; provided that any rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda, and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing shall contain disclosure reflecting the
Surviving Entity or the Subsidiaries as the obligor, (v) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain legal opinions reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Debt Financing, (vi) executing and delivering any
customary pledge and security documents (subject to occurrence of the
Effective Time) and customary closing certificates and documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, (vii) assisting in (A) the preparation and
execution of one or more credit agreements, currency or interest hedging
agreements or (B) the amendment of any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
currency or interest hedging agreements, in each case, on terms that are
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing; provided
that no obligation of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries under any such
agreements or amendments shall be effective until the Effective Time, (viii)
facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Financing (including the
delivery of original unit certificates, together with unit powers executed in
blank, with respect to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries), including
taking reasonable actions necessary to permit the Financing Sources to
evaluate the Company's and its Subsidiaries' assets for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements, (ix) reasonably cooperating with
Parent's efforts to obtain surveys and title insurance for the Company
Property, at the expense of and as reasonably requested by Parent on behalf
of the Financing Sources, (x) cooperating with the Financing Sources' requests
for due diligence to the extent customary and reasonable; (xi) at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing all documentation and
other information about the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as is
reasonably requested in writing by Parent at least nine (9) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Debt Financing that relates

regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act; (xii) using commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Financing Sources in their efforts to benefit

and necessary to permit the Financing Sources to evaluate the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' inventory, current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, and policies and procedures relating thereto, for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements. The Company hereby consents to the use
of its and the Company Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing;
provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. If at any time the Company shall in good faith reasonably
believe that it has provided all required information as required by clause
(ii) above, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to that effect (stating
the date it believes such required information was provided), in which case
the Company shall be deemed to have complied with such clause (ii)
above unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not
provided all required information and, within five (5) Business Days after
the delivery of such notice, delivers a written notice to the Company to that
effect, stating with reasonable specificity which items of required
information have not been provided.

Equityholder may have previously instructed the Escrow Agent in writing). The

Revenue Service Form 1099-B (or other applicable forms) for the tax year in
which the distribution is made, other than amounts properly reported as
interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The parties hereto further

incurred indemnifiable Losses pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)_ and this _Section
7.4_ in excess of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) in the aggregate (the "
_Threshold Amount_ "), in which case the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover the total amount of all Losses exceeding the Threshold
Amount, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. A Parent
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for, and the Threshold Amount
shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with
respect to (A) Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (ii)-(vi) of _Section
7.2(a)_, (B) Losses resulting from any breach of a representation or warranty
contained in any Fundamental Representation (other than those contained in
_Sections 2.9_ (Intellectual Property) and _2.10_ (Information Technology,
Privacy and Security)), and (C) Losses resulting from fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct, and no such claims or payments shall
be considered in determining whether the Threshold Amount has been reached.

(ii) Except as set forth in the second sentence of this _Section
7.4(a)(ii)_, a Company Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under
_Section 7.2(b)_ unless and until one or more Securityholder's Certificates
identifying such Losses under  _Section 7.2(b)_ in excess of the Threshold
Amount has or have been delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent as
provided in _Section 7.4(c)_, in which case the Company Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover the total amount of all Losses in excess of the
Threshold Amount, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. A
Company Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for, and the Threshold
Amount shall not apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made
with respect to (A) Losses incurred pursuant to clause (ii) and/or clause
(iii) of _Section 7.2(b)_, and (B) Losses resulting from any breach of a
representation or warranty contained in any Fundamental Representation (other
than those contained in _Sections 2.9_ (Intellectual Property) and _2.10_
(Information Technology, Privacy and Security)), and (C) Losses resulting
from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, and no such
claims or payments shall be considered in determining whether the Threshold
Amount has been reached.

  



  

(b) _Materiality Threshold._ Except with respect to the
representations in _Sections 2.5(a)_ and _2.11(a)(xxii)_ , from and after the
Closing for purposes of determining the amount of any Losses that are the
subject matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder (but not for purposes
of determining whether a party is entitled to indemnity hereunder), each
representation and warranty and covenant in this Agreement and each
certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto shall be read without regard
and without giving effect to the term(s) "material", "Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar qualifier, as if such words and surrounding related
words (e.g., "reasonably be expected to" and similar restrictions and
qualifiers) were deleted from such representation and warranty or covenant.

  



  

(c) _Claims for Indemnification_. In order for a Parent Indemnified
Party to seek indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)_ against the amounts
held in the Escrow Fund or otherwise pursuant to this _Article VII_ , Parent
shall deliver a Parent Certificate to be received by the Securityholder
Representative and the Escrow Agent (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable)
at any time on or before 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Survival Date;
_provided, however_ , Parent may seek indemnification for a breach of a
representation and warranty of the Company contained in any Fundamental
Representations following the expiration of the Escrow Period by delivering a
Parent Certificate to the Securityholder Representative on or before 11:59
p.m. Eastern time on the Fundamental Representations Survival Date;
_provided, further_ , that Parent may seek indemnification based on fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct or pursuant to any matter
set forth in clauses _(ii)-(vi)_ of _Section 7.2(a)_ following
the expiration of the Escrow Period by delivering a Parent Certificate to the
Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable). In
order for a Company Indemnified Party to seek indemnification under _Section
7.2(b)_, the Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as
applicable) shall deliver a Securityholder Certificate to be received by
Parent at any time on or before 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Survival Date,
or the Fundamental Representations Survival Date, as applicable;  _provided,_
that the Company Indemnified Party may seek indemnification based on fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct or pursuant to any matter
set forth in clauses _(ii)-(iii)_ of _Section 7.2(b)_ after the Survival Date,
or the Fundamental Representations Survival Date, as applicable, by
delivering a Securityholder Certificate to Parent. Unless the Securityholder
Representative shall have delivered an Objection Notice pursuant to _Section
7.4(d)_, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than the
thirty-first (31st) day after its receipt of the Parent Certificate, deliver
to the Parent Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund a number of Survivor
Class B Units equal to the equal to the Loss set forth in such Parent
Certificate _divided by_ the Current Price. Any payment from the Escrow Fund
shall be deemed to have been made pro rata amongst the Legacy Equityholders
based on their respective Pro Rata Portions of the Indemnity Escrow Amount.
For the purposes hereof, (i) " _Parent Certificate_ " shall mean a
certificate signed by any officer of Parent: (A) stating that a Parent
Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or
reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue
Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances of
individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each
such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis
for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related and (ii) "
_Securityholder Certificate_ " shall mean a certificate signed by the
Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable): (A)
stating that a Company Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or
properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay,
sustain, incur, or accrue Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances of the individual items of Losses included in the
amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or
properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature
of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item
is related.

(d) _Objections to Claims for Indemnification_. No payment shall be
made under _Section 7.4(c)_ nor shall a claim be applied against the
Threshold Amount under _Section 7.4(a)(i)_ (until and to the extent resolved
in favor of the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ )
if the Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable)
or Parent, as the case may be, shall object to the claim made in the Parent
Certificate or Securityholder Certificate, as applicable, in a
written statement labeled "Objection Notice" (an " _Objection Notice_ "), and
such Objection Notice shall have been received by (i) Parent (and the Escrow
Agent, if applicable) prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the thirtieth
(30th) day after its receipt of the Parent Certificate, in the case of an
Objection Notice made by the Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred
Holder, as applicable), or (ii) the Securityholder Representative (or the
Preferred Holder, as applicable) prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the
thirtieth (30th) day after Parent's receipt of the Securityholder
Certificate, in the case of an Objection Notice made by Parent. If the
Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable) or
Parent, as applicable, does not object in writing within such 30-day period,
such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by, as
applicable, (x) the Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as
applicable) that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount
of the claim for Losses set forth in such Parent Certificate, and payment in
respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with _Section
7.4(c)_ or (y) Parent that the Company Indemnified Party is entitled to the
full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in the Securityholder
Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made
promptly to the Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as
applicable) on behalf of the Company Indemnified Parties.

(e) _Resolution of Conflicts_.

  



  

(i) In case the Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder,
as applicable) or Parent delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with
_Section 7.4(d)_, the Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder,
as applicable) and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Securityholder Representative and Parent should so agree, and such claim
involves a claim against the Escrow Fund, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and furnished to the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof by delivering to the appropriate party or parties a number of
Survivor Class B Units based on the Current Price.

  



  

(ii) At any time following delivery of an Objection Notice by the
Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable) to
Parent or vice versa or in the event of any dispute arising pursuant to
_Article VII_ , either Parent, on the one hand, or the Securityholder
Representative(or the Preferred Holder, as applicable), on the other hand, may
pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies available to them under
applicable Law.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.4(e)_ to the
contrary, upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time or from time to time of
(A) joint written instructions signed by Parent and the Securityholder
Representative directing the Escrow Agent to release to either party or their
designees all or any portion of the remaining Escrow Fund or (B) an order,
judgment or decree from a court of competent jurisdiction (an " _Order_ ")
(together with a certificate of the presenting party to the effect that such
judgment is from a court of competent jurisdiction, upon which certificate the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely without further
investigation) instructing the Escrow Agent to release to either party all or
any portion of the remaining Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, but not later than three (3) Business Days after
receipt of such instructions or Order, distribute whatever portion of the
remaining Escrow Fund that is specified in such joint written instructions or
Order, in such manner and to such parties as such instructions or Order shall
specify, based on the Current Price.

  



  

   

 | -69-|

(f) _Third Party Claims_. After the Closing, in the event an
Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third party claim (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a
demand for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_, Parent shall
notify the Escrow Agent (if the Third Party Claim is made by Parent prior to
the release of the Escrow Fund) and the Securityholder Representative (or the
Preferred Holder, as applicable) in writing of such claim and Securityholder
Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable) shall notify Parent in
writing of such claim, as applicable. If the Third Party Claim may result in
a claim against the Escrow Fund or against the Legacy Equityholders (or the
Preferred Holder, as applicable), the Securityholder Representative on behalf
of the Legacy Equityholders (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable), shall
be entitled, at its expense, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
Third Party Claim to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its
own choosing and at its own expense, the settlement or defense thereof. If the
Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable) elects
to undertake the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall so notify the
Indemnified Party that it intends to assume the control of the defense of
such claim and the Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as
applicable) shall conduct any such defense reasonably and in good faith, and
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate with its own counsel
at its own expense; __provided that__ , if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel for such Indemnified Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of a
conflict of interest between the interests of the Legacy Equityholders and
those of the Indemnified Party concerning such claim by a third Person, then
the reasonable cost of one counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be borne
by the Legacy Equityholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholder
Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable) shall not be entitled
to control, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control
over, the defense or settlement of any claim by a third Person (i) relating
to or arising primarily in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal
Proceeding or (ii) that primarily involves any Payor or vendor of the
Surviving Entity or the Company Subsidiaries;  _provided that_ , in the event
that any claim is settled without the consent of the Securityholder
Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable) (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such settlement shall
not be dispositive of the amount of Losses. The Securityholder Representative
(or the Preferred Holder, as applicable) shall not, except with the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or compromise any
claim by a third Person that (A) does not include as a term thereof the
giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim, on behalf of such
Persons and their respective Affiliates, to all Indemnified Parties of a full
and unconditional release of all such Indemnified Parties from all Liability
(subject to the application of the Threshold) with respect to such claim or
consent to entry of any judgment; (B) involves any finding or admission of
any violation of Law; or (C) involves any non-monetary relief or remedy. Any
consent required by this _Section 7.4(f)_  shall not be unreasonably delayed,
withheld or conditioned. If the Securityholder Representative (or the
Preferred Holder, as applicable) does not notify the Indemnified Party in
writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of the Third Party
Claim that it elects to undertake the defense of the claim described therein,
then Parent shall have the right to undertake the defense or prosecution of
such claim through counsel of its own choice, in which event it shall do so in
good faith and using commercially reasonable efforts, it shall keep the
Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable)
reasonably informed of all material developments and it shall permit the
Securityholder Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable),
at its own cost and expense, to participate in all meetings and to review and
comment on all pleadings and material correspondence related thereto, it
being understood that the reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such defense or prosecution shall be
considered Losses hereunder with respect to the subject matter of such claim,
indemnifiable to the extent provided in _Section 7.2_ ; _provided that_ , in
the event that any claim is settled without the consent of the Securityholder
Representative (or the Preferred Holder, as applicable) (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such settlement shall
not be dispositive of the amount of Losses. In the event that the
Securityholder Representative has consented to any such settlement in respect
of the Legacy Equityholders, the Legacy Equityholders shall have no power or
authority to object to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent.

(g) _Indemnity Remedy_. The RandW Insurance Policy, together with any
then-remaining funds in the Escrow Fund, shall constitute the sole and
exclusive source of funds available to the Parent Indemnified Parties to seek
indemnification for any Losses hereunder (except for Losses arising out of
any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, for breaches
of Fundamental Representations (other than those contained in _Sections 2.9_
(Intellectual Property) and _2.10_ (Information Technology, Privacy
and Security)), or pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(ii)-(vi)_ , none of which
shall be so limited after the Escrow Fund has been reduced to zero and the
$25,000,000 cap on the RandW Insurance Policy has been met (or such coverage is
not available under the RandW Insurance Policy)). Once the Escrow Fund is
reduced to zero, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no further rights
to indemnification hereunder, except for Losses arising out of any fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, for breaches of
Fundamental Representations (other than those contained in _Sections 2.9_
(Intellectual Property) and _2.10_ (Information Technology, Privacy and
Security)), or pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(ii)-(vi)_ , none of which shall be
so limited after the Escrow Fund has been reduced to zero and the $25,000,000
cap on the RandW Insurance Policy has been met (or such coverage is not
available under the RandW Insurance Policy). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the limitations or exceptions
set forth in this _Article VII_ , including any periods of survival with
respect to the representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein,
shall in any way limit or modify the ability of the Parent Indemnified Parties
to make claims under or recover under the RandW Insurance Policy.

  



  

(h) In no event (other than a Legacy Equityholder's fraud or
intentional misrepresentation) will any Legacy Equityholder be liable for
Losses to the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement in an
aggregate amount in excess of the value of such Legacy Equityholder's Equity
(A-B) Consideration (based on the Unit Price) and Cash Distribution. In no
event (other than Preferred Holder's fraud or intentional misrepresentation)
will the Preferred Holder be liable for Losses to the Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement in an aggregate amount in
excess of the amount of the payment to the Preferred Holder made pursuant to
the Distribution Agreement.

Agreement, each of the Legacy Equityholders appoints John F. Ripley as its

this Agreement or such Related Agreements, and to take all other actions that
are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the discretion of the
Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Notices or
communications to or from the Securityholder Representative shall constitute
notice to or from the Legacy Equityholders with respect to this Agreement or
such Related Agreements.

(b) The power of attorney hereunder is irrevocable and coupled with an
interest, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall survive the
death or disability of a Legacy Equityholder, and the transfer of any portion
of the Equity Consideration or other amounts in accordance with _Section 1.8_
of this Agreement or the Distribution in accordance with _Section 5.17_ of
this Agreement. The Securityholder Representative shall have the power (from
time to time) to select and appoint his successor
Securityholder Representative, and to revoke a prior selection and
appointment of his successor, by providing written notice thereof to
Parent. In the event a vacancy in the position of Securityholder
Representative exists for fifteen (15) or more days, Parent shall have the
right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a replacement
Securityholder Representative. No bond shall be required of the
Securityholder Representative, and the Securityholder Representative shall not
receive any compensation for its services (notwithstanding its right to
reimbursement of expenses including from the Representative Fund). The
Securityholder Representative shall have sole control of withdrawals from, or
other decisions with respect to, the Representative Fund, and the Parent

performing its duties as the Securityholder Representative, (ii)
indemnification of the Securityholder Representative by the Legacy
Equityholders under agreements between the Securityholder Representative
and the Legacy Equityholders, (iii) satisfaction of any contribution claim
the Securityholder Representative has against Legacy Equityholders for any

such Securityholder Representative's Pro Rata Portion of the Legacy
Equityholders, and (iv) satisfaction of any indemnification claims by the
Parent Indemnified Parties against the Legacy Equityholders.

  



  

(c) Until notified in writing by the Securityholder Representative that
he has resigned, or that a successor has been appointed, Parent and the
Escrow Agent may rely conclusively and act upon the directions, instructions
and notices of the Securityholder Representative named above and, thereafter,
upon the directions, instructions and notices of any successor appointed in
accordance with clause "(b)" above. A decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Securityholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or
waiver of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the Legacy
Equityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Legacy
Equityholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Legacy Equityholders.
The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative.

  



  

(d) In addition to, and without limiting, the foregoing, the Company
and each Legacy Equityholder each hereby authorizes the
Securityholder Representative to:

  



  

(i) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the Legacy
Equityholders pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or therewith and to

7.7 _Remedy._

  

 _ _

  

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 7.7(c)_ and _Section 7.7(d)_ , the
maximum amount a Parent Indemnified Party may recover from the Legacy
Equityholders pursuant to the indemnity set forth in _Section 7.2_ for Losses
shall be limited to the Escrow Fund (except for Losses arising out of any
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, for breaches of
Fundamental Representations (other than those contained in _Sections 2.9_
(Intellectual Property) and _2.10_ (Information Technology, Privacy
and Security)), or pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(ii)-(vi)_ , none of which
shall be so limited after the Escrow Fund has been reduced to zero and the
$25,000,000 cap on the RandW Insurance Policy has been met (or such coverage is
not available under the RandW Insurance Policy)). For the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to all representations and warranties other than Fundamental
Representations (other than those contained in _Sections 2.9_ (Intellectual
Property) and _2.10_ (Information Technology, Privacy and Security)) or in
connection with any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful

9.2 _Interpretation. _ The words "include," "includes" and "including"
when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

9.3 _Counterparts. _ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment._ __ This Agreement, the Related
Agreements, the Exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the parties hereto referenced herein: (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) are not
intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder,
and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the
consent of Parent and the Securityholder Representative, other than by Parent
in connection with a change of control of Parent.

  



  

9.5 _Severability. _ In the event that any provision of this Agreement
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

9.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance._ __ Any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive
relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

9.7 _Governing Law; Venue._ __ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within the State of Delaware in
connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the Laws of the State of Delaware for such persons
and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they
might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process.

  



  

   

 | -80-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.8 _Rules of Construction._ __ The parties hereto agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule hereto shall be deemed adequate
to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein unless
the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity
and describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a
document or other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception
to a representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation
or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item
itself). The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in separate parts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained herein
permitting such disclosure, and the information disclosed in any numbered or
lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify (a) the particular
representation or warranty set forth in the corresponding numbered or
lettered section herein permitting such disclosure and (b) any other
representation or warranty that is contained in this Agreement to the extent
the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face to such
other representation or warranty. The parties hereto intend that each
representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have independent
significance. If any party has breached any representation, warranty or
covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter
(regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the party has not
breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in
breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant. In addition, each of
the parties acknowledges and agrees that any purchase price adjustment as a
result of the application of any provision of this Agreement, the Related
Agreements or any of the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby does
not prejudice or limit in any respect whatsoever any party's rights to
indemnification under any other provision of this Agreement, the Related
Agreements or any other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby, except to
the extent that such a recovery would result in a duplication of damages. All
references to dollars or "$" shall refer to U.S. dollars unless otherwise
indicated.

  



  

9.9 _Successors and Assigns._ __ Subject to _Section 9.4_ , the
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

9.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries._ __ Except for the provisions of
_Article VII_ relating to the Indemnified Parties and the Legacy
Equityholders and except for the provisions of this _Section 9.10_ relating to
the Financing Source, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person, any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any
specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary and other than in accordance with the terms of
the Credit Agreement or any definitive Credit Agreement Amendment, the
parties hereto hereby waive any rights or claims against the Financing Source
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and each such Person agrees not to commence (and if
commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any proceeding or legal
or equitable action against the Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing and/or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including any such proceeding or action relating to the Debt
Financing). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it
is agreed that the Financing Source shall not have any liability for any
claims, losses, settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fines or
penalties to any party hereto in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than in accordance with the terms of
the Credit Agreement or any definitive Credit Agreement Amendment).

9.11 _Post-Closing Representation._

  

 _ _

  

(a) Parent, Sponsor and Sub acknowledge and agree that Brown, Winick,
Graves, Gross, Baskerville and Schoenebaum, LLC (" _BrownWinick_ ") has acted
as counsel to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent, Sponsor and Sub, on behalf of themselves and the Company
(from and after Closing), expressly and knowingly consent to BrownWinick
representing any or all of the Legacy Equityholders and the Securityholder
Representative in any matter after the Closing that is or may be adverse to
Parent, Sponsor, Sub or the Company, including any matter arising out of this
Agreement or any agreement executed or delivered in connection herewith.
This consent constitutes an advance waiver of any conflict of interest claim
against BrownWinick as a result of the firm representing the Legacy
Equityholders and the Securityholder Representative in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, Parent, Sponsor, and Sub, on
behalf of themselves and the Company (from and after Closing), expressly and
knowingly (i) acknowledge and agree that all communications between
BrownWinick and the Legacy Equityholders and the officers, directors and
employees of the Company to the extent created for the purpose of advising the
foregoing Persons about the transactions contemplated hereby in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Privileged Material_ ") are
subject to the sole and absolute control of the Securityholder Representative,
(ii) waive any and all rights to obtain or otherwise control the disclosure
of such Privileged Material, (iii) waive any right to access the Privileged
Material, and (iv) covenant and agree not to assert any rights whatsoever
with respect to the Privileged Material. At and after the Closing, the
attorney-client privilege of the Company with BrownWinick related to the
Privileged Material shall be deemed to be the right of the Company, and not
that of Parent or Sponsor, and may be waived only by the Securityholder
Representative. Absent consent of the Securityholder Representative,
following the Closing, neither Parent, Sponsor nor the Company shall have a
right to access the Privileged Material.

  



  

(b) Parent (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby (i) waives
any claim it has or may have that BrownWinick has a conflict of interest or
is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (ii) agrees
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent and
the Securityholder Representative, the Company and any of their respective
Affiliates, BrownWinick may represent the Securityholder Representative, the
Legacy Equityholders or any of their respective Affiliates in such
dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse
to the Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company) and even though
BrownWinick may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related
to such dispute. Parent represents that Parent's own attorney has explained
and helped Parent evaluate the implications and risks of waiving the right to
assert a future conflict against BrownWinick, and Parent's consent with
respect to this waiver is fully informed. In addition, if the Closing
occurs, all of the client files and records in the possession of BrownWinick
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will
continue to be property of (and be controlled by) the Legacy Equityholders and
the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall not retain any copies of
such records or have any access to them. If a dispute arises between Parent
or the Company and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after
the Closing, Parent, the Company or the Securityholder Representative may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by BrownWinick to such third party; provided that, neither the
Company nor the Securityholder Representative may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Parent.

 AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AGREEMENT

  



  

This Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Proprietary Rights Agreement
("Agreement"), is entered into as of [●], 2017 by and between Sequel Youth

"Company"), and [●] (the "Executive").

  



  

WHEREAS, Executive is currently employed by the Sequel Youth and Family
Services, LLC in a position of substantial authority and responsibility;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company has entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger on the date hereof, by and among Global Partner Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Global Partner Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, Sequel Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Sub"), the Company, the Key Equityholders (as defined
therein), and John F. Ripley, as the representative of the Company's
equityholders, pursuant to which Sub merged with and into the Company, with
the Company as the surviving company as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the "Transaction"); and

  



  

WHEREAS, effective upon closing of the Transaction, the Executive has been
offered continued employment with the Company, as provided in the letter
agreement to which this Agreement is attached (the "Offer Letter")[, a
transaction bonus from the Company in connection with the Transaction] and
material consideration proceeds in the Transaction, and the Executive
acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is an essential element of the
Transaction and that, but for Restricted Party's agreement to enter into this
Agreement and comply with the covenants and agreements contained herein,
Parent would not have entered into the Transaction.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in light of the foregoing and other good and valuable
consideration, the adequacy of which the Executive acknowledges, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

1. Covenants. The Executive hereby agrees to the covenants contained in this
Section and agrees that these covenants are essential to preserve the
goodwill of the Company's business and that the Company would not have
completed the Transaction in the absence of these covenants.

  



  

1.1.  _Non-Solicitation_. During Executive's employment by the Company and
for the 12 month period following cessation of that employment for any
reason, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or
on behalf of any other person (other than the Company):

  



  

1.1.1. contact, solicit, divert, induce, call on or attempt to contact,
induce, take away, do business with or otherwise impact the relationship of
the Company, its parent corporation or any of their subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Company Group") with any past, present or prospective
customer (each, a "Customer"). After the Termination Date (as defined below),
past or prospective Customers shall be limited to past or prospective
Customers measured within the two-year period prior to the Termination Date;
or

  



  

1.1.2. employ, hire or engage (or solicit for employment or engagement) any
individual who is employed by the Company Group or has been so employed
within the preceding 12 months, or otherwise encourage or induce any such
individual to discontinue or otherwise alter his or her relationship with the
Company Group.

  



  

1.2.  _Confidentiality_.

  



  

1.2.1. The Executive shall not, during the term of employment and at any time
thereafter, without the prior express written consent of the Company,
directly or indirectly divulge, disclose, or make available or accessible any
Confidential Information (as defined below) to any person, firm, partnership,
corporation, trust, or any other entity or third party (other than when
required to do so in good faith to perform the Executive's duties and
responsibilities or when required to do so by a lawful order of a court of
competent jurisdiction, any governmental authority or agency, or any
recognized subpoena power). In addition, the Executive shall not create any
derivative work or other product based on or resulting from any Confidential
Information (except in the good faith performance of his duties under this
Agreement). The Executive shall also deliver to the Company's designee, no
later than the effective date of any termination of his employment with the
Company for any reason, and without retaining any copies, notes or excerpts
thereof, all materials containing Confidential Information, in whatever form,
that are in the Executive's possession or control.

  



  

   

 | |

1.2.2. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean
all information respecting the business and activities of the Company Group,
including, without limitation, the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the
clients, customers, suppliers, employees, consultants, computer or other
files, projects, products, computer disks or other media, computer
hardware or computer software programs, marketing plans, financial
information, methodologies, know-how, processes, practices,
approaches, projections, forecasts, formats, systems, data gathering methods
and/or strategies of the Company Group. The Executive understands that the
above list is not exhaustive, and that Confidential Information includes other
information that is marked or otherwise identified as confidential or
proprietary, or that would otherwise appear to a reasonable person to be
confidential or proprietary in the context and circumstances in which the
information is known or used. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences,
Confidential Information shall not include any information that is, or
becomes, generally available to the public (unless such availability occurs
as a result of the Executive's breach of this Section or other obligation).
The Executive understands and agrees that Confidential Information developed
by him or her in the course of his or her employment by the Company shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if the Company
furnished the same Confidential Information to the Executive in the first
instance.

  



  

1.2.3. The Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any
Federal or State trade secret law for the Executive's disclosure of a trade
secret that is made in confidence to Federal, State or local government
official or to an attorney provided that such disclosure is: (a) solely for
the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; (b)
made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding,
if such filing is made under seal. If the Executive files a lawsuit for
retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, the
Executive may disclose the trade secret to the Executive's attorney and use
the trade secret information in related court proceedings, provided that the
Executive files any document containing the trade secret information under
seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

  



  

1.3.  _Proprietary Rights_.

  



  

1.3.1. Executive hereby expressly agrees that all research discoveries,

documented), improvements, developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings,
technologies, reports and all similar or related information (whether

Confidential Information and copyrightable works, and similar and related
information (in whatever form or medium), which (a) either (i) relate to the
Company Group's actual or anticipated business, research and development or
existing or future products or services, or (ii) result from or are suggested
by any work performed by the Executive for the Company Group; and (b) are
conceived, developed, made or contributed to in whole or in part by the
Executive during his employment ("Work Product") shall be and remain the
sole and exclusive property of the Company.

  



  

1.3.2. Executive acknowledges that, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Company, all Work Product eligible for any form of copyright, trademark or
patent protection made or contributed to in whole or in part by Executive

hire" and shall be owned by the Company.

1.3.4. At the request of the Company, at all times during Executive's
employment with the Company and thereafter, Executive will promptly and fully
assist the Company in effecting the purpose of the foregoing assignment,

documents necessary to secure for the Company such Proprietary Rights and
other rights to all Work Product and all confidential information related
thereto, providing cooperation and giving testimony.

  



  

1.4.  _Non-Disparagement._ The Executive will not disparage the Company
Group, nor any of their products, services, officers, employees, directors,
investors, agents or customers, nor take any action that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the reputation of any such products, service or
persons. Similarly, the Company will direct its officers and directors to
refrain from disparaging the Executive or otherwise taking any action that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the personal or professional
reputation of the Executive. The foregoing will not prohibit any person from
testifying truthfully in any judicial, administrative or regulatory
proceeding.

  



  

1.5.  _Cooperation_. During Executive's employment and thereafter, Executive
will cooperate with the Company in connection with any action or proceeding
(or any appeal from any action or proceeding) that relates to events occurring
during Executive's employment with the Company. In requesting Executive's
cooperation following any cessation of employment, the Company will attempt
to schedule and limit the need for such cooperation so as not to materially
interfere with Executive's other personal and professional commitments.

  



  

2. Termination.

  



  

2.1.  _Required Notice of Termination_.

  



  

2.1.1. Executive agrees to provide the Company with not less than 180 days'

discretion waive all or part of that Notice Period. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Termination Date" shall mean the day immediately following the
last day of the Notice Period.

  



  

2.1.2. During the Notice Period, the Company may in its discretion require

Executive will remain an employee, will cooperate in the transition of his or
her duties to other Company personnel and will remain bound by all his or her

obligations stated in this Agreement, the Offer Letter, and the Executive's
other duties and obligations (whether pursuant to common law, statute,
contract or otherwise).

  



  

2.1.3. If Executive fails, in whole or in part, to provide the advance notice
of resignation required by this Section and the Company does not waive that
Notice Period or any unexpired portion thereof (the "Remaining Period"), the
Company will continue to pay Executive's base salary for the Remaining Period
and the restrictions contained in this Agreement and the Executive's other
duties and obligations to the Company (whether pursuant to common law,
statute, contract or otherwise) will continue for the duration of the
Remaining Period.

  



  

2.2.  _Resignation from Other Positions_. Upon the occurrence of the

the exclusion of a court of law) to final and binding arbitration in the
State of Delaware in accordance with the then existing rules (the "Rules") of
the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. Claims subject to arbitration ("Arbitrable Claims") include, but are

to, salary, health and welfare benefits, disability benefits, severance pay,

3.1.1. In any arbitration pursuant to this Agreement, (a) discovery shall be
allowed and governed by the Rules, and (b) the award or decision shall be
rendered by a single arbitrator who shall be appointed by mutual agreement of
the parties, provided that such arbitrator is licensed to practice law in the
State of Delaware. In the event of failure of the parties to agree within
thirty (30) days after the commencement of the arbitration proceeding upon
the appointment of the single arbitrator, the single arbitrator shall be
appointed by the AAA in accordance with the Rules. Upon the completion of the
selection of the single arbitrator, an award or decision shall be rendered
within no more than thirty (30) days. The Company shall pay all the AAA
administrative fees and the arbitrator\'s fees and expenses. All other costs

of an employee benefit plan.

  



  

3.1.3. This Agreement is not intended to release any claims that the
Executive is not free to release on his own accord. Executive waives
participation, to the extent permitted by law, in any class or collective
action, as either a class or collective action representative or participant.

  



  

3.1.4. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO ARBITRATION IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AGREES, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF SUCH PARTY'S

PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED BY ARBITRATION AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY OBJECTION SUCH PERSON MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ARBITRATION OR THAT ARBITRATION IS

3.3.  _Remedies_. Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the course of
Executive's service to the Company, Executive will be provided with access to
Confidential Information, and will be provided with the opportunity to develop
relationships with clients, prospective clients, employees and other agents
of the Company Group, and Executive further acknowledges that such
Confidential Information and relationships are extremely valuable assets of
the Company Group in which the Company Group has invested and will continue
to invest substantial time, effort and expense. Accordingly, Executive
acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants and other terms and
conditions of this Agreement are reasonable and reasonably necessary to
protect the legitimate business interest of the Company Group. Further, the
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company Group will have no adequate
remedy at law and would be irreparably harmed in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement by the Executive. The Executive hereby
consents and agrees that the Company shall be entitled to seek, in addition to
other available remedies, a temporary or permanent injunction, specific
performance of each of the terms of this Agreement, or any other equitable
relief against such breach or threatened breach from any court of competent
jurisdiction, without the necessity of showing any actual damages or
that money damages would not afford an adequate remedy, and without the
necessity of posting any bond or other security. The aforementioned equitable
relief shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, legal remedies, monetary
damages, or other available forms of relief.

  



  

4. Miscellaneous.

  



  

4.1.  _Agreement Contingent Upon Closing_. This Agreement will take effect
upon the signing of the Transaction and will be void ab initio if the
Transaction is not completed on or prior to June 15, 2017.

  



  

4.2.  _409A Compliance_. For purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code, each installment payment provided under this Agreement shall be treated
as a separate payment. To the extent any payment hereunder constitutes
"nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A and
the Executive is determined to be a "specified employee" as defined in
Section 409A(a)(2)(b)(i), then such payment or benefit shall not be paid until
the first payroll date to occur following the six-month anniversary of the
Executive's separation from service or, if earlier, on the date of the
Executive's death. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not
warrant the tax treatment of any payment under this Agreement or of any other
compensation payable to Executive.

  



  

4.3.  _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, applied without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

  



  

4.4.  _Severability_. Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be
enforceable only if modified, or if any portion of this Agreement shall be
held as unenforceable and thus stricken, such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remainder of this Agreement, the balance of which shall
continue to be binding upon the parties with any such modification to become a
part hereof and treated as though originally set forth in this Agreement. The
parties further agree that any arbitrator (or court in the event of a
proceeding for injunctive relief or with respect to Excluded Claims) is
expressly authorized to modify any such unenforceable provision of this
Agreement in lieu of severing such unenforceable provision from this Agreement
in its entirety. The parties expressly agree that this Agreement, as so
modified, shall be binding upon and enforceable against each of them.

  



  

4.5.  _Waiver_. The failure of any party hereto at any time to require the
performance by any other party hereto of any provision hereof shall in no way
affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor
shall the waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereof be
taken or held to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of such provision or a
waiver of the provision itself or a waiver of any other provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

4.6.  _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement is personal to the Executive
and shall not be assignable by the Executive. The Company may assign its
rights under this Agreement to any purchaser of substantially all the assets
of the Company or of the business unit within the Company in which the
Employee works. For avoidance of doubt, each of the members of the Company
Group is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

  



  

4.7.  _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise
than by a written agreement executed by the Executive and a duly authorized
officer of the Company.

  



  

4.8.  _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be given by hand-delivery to the other party by reputable
overnight courier, by facsimile or registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid. Notices to Company shall be sent to the
Company's principal place of business, to the attention of its Director of
Human Resources. Notices to the Executive shall be sent to the most recent
residential address contained in the Executive's personnel file.

  



  

4.9.  _Prior Agreements_. Executive represents and warrants to the Company
that there are no restrictions, agreements or understandings whatsoever to
which Executive is a party that would prevent or make unlawful Executive's
execution of this Agreement or Executive's employment hereunder.

(i.e., the price a third party buyer is willing to pay for such assets in an
arm's length transaction) of such Person will exceed the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liability on the existing debts (whether matured
or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent) of
such Person as they become absolute and matured; (ii) the sum of the debts
(whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or
contingent) of such Person will not exceed all of the property of such Person
at a fair valuation; (iii) the assets of such Person do not constitute
unreasonably small capital for such Person to carry on its businesses as now
conducted or proposed to be conducted; and (iv) such Person does not intend
to, and does not believe that it will, incur debts or liabilities beyond such
Person's ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of contingent obligations
outstanding at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in the light of
all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount
that is reasonably expected to become an actual or matured liability.

  



  

To the extent that the Company is not or would not be Solvent at such time,
the Company shall not be obligated to pay such Additional Consideration
Payment on its Payment Date. If Parent or Company asserts hereunder that the
Company is not Solvent, Parent shall provide to Restricted Person (from time
to time upon Restricted Person's request) (x) a certification by
Parent's Board of Directors that the Company is not Solvent, and (y) all
information and data, and copies of applicable books and records, to
reasonably support such certification. Such Additional Consideration Payment
(together with interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points)
shall be paid on the Payment Date in the next calendar month in which the
Company is Solvent and would be Solvent following payment of such Additional
Consideration Payment and the Additional Consideration Payment otherwise due
on such Payment Date; _provided, however_ , that payment of such Additional
Consideration Payment must nevertheless be made by the Company on March 15 of
the succeeding year after the year of the applicable deferral of payment of
such Additional Consideration Payment, unless, on such date and assuming
payment of such applicable Additional Consideration Payment, (i) the Company
is not or would not be Solvent and (ii) delay of the payment of such
Additional Consideration Payment is permitted under Treasury
Regulation 1.409A-3(d) (together, the " _Delay Conditions_ "). Any Additional
Consideration Payment not made on such March 15 date shall be paid (together
with interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 500 basis points) on the Payment
Date in the next calendar month in which the second Delay Condition set forth
above is no longer applicable.

(d) If either (i) any Additional Consideration Payment is not paid in full by
the Company within ninety (90) days after the Payment Date thereof (subject
to Section 4(c) hereof), or (ii) Parent and/or Sponsor breaches any of its
respective obligations to (or for the benefit of) Restricted Person set forth
in that certain Board Agreement executed by the Restricted Person, and such
breach is not cured (to the reasonable satisfaction of Restricted Person)
within ninety (90) days after Restricted Person notifies Parent and/or
Sponsor of such breach (each event set forth in clause (i) or clause (ii)
hereof, an " _ACP Default_ "), the Restricted Person's obligations set forth
in Sections 2 and 3 hereof (and the Restricted Period) shall terminate and be
of no further force or affect automatically and without any further action by
(or on behalf of) the Restricted Person. Parent and the Company acknowledge
and agree that the remedies of the Restricted Person set forth in this Section
4(d) are not exclusive, and shall be in addition to any and all other rights
and remedies that Restricted Person may have at law or in equity in
connection with an ACP Default.

  



  

(e) Restricted Person hereby grants an option to the Company to purchase
Restricted Person's undivided one-half interest in the option to purchase
furniture, unattached fixtures, livestock, equipment and real property owned
by Mingus Mountain Estate Residential Center, Inc. ("MMERCI") under
paragraphs 7 and 8 of Section 6.0 of that certain First Amended and
Restated Management Service Agreement dated July 1, 2014, between Sequel
Youth Services of Arizona, L.L.C. and MMERCI (the "Option") at a purchase
price of One Dollar ($1.00) upon the payment in full of all amounts payable by
the Company to Restricted Person under the terms of this Agreement. The
option granted by Restricted Person to Company hereunder shall terminate in
the event of an ACP Default by the Company and shall expire if not exercised
within one hundred eighty (180) days of satisfaction of the entire amount of
the Company's payment obligations of the Additional Consideration hereunder.
In no event shall the Restricted Person cause or permit to occur any
transfer, conveyance, assignment or other disposition of such Option, or any
lien or encumbrance to be placed on such Option, or any termination, waiver
or amendment of such Option or any term or condition with respect
thereto, until such time that the Company's option to purchase the Option is
terminated or expires. In addition, Restricted Person hereby grants a power
of attorney to the Company to exercise all rights of Restricted Person under
the Option until such time that the option granted to the Company hereunder
terminates or expires; provided, however, that upon an exercise of the
Option by the Company pursuant to this power of attorney, the Restricted
Person shall hold the property subject to the Option in trust for the benefit
of the Company until such time that the Company's option to purchase the
Option is terminated or expires or the option to purchase the Option is
exercised in accordance with the terms hereof upon full payment of all
Additional Consideration due to the Restricted Person hereunder, in which
case the Restricted Person shall transfer the property subject to the
Option upon exercise of the option granted hereunder by the Company. Such
power of attorney is irrevocable and the parties hereto agree that the grant
of such power of attorney is coupled with an interest. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that the Company exercises the Option pursuant to the
power of attorney granted hereunder and there is a subsequent ACP Default, the
Company shall thereupon transfer the property subject to the Option purchased
by virtue of the exercise of the Option to the Restricted Person.

5.  _Acknowledgements_. In furtherance of the Restricted Person's obligations
hereunder, the Restricted Person acknowledges and agrees that:

  



  

(a) the Company is currently engaged in the highly competitive Business;

  



  

(b) this Agreement is intended to protect the Parent's investment in the
Company and the goodwill of the Business and is being entered into in
consideration for the various rights being granted under, and ancillary to,
the Merger Agreement;

  



  

(c) the Restricted Person has carefully read and considered this Agreement
and understands the terms and conditions hereof and agrees that they are
necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of Parent's investment in
the Company and the goodwill of the Business;

  



  

(d) the restrictions herein are reasonable in duration, geographic area and
scope and subject matter and are properly required for the adequate
protection of the businesses of Parent, the Company and each of their
respective Subsidiaries;

  



  

(e) the Restricted Person is not now subject to any covenant against
competition or similar covenants or any governmental order or legal
requirement that would affect Restricted Person's performance of the
obligations of this Agreement; and

  



  

(f) the Restricted Person has had the opportunity to review this Agreement
with legal counsel of his choosing and has not relied on any statements made
by Parent, the Company or its legal counsel as to the meaning of any term or
condition contained herein or in deciding whether to enter into this
Agreement, and is entering into this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily.

  



  

6.  _Enforcement_. The Restricted Person acknowledges that if the Restricted
Person were to breach any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement the
damage to the Company and its Subsidiaries would be irreparable. The
Restricted Person therefore agrees that Parent and the Company shall, in
addition to any other remedies available to each of them, be entitled to seek
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened
breach by the Restricted Person of any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Accordingly, the Restricted Person agrees to waive the claim or
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law and agrees in any such action
or proceeding not to (a) interpose the claim or defense that such remedy
exists at law, or (b) require Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to show that monetary damages cannot be measured. The Restricted Person also
acknowledges that the remedies afforded Parent, the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 6_ are not exclusive.

  



  

7.  _Severability_. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the
determination will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or
geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to modify or replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. The parties further
agree that if any part of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in whole
or in part by reason of any rule of law or public policy, and cannot be
modified in accordance with this _Section 7_ , such part shall be deemed to
be severed from the remainder of this Agreement for the purpose only of
the particular legal proceedings in question, and such holding shall not
affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

8.  _Waiver_. The failure of any party hereto at any time to require the
performance by any other party hereto of any provision hereof shall in no way
affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor
shall the waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereof be
taken or held to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of such provision or a
waiver of the provision itself or a waiver of any other provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

9.  _Entire Agreement; Modifications_. This Agreement constitutes the entire
and final expression of the agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended
or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the
Restricted Person and a duly authorized officer of the Company.

  



  

10.  _Relevant Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
the conflict of laws principles thereof. The parties hereto (a) all agree that
any action, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any
way to, this Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware lacks jurisdiction, then in the applicable Delaware state court), or
if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction of such action is vested in the
federal courts, then the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, and irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and venue, which
jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusive, and (b) waive any objection to
such exclusive jurisdiction and venue or that such courts represent an
inconvenient forum. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD TO CLAIMS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY AS TO THE MAKING, EXISTENCE, VALIDITY, OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

  



  

11.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile, portable
document format (PDF), and electronic transmission and in counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but both of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

12.  _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other party.

  



  

13.  _Agreement Contingent Upon Closing_. This Agreement shall terminate at
such time, if any, that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms.

Re:  _Board Agreement_

  



  

Jay:

  



  

Reference is made to that certain agreement and plan of merger (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), by and among Global Partner Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Global Partner Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Parent Sponsor_ "), Sequel Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, Sequel
Youth and Family Services, LLC, an Iowa limited liability company (the "
_Company_ "), the Key Equityholders identified therein and you, as the
Securityholder Representative identified therein. In order to induce you and
the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed to enter
into this letter agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") relating to your position
on the Board of Directors of Parent, on the terms and subject to the
conditions specified herein. This letter represents the "Board Agreement"
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Merger Agreement.

  



  

Parent hereby agrees with you as follows:

  



  

1. You will be nominated by Parent as the Chair of the Board of Directors of
Parent in the Proxy Statement prepared and filed by Parent with the SEC.

  



  

2. For so long as you are a member of the Board of Directors of Parent,
Parent shall pay you an annual payment of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000.00) (payable quarterly in arrears, on the last Business Day of each
calendar quarter). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall guarantee you any particular position or any position on the
Board of Directors of Parent.

  



  

3. You shall be entitled to the same exculpation from liability and
indemnification and expense advance rights as available to any other director
of the Parent on the date hereof and, if such rights are amended to be more
favorable to any director, you shall also receive such additional rights. In
furtherance of the foregoing, you will participate in any directors and
officers insurance policy available to any director and Parent shall enter
into an indemnification agreement with you in the form of Parent's current
form of indemnification agreement filed with the SEC on Form S-1/A on July 13,
2015.

  



  

4. This Agreement constitutes the entire and final expression of our
agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements between us with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written
agreement executed by you and a duly authorized officer of Parent.

  



  

5. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests,
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
party.

  



  

6. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of laws
principles thereof. The parties hereto (a) all agree that any action,
proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to, this
Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks
jurisdiction, then in the applicable Delaware state court), or if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction of such action is vested in the federal
courts, then the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
and irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and venue, which jurisdiction and
venue shall be exclusive, and (b) waive any objection to such exclusive
jurisdiction and venue or that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

7. This Agreement shall terminate at such time, if any, that the Merger
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) of Parent Common Stock;

  



  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Sponsor and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of January 11, 2017, by and among

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  



  

Article I

  

 _Certain Definitions_

Parent in connection with the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (c) the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in each case, with
respect to all of the shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding on the record

Expiration Date, Sponsor further agrees that at any meeting of the
securityholders of Parent, however called, and any adjournment or
postponement thereof or in any other circumstances upon which a vote or other
approval with respect to the Merger and the Merger Agreement is sought,
Sponsor shall vote (or cause to be voted) all of the shares of Parent Common

exercise all voting and other rights of Sponsor with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement and approving
(a) the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (b) the Required Approval Matters

not enter into any agreement or understanding with any Person to vote or give

2.3.  _Additional Purchases_. Sponsor agrees that in the event that (a) any
shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities of Parent are issued
to Sponsor after the date of this Agreement pursuant to any stock dividend,
stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or exchange of
shares of Parent Common Stock of, on, or affecting the Parent Common Stock
Owned by Sponsor or otherwise, (b) Sponsor purchases or otherwise acquires
beneficial ownership of any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity

_New Shares_ "), then Sponsor agrees to vote (or cause to be voted) such New
Shares (to the extent applicable) in the same manner as the Parent Common
Stock Owned by Sponsor. Sponsor also agrees that any New Shares acquired or
purchased by Sponsor shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement to the
same extent as if they constituted the Parent Common Stock Owned by Sponsor.

the extent and for the duration that such terms remain in effect at the time
of the transfer.

properties is or may be bound or affected; or (B) result in or constitute
(with or without notice or lapse of time) any breach of or default under, or
give to any other Person (with or without notice or lapse of time) any
right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
(with or without notice or lapse of time) in the creation of any Lien on any

(ii) As of the date of this Support Agreement, the execution and delivery of

against whom enforcement is sought.

  



  

4.2.  _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations,

4.4.  _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

       | Re:   | _Agreement Relating to Founder Shares_ 
---|---|--- 
    



  

Gentlemen:

  



  

Reference is made to that certain agreement and plan of merger (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), by and among Global Partner Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Global Partner Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Parent Sponsor_ "), Sequel Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, Sequel
Youth and Family Services, LLC, an Iowa limited liability company (the "
_Company_ "), the Key Equityholders identified therein and the Securityholder
Representative identified therein. In order to induce the Company to enter
into the Merger Agreement, Parent Sponsor has agreed to enter into this letter
agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") relating to the forfeiture and/or
restriction on certain of the equity of Parent held by Parent Sponsor, on the
terms and subject to the conditions specified herein. This letter represents
the "Founder Share Letter Agreement" contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

Parent Sponsor hereby agrees with the Company and Parent as follows:

  



  

1. Parent Sponsor agrees that it shall not Transfer (as defined below)
2,328,750 of the shares of Common Stock of Parent, par value $0.0001 per
share (the " _Common Stock_ "), held by Parent Sponsor (" _Founder Shares_
") until the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Lock-up
Period_ ").

  



   | a.| " _Transfer_ "  shall mean the (i) sale of, offer to sell,
contract or agreement to sell, hypothecate,  pledge, grant of any option to
purchase or otherwise dispose of or agreement to dispose  of, directly or
indirectly, or establishment or increase of a put equivalent position  or
liquidation with respect to or decrease of a call equivalent position within
the meaning  of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
of the U.S. Securities  and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder with
respect to, any security, (ii) entry  into any swap or other arrangement that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, any  of the economic consequences
of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction  is to be settled
by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or (c) public 
announcement of any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause
(a) or  (b). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   



 

    



   | b.| Notwithstanding  the provisions set forth in paragraph 1 above,
Transfers of the Founder Shares are permitted  (i) to Parent Sponsor's
officers or directors, any affiliates or family members  of any of Parent
Sponsor's officers or directors, any members of Parent Sponsor  or any
affiliates of Parent Sponsor or any of its members; (ii) in the case of an 
individual, by a gift to a member of one of the members of the individual's
immediate  family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of one
of the individual's  immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a
charitable organization; (iii) in  the case of an individual, by virtue of
laws of descent and distribution upon death of  the individual; (iv) in the
case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic  relations order; and
(v) by virtue of the laws of Delaware or Parent Sponsor's  limited liability
company agreement upon dissolution of Parent Sponsor; _provided_ , _however_
,  that in the case of clauses (i) through (iv), these permitted transferees
must enter  into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these Transfer
restrictions. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

2. Parent Sponsor agrees that 1,552,500 of its Founder Shares (the " _Earnout
Shares_ ") shall be subject to forfeiture on the eight-year anniversary of
the Effective Time, with no further action required of any Person, unless
such Earnout Shares have vested as set forth below in this _Section 2_. Upon
any such forfeiture, Parent Sponsor shall transfer to Parent for cancellation
and in exchange for no consideration, such applicable portion of the Earnout
Shares. From the Effective Time through the eight-year anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Earnout Shares will vest and no longer be subject to
forfeiture as follows:

  



   | a.| 776,250  of the Earnout Shares will vest and no longer be subject
to forfeiture upon the first  day that the last sale price of the Common
Stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as  adjusted for stock splits,
dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like)  for any twenty
(20) trading day period in a thirty (30) day trading period immediately 
preceding such day; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b.| 776,250  of the Earnout Shares will vest and no longer be subject
to forfeiture upon the first  day that the last sale price of the Common
Stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share (as  adjusted for stock splits,
dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like)  for any twenty
(20) trading day period in a thirty (30) day trading period immediately 
preceding such day; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | c.| all  of the Earnout Shares will vest and no longer be subject to
forfeiture upon a Change  of Control. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

For purposes of this _Section 2_ , " _Change of Control_ " means the
occurrence of any of the following events after the date hereof:

  



   | (i)| there  is consummated, in accordance with Parent's certificate
of incorporation and applicable  law, the sale, lease or transfer, in one or
a series of related transactions, of all  or substantially all of Parent's
assets (determined on a consolidated basis), including  a sale of all Class A
Common Units of the Company held by Parent, to any Person or "group"  (as
such term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, or any successor
provisions  thereto); 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | -2-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



   | (ii)| any  Person or any group of Persons acting together which would
constitute a "group"  for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act,
or any successor provisions thereto,  is or becomes the beneficial owner,
directly or indirectly, of securities of Parent representing  more than fifty
percent (50%) of the combined voting power of Parent's then outstanding 
Common Stock; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| there  is consummated a merger or consolidation of Parent with
any other corporation or other  entity, and, immediately after the
consummation of such merger or consolidation, either  (x) the Board of
Directors of Parent immediately prior to the merger or consolidation  does
not constitute at least a majority of the board of directors of the Person
surviving  the merger or, if the surviving Person is a Subsidiary, the
ultimate parent thereof,  or (y) the Common Stock immediately prior to such
merger or consolidation do not continue  to represent or are not converted
into more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined  voting power of then
outstanding voting securities of the Person resulting from such  merger or
consolidation or, if the surviving Person is a Subsidiary, the ultimate
parent  thereof; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| the  stockholders of Parent and the Board of Directors of
Parent approve a plan of complete  liquidation or dissolution of Parent. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except with respect to clause (iii)(x) above,
a "Change of Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred by virtue of the
consummation of any transaction or series of integrated transactions
immediately following which (A) the record holders of the shares of Common
Stock of Parent immediately prior to such transaction or series of
transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate ownership
in, and own substantially all of the shares of, an entity which owns all or
substantially all of the assets of Parent immediately following such
transaction or series of transactions or (B) Parent is the surviving
entity and its shares of Common Stock continue to be registered under Section
12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and continue to be publicly traded.

  



  

3. Parent hereby agrees to record the aggregate fair value of any Earnout
Shares forfeited hereunder and reacquired to treasury stock and a
corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital based on the difference
between the fair market value of the forfeited shares and the pro-rata
portion of the price paid to Parent for such forfeited shares of approximately
$15,515,000. Upon receipt, such forfeited shares would then be immediately
cancelled, which would result in the retirement of the treasury stock and a
corresponding charge to additional paid-in capital.

  



  

4. Parent Sponsor agrees that 7,532,000 warrants (" _Founder Warrants_ ") to
purchase 3,766,000 shares of Common Stock shall be forfeited as of the
Effective Time, with no further action required of any Person.

  



  

   

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

5. This Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of July 29,
2015 constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto
in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties
hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject
matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by
a written agreement executed by Parent Sponsor, Parent and the Company.

  



  

6. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests,
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto.

  



  

7. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of laws
principles thereof. The parties hereto (a) all agree that any action,
proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to, this
Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
lacks jurisdiction, then in the applicable Delaware state court), or if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction of such action is vested in the federal
courts, then the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
and irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and venue, which jurisdiction
and venue shall be exclusive, and (b) waive any objection to such exclusive
jurisdiction and venue or that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

8. Any notice, consent or request to be given in connection with any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be sent
by electronic mail (with recipient receipt acknowledgment), express mail or
similar private courier service, by certified mail (return receipt
requested), by hand delivery or facsimile transmission.

  



  

9. This Agreement shall terminate at such time, if any, that the Merger
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with any
nonwaivable provision of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in
effect in the State of Delaware, the provisions of Article 8 of the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect in the State of Delaware shall control.

approval of the Managers and (ii) Preferred Member Approval; provided, that
the foregoing limitation shall not be applicable to permitted transferees of
Members who shall be admitted as Members immediately upon compliance with the

XII.

  



  

(b) Subject to the prior receipt of the consent or consents required by

any Interest, now or hereafter to be authorized, or any notes, debentures,
bonds or other securities convertible into or carrying options, warrants or
rights to purchase Units of any class or any other Interest, now or hereafter
to be authorized, whether or not the issuance of any Units or Interest or
such notes, debentures, bonds or other securities would adversely affect the
distribution or voting rights of any such Member.

  



  

3.8  _Resignations_. No Member shall have the right or power to voluntarily
resign or otherwise withdraw from the Company prior to the dissolution and
winding up of the Company, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement.

  



  

3.9  _No Liability of Members_. Except as otherwise expressly required by the
Act, all debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising
in contributions, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations
and liabilities of the Company, and no Member shall be obligated personally

being a Member.

  



  

3.10 _Meetings of and Voting by Members._

  



  

(a) A meeting of the Members may be called at any time by a Majority in
Interest of the Class A Members or by the Board. Meetings of the Members may
be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware that has been
designated in the notice of the meeting or at such place as may be approved
by the Board. Unless such requirement is waived by (i) a Majority in
Interest of the Class A Units and (ii) Preferred Member Approval, meetings of
the Members shall be held upon ten (10) Business Days' notice by first-class
mail or internationally recognized express courier or forty-eight (48) hours'
notice given personally or by telephone, facsimile, e-mail, or other similar
means of communication. Any such notice shall be addressed or delivered to
each Member at such Member's address as it is shown upon the records of the
Company. Notice by mail or express courier shall be deemed to have been given
at the time a written notice is deposited in the United States or Canadian
mail, postage prepaid or at the time deposited with such express courier with
full payment for express delivery, as the case may be. Any other written
notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time it is personally
delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for
transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by
electronic means, to the recipient. Oral notice shall be deemed to have been
given at the time it is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless,
to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person
giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the
receiver. Unless otherwise expressly required by this Agreement, the
affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Class A Units and the Class
C Units, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the approval
by the Members of each matter submitted to a vote of the Members, other than
any Preferred Consent Matter (for which Preferred Member Approval shall be
required).

  



  

   

 | -28-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The presence (in person or by proxy) of Members having sufficient voting
power to approve all matters to be considered at the meeting shall constitute
a quorum. In case a quorum shall not be present at any meeting, Members
holding a majority of the Units present (in person or by proxy) at the
meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a
quorum is present.

  



  

(c) Members may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone
or other communications equipment, so long as all Persons participating in
such meeting can hear each other.

  



  

(d) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Members may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if Members
holding not less than the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize or
take such action as required under this Agreement consent in writing to that
action. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as
a vote taken at a meeting by such Members. Upon the taking of any action by
written consent, the Company shall promptly provide written notice thereof to
the Members that did not execute such written consent; provided that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such action.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this Section 3.10 govern meetings of the Members if the
Members elect, in their discretion, to hold meetings or if a meeting of the
Members is called by the Board. Nothing in this Section 3.10 or in this
Agreement, however, is intended to require that meetings of Members be held
absent such a meeting being called by the Members or the Board.

  



  

3.11  _Remuneration to Members_. Except as otherwise specifically provided by
the Board, no Member (acting solely in the capacity of a Member) is entitled
to remuneration for acting in the Company business.

  



  

3.12  _Members Are Not Agents_. Pursuant to Section 4.1 and the Certificate
of Formation, the management of the Company is vested solely in the Board.
The Members shall have no power to participate in the management of the
Company except as expressly authorized by this Agreement or the Certificate
of Formation. No Member, acting solely in the capacity of a Member, shall be
or act as an agent of the Company nor does any Member, unless expressly and
duly authorized in writing to do so by the Board, have any power or authority
to bind or act on behalf of the Company in any way, to pledge its credit, to
execute any instrument on its behalf, or to render it liable for any purpose.

designation of such Manager's successor, (w) the removal of such Manager in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (x) such Manager's
resignation. A Manager may, but need not be, a Member.

  



  

(b) Any Manager may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
Members and the other Managers, or written notice to the Members if there are
no Managers. The resignation of any Manager shall take effect upon receipt of
that notice or at such later time or upon the happening of the event or
events as shall be specified in the notice. Unless otherwise specified in the
notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

  



  

(c) A Manager may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the
affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Class A Units and the Class
C Units, voting together as a single class.

  



  

(d) Any vacancy occurring in the Managers, for any reason, shall be filled by
the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of the Class A Units and the
Class C Units, voting together as a single class. A Manager elected to fill a
vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor in office.

  



  

4.2 _Meetings of the Board_.

  



  

(a) Meetings of the Board may be called by any Manager. All meetings shall be
held upon at least two (2) Business Days' written notice (with confirmed
receipt). Notice of a meeting need not be given to any Manager who signs a
waiver of notice or a consent to holding the meeting (which waiver or consent
need not specify the purpose of the meeting) or an approval of the minutes
thereof, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting
without protesting, prior to its commencement, the lack of notice to
such Manager. All such waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with
the Company records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Meetings of
the Board may be held at any place within or without the State of Delaware
that has been designated in the notice of the meeting or at such place as may
be approved by the Board. Managers may participate in a meeting through use of
conference telephone, or other communications equipment, so long as all
Managers participating in such meeting can hear each other. Participation in
a meeting in such manner constitutes presence in person at such meeting. The
presence of Managers sufficient to approve a matter pursuant to this
Agreement constitutes a quorum of the Board for the transaction of business
with respect to such matter.

(b) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board may be taken by
the Board without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if such
number of Managers sufficient to approve such action pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement consents thereto in writing. Such action by written consent
shall have the same force and effect as if taken at a meeting of the Board.

  



  

(c) The Company shall reimburse the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by each Manager in connection with attending meetings of the Board.

  



  

4.3  _Board Approval Matters_. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement
(including Section 13.1), the affirmative vote by a simple majority of the
total number of Managers then in office shall be considered the action of the
Board.

  



  

4.4  _Power to Bind Company_. No Manager (acting in his capacity as such)
shall have any authority to bind the Company to any third party with respect
to any action except pursuant to a resolution expressly authorizing such
action which resolution is duly adopted by the Board by the affirmative vote
required for such matter pursuant to this Agreement. Except as otherwise
determined by the Board, only those Managers, officers of the Company, and
other Persons specifically authorized by the Board may execute any contract,
agreement, or document on behalf of the Company.

  



  

4.5 _Fiduciary Duties of Managers_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article IV, the Managers shall
have and exercise the same duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company
and the Members as a director of a corporation under the laws of the State of
Delaware.

  



  

(b) To the extent that the Members, or any Member or class or group of
Members, have a consent, veto or approval right or power under this Agreement
or the Act with respect to a particular matter or action of the Company or the
Board, and such Members, or Member or class or group of Members, (i) give
their consent or approval to such matter or action, then the Managers shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, have no duties (including fiduciary
duties) to the Company, the Members, the other Managers, the officers of the
Company or any other Person in taking such particular matter or action, or
(ii) veto or fail to exercise such right or power with respect to such matter
or action, then the Managers shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
have no duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company, the Members, the
other Managers, the officers of the Company or any other Person in failing to
act with respect to such particular matter or action.

  



  

   

 | -31-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 4.5, to the extent that they restrict or
eliminate or otherwise modify the duties (including fiduciary duties) of the
Managers existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Company, the Members,
the other Manager(s), the officers of the Company and any other Person to
replace such other duties of Managers to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

  



  

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 4.5 shall be
prospective only and shall not in any way affect the elimination or
modification of duties (including fiduciary duties) of the Managers as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to acts or omissions occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when claims relating to such
matters may arise or be asserted.

  



  

4.6  _Other Activities_. Except as expressly otherwise provided herein
(including, without limitation, in the succeeding sentences of this Section
4.6) but (for any Manager) in any event in compliance with the obligations set
forth in Section 4.5(a), any Member and any Manager may engage in or possess
any interest in other business ventures and may engage in other activities
of any nature and description independently or with others and neither the
Company nor any other Member shall have any rights in or to any such
independent venture or the income or profits derived therefrom. The Manager
shall not be required to manage the Company as its sole and exclusive
function. In addition to the activities permitted by the initial sentence of
this Section 4.6, Alaris may engage in or possess any interests in business
ventures and may engage in other activities of every kind and
description (including ventures competitive with the Sequel Group)
independently or with others in addition to those relating to the
Company, provided that Alaris complies with the provisions of Section 7.6.
Each Member authorizes, consents to and approves of such present and future
activities by Alaris. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, any
Member or any officer of the Company shall have any right by virtue of this
Agreement or the relationship created hereby in or to other ventures or
activities of Alaris or any Affiliate of Alaris (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, excludes the Company), or to the income or proceeds derived therefrom.

  



  

4.7  _Devotion of Time_. The Members acknowledge that the Company is managed
on a day-to-day basis by a Chief Executive Officer (other than the Managers)
who is responsible for the day-to-day operational management of the Company at
the direction of the Managers and that the roles of the Managers (acting in
their capacity as such) are to provide strategic direction and
overall control of the business only. As such, a Manager shall not be
required to manage the Company as his sole and exclusive function, provided
that each Manager shall dedicate such time, effort and skill to the planning
for the Company's strategic direction of the business and operational affairs
as is necessary and proper to ensure the Company's welfare and success.

  



  

4.8 _Limited Liability_.

  



  

(a) A Manager shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, not be liable to
the Company, the Members, the other Manager(s), the officers of the Company
or any other Person for breach of fiduciary duty for such Manager's good faith
reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | -32-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) A Manager of the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
not be personally liable under any judgment of a court, or in any other
manner, for any debt, obligation, or liability of the Company, whether that
liability or obligation arises in contract, tort, or otherwise, solely by
reason of being a Manager of the Company.

  



  

(c) A Manager, in the performance of such Manager's duties as set forth in
Section 4.5, shall to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be fully protected
and shall not be liable to the Company, the Members, the other Manager(s), the
officers of the Company or any other Person, in relying in good faith upon
the records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and upon such
information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Company by any
of its other Managers, Members, officers or employees or to any of the
Company's Subsidiaries or any of their managers, directors, officers,
employees or committees of managers or directors, or by any other Person, as
to matters the Manager reasonably believes are within such other Person's
professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable
care by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and
amount of the assets, liabilities, profits or losses of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of
assets from which distributions to Members might properly be paid). In
addition, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Managers may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management
consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisors
selected by them, and a Manager, in the performance of such Manager's duties
as set forth in Section 4.5, shall to the fullest extent permitted by Law be
fully protected, and shall not be liable to the Company, the Members, the
other Manager(s), the officers of the Company or any other Person, in relying
in good faith upon any advice or opinion of any such Person as to matters
which the Managers reasonably believe to be within such Person's professional
or expert competence.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a Manager
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, not be liable to the
Company, the Members, the other Manager(s), the officers of the Company or
any other Person for breach of fiduciary duties as set forth in Section 4.5;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not eliminate or limit the
liability of a Manager for (i) any breach of the Manager's duty of loyalty to
the Company or the Members, (ii) any acts or omissions not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of Law, (iii) any
financial benefit received by the Manager to which the Manager is not
entitled, or (iv) any improper distributions for which the consent related to
such distribution does not comply with the Manager's fiduciary duties set
forth in Section 4.5.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this Section 4.8, to the extent that they restrict or
eliminate or otherwise modify of the liabilities of the Managers existing at
law or in equity, are agreed by the Company, the Members, the other
Manager(s), the officers of the Company and any other Person to replace such
other liabilities of Managers to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

  



  

(f) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 4.8 shall be
prospective only and shall not in any way affect the elimination or
modification of liabilities of the Managers as in effect immediately prior to
such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to acts or omissions
occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when claims relating to such matters may arise or be
asserted.

  



  

   

 | -33-|

4.9  _Officers and Related Persons_. The Board shall have the authority to
appoint and terminate officers of the Company and retain and terminate
employees, agents, advisors, representatives and consultants of the Company
and to delegate such duties to any such officers, employees, agents,
advisors, representatives and consultants as the Board deems appropriate,
including the power, acting individually or jointly, to represent and bind
the Company in all matters, in accordance with the scope of their respective
duties.

  



  

4.10  _Reliance by Third Parties_. Persons dealing with the Company are
entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority of the Board.

  



  

4.11 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Members intend that the Company be treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and any similar provisions of state or local Law.
The Company shall not elect to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation for U.S. federal, state or local income tax purposes under Regs.
§301.7701-3(a) or under any corresponding provision of state or local Law. The
tax classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes, however, shall not
affect the Company's state law status as a Delaware limited liability company
or the status of the Company in any foreign jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) Until the Board determines otherwise, the Parent shall be the person
described in IRC §6231(a)(7) and be referred to as the " _Tax Matters Member_
". As the Tax Matters Member, the Parent shall act in good faith and in a
manner consistent with its fiduciary duties, from time to time, only at the
direction of the Board, which direction shall be given only in good faith and
in a manner consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board. The Tax
Matters Member shall cause to be prepared and shall sign all returns of the
Company, make any election which is available to the Company consistent with
the terms hereof, and monitor any governmental tax authority in any audit
that the authority may conduct of the Company's books and records or other
documents. If a valid Section 754 election is not otherwise already in
effect, the Company shall make and thereafter shall keep in effect, a
valid election under Section 754 of the Code beginning in the taxable year of
the Company that includes the Merger or any Exchange of a Unit constituting a
sale or exchange for federal income tax purposes. Each Member shall take all
actions required to cause the Parent to be (and continue as) the Tax Matters
Member and, if requested by the Tax Matters Member, to otherwise
authorize and appoint the Tax Matters Member as that party with the sole
authority to handle all tax matters of the Company. Each Member agrees to
execute, certify, deliver, file and record at appropriate public offices or
deliver to the Tax Matters Member such documents as may be requested by the
Tax Matters Member to facilitate the handling of any tax matter as the Tax
Matters Member deems necessary. The Tax Matters Member shall keep the Members
reasonably informed of all audit activity or correspondence to and from tax
authorities pertinent to Company affairs, and shall afford any Member
interested in doing so the opportunity to participate in proceedings before a
taxing authority or any judicial proceedings pertinent to tax matters.

  



  

   

 | -34-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Not later than March 15 of each year (or as may be extended in compliance
with the Regs), the Board shall cause to be prepared and transmitted to each
Member a U.S. federal income tax Form K-1 for the prior Tax Year and any
required similar state and local income tax form for each Member prepared in
a manner consistent with the terms hereof.

  



  

(d) The Tax Matters Member shall not cause or permit the Company to take any
action or make any decision that would have a Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse effect on any Member without approval of the Board, and with
respect to any Preferred Member, Preferred Member Approval.

  



  

(e) With respect to Tax returns for Tax years beginning after December 31,
2017 (or such later date as may be applicable if the effective date the 2015
Audit Rules is delayed), the Tax Matters member shall be the Company's
"partnership representative" (as such term is defined in Code §6223(a)) (and
in any other similar capacity under state or local Tax Law). The Tax
Matters Member shall keep the Members reasonably informed of all audit
activity or correspondence to and from Tax authorities pertinent to the
Company's affairs, and shall afford any potentially-affected Member interested
in doing so the opportunity to participate in proceedings before a Tax
authority or any judicial proceedings pertinent to Tax matters, to the extent
practicable, at such Member's own expense. The Tax Matters Member shall not
cause or permit the Company to take any action or make any decision pertinent
to such audit activity that would have a material adverse effect on the
Preferred Member without Preferred Member Approval. Except with Preferred
Member Approval:

  



  

(i) The Tax Matters Member shall not cause or permit the Company to elect
under §1101(g)(4) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 to have any provision
of such Act apply to the Company for the Company's Tax years beginning before
January 1, 2018 (such provisions, the "2015 Audit Rules");

  



  

(ii) The Tax Matters Member shall cause the Company to make an election out
of the 2015 Audit Rules pursuant to Code §§6221(b) if the Company is eligible
to do so unless Company receives written notice to the contrary from the
Preferred Member; and

  



  

(iii) If the Company is not eligible for such election out in (ii) above),
the Company shall make the election described in Code §6226(a), to the extent
the Company is eligible to do so, so as to avoid the application of Code
§6225, unless Preferred Member approves Company's decision not to make such
election.

  



  

Article V

  

 _Contributions and Capital Accounts_

  



  

5.1  _Capital Contributions_. As of the date hereof, each Member shall own
the number and class of Units set forth opposite the name of such Member as
set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, as adjusted from time to time pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. Units have been and shall be hereafter issued to
the Members for the Capital Contributions made by such Members at the time
they received their respective Units.

  



  

   

 | -35-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.2 _Capital Accounts_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall establish and maintain a single Capital Account for
each Member in accordance with the following provisions:

  



  

(i) To each Member's Capital Account there shall be added such Member's
Capital Contributions, such Member's allocable share of Profit, Gross Income,
and any items in the nature of income or gain that are specially allocated
pursuant to Sections 6.4, 6.4 or 6.5 hereof and the amount of any Company
liabilities assumed by such Member or secured by any Property distributed to
such Member;

  



  

(ii) Each Member's Capital Account shall be decreased by the amount of cash
and the Asset Value of any Property distributed to such Member pursuant to
any provision of this Agreement, such Member's allocable share of Losses and
any items in the nature of deduction or loss that are specially allocated
pursuant to Sections, 6.3, 6.4 or 6.5 hereof and the amount of any
liabilities of such Member assumed by the Company or that are secured by any
property contributed by such Member to the Company;

  



  

(iii) In the event all or a portion of an Interest is transferred in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the transferee shall succeed to
the Capital Account of the transferor to the extent it relates to the
transferred Interest; and

  



  

(iv) In determining the amount of any liability for purposes of clauses (i)
and (ii) of this Section 5.2, there shall be taken into account Code §752(c)
and any other applicable provisions of the Code, the Regs and Section 6.7(c)
hereof.

  



  

(b) The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement
relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with
Regs. Section 1.704-1(b), and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner
consistent with such Regs. In the event the Board shall determine that it is
prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any decreases
or increases thereto (including decreases or increases relating to
liabilities that are secured by, contributed or distributed property or that
are assumed by the Company or the Members), are computed in order to comply
with such Regs., the Board may make such modification, provided that it is
not likely to have a material effect on the amounts distributable to any
Member pursuant to Article X upon the winding up of the Company. The Board
also shall (i) make any adjustments that are necessary or appropriate to
maintain equality between the aggregate Capital Accounts of the Members and
the amount of Company capital reflected on the Company's balance sheet, as
computed for book purposes in accordance with Regs. Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(q), and (ii) make any appropriate modifications in the
event unanticipated events might otherwise cause this Agreement not to comply
with Regs. Section 1.704-1(b).

  



  

5.3 _Additional Contributions_.

  



  

(a) No Member shall be obligated to make any additional contribution to the
Company's capital without such Member's consent. The consent of the other
Members is not necessary for any Member to contribute additional capital to
the Company, provided that Preferred Member Approval is required if any such
contribution of additional capital would cause a breach of Article XII.

  



  

   

 | -36-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Members acknowledge that additional capital contributions may be in
the best interest of the Company and its Members from time to time. If the
Board reasonably determines that additional contributions to the Company's
capital are required, the Board may request the capital contributions from
the Preferred Member. The Preferred Member has indicated an interest in
possibly funding additional capital contributions if requested to do so by
the Company. Any additional capital contribution by the Preferred Member is
subject to, among other matters, (i) approval of a Majority in Interest of the
Class A Units, (ii) approval of all corporate and regulatory bodies with
authority over the Preferred Member and its parent entity, (iii) no Material
Adverse Effect or Material Change has occurred as of the closing of such
additional capital contribution, and (iv) no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing as of the closing of such additional capital contribution.

  



  

(c) To the extent a Member makes an additional Capital Contribution to the
Company, the Board shall revise _Exhibit A_ of this Agreement to reflect
such Capital Contribution without further, act, vote or consent of any other
Person, which amendment shall constitute an amendment to this Agreement
permitted by Section 13.1.

  



  

5.4 _Rights Regarding Capital Contributions_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, no Member shall be entitled to
interest on any Capital Contribution, and no Member shall have the right to
withdraw or to demand the return of all or any part of its Capital
Contribution.

  



  

(b) Except as required by the LLC Act, no Member shall have personal
liability for the repayment of the Capital Contribution of any Member or any
obligation to make loans or advances to the Company, including restoration of
a deficit Capital Account as provided in Section 5.5.

  



  

5.5  _Deficit Capital Accounts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, and notwithstanding any custom or rule of Law to
the contrary, to the extent that any Member's Capital Account has a deficit
balance upon dissolution of the Company, such deficit shall not be an asset
of the Company and such Member shall not be obligated to contribute such
amount to the Company to bring the balance of such Member's Capital Account
to zero.

  



  

5.6  _Creditors_. The provisions of this Agreement are intended solely to
benefit the Members and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
shall not be construed as conferring any benefit upon any creditor of the
Company (and no such creditor shall be a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement), and no Member shall have any duty or obligation to any creditor of
the Company to make any contribution or payments to the Company.

  



  

Article VI

  

 _Allocations and Distributions_

  



  

6.1  _Profit and Loss_. The Board will allocate to each Member its share of
the Gross Income, Profit and Loss of the Company for each Tax Year as
determined in accordance with the terms hereof. All Members agree to be bound
by such allocations of Gross Income, Profit, Loss, and all items which are
separately allowable for income tax purposes, tax credits and other income
tax-related amounts provided for in this Agreement, and expressly acknowledge
that such allocations are reasonable having regard to all circumstances at
the time each Member acquired any Units in the Company.

  



  

   

 | -37-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.2  _All Unitholders of Each Class Equal_. Allocations of Gross Income,
Profit, Loss and all items which are separately allowed for income tax
purposes, tax credits and other income tax-related amounts shall be made among
the holders of each class of Units in proportion to which the number of Units
of that class held by a Member bears to the aggregate number of Units in such
class held by all Members.

  



  

6.3  _Allocation of Profit and Gross Income_. At the end of each Tax Year of
the Company, and subject to Sections 6.3(d), 6.4(e) and 6.5, holders of Units
will be allocated an amount of Gross Income and Profit in the following order
of priority:

  



  

(a) First, Gross Income to the Preferred Member to the extent of the lesser
of:

  



  

(i) the aggregate amount of Class C Distribution and Class D Distribution
paid to it during such Tax Year, plus the balance of the Notional Account (as
computed pursuant to Section 6.3(c)), if any; and

  



  

(ii) all of the Company's Gross Income for such Tax Year; and

  



  

(b) Second, all Profit to the holders of the Class A Units and Class B Units
in proportion to the number of Units held by each such holder relative to the
total number of Class A Units and Class B Units outstanding at the end of such
Tax Year.

  



  

(c) In respect of any Tax Year, the amount, if any, by which the amount
referred to in Section 6.3(a)(i) exceeds the amount referred to in Section
6.3(a)(ii), shall be added to a notional account (the " _Notional Account_ ")
for the purpose of calculating the allocation of Gross Income to the
Preferred Member (in proportion to the number of Class C Units and Class D
Units held by such Member) in any subsequent Tax Year. For purposes of
clarity, the purpose of such Notional Account is to ensure that the Preferred
Member is appropriately allocated an aggregate amount of Gross Income equal to
the aggregate amount of Class C Distributions and Class D Distributions. An
amount allocated to the Preferred Member in respect of the Notional Account in
a Tax Year shall be deducted from the Notional Account for the purposes of
subsequent Tax Years (in proportion to the number of Class C Units and Class
D Units held by such Member).

  



  

(d) Upon a Liquidation Event, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, an amount of Profit arising therefrom shall be
allocated to the Preferred Member to the extent of (i) any installments of the
Class C Distribution and Class D Distribution that are due and payable have
not been fully paid, and (ii) the positive difference, if any, between (A) the
Preferred Member\'s Initial Class C Contribution, Initial Class D
Contribution, and any additional amounts to which the Preferred Member is
entitled if Section 8.11 or 8.12 is applicable (such adjustment is limited to
the Profit arising from such event), and (B) the Capital Account balance of
the Preferred Member.

  



  

   

 | -38-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.4  _Allocation of Loss and Related Offsetting Allocations of Profit_. At the
end of each Tax Year, holders of Units will be allocated an amount of Loss in
the following order of priority:

  



  

(a) First, to the holders of Class A Units and Class B Units (in proportion
to the number of Units held by each Member relative to the total number of
Class A Units and Class B Units outstanding at the end of such Tax Year) until
the balances of their Capital Accounts are reduced to zero;

  



  

(b) Second, to the holders of Class A Units and Class B Units (in proportion
to the number of Units held by each Member relative to the total number of
Class A Units and Class B Units outstanding at the end of such Tax Year) until
a holder of Class A Units or Class B Units would have an Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit, and then to the other holders of Class A Units and Class B
Units until each such holder of Class A Units or Class B Units would have an
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.

  



  

(c) Third, to the holder of Class C Units and Class D Units, in proportion to
the weighted average number of such Units held by each such holder during
such Tax Year relative to the weighted average total number of Class C Units
and Class D Units outstanding during such Tax Year, until the balance of its
Capital Account is reduced to zero; and

  



  

(d) Finally, any remaining Loss to the holders of the Class A Units and Class
B Units in proportion to the number of Units held by each Member relative to
the total number of Class A Units and Class B Units outstanding at the end of
such Tax Year.

  



  

(e) In respect of each Tax Year, if, in a prior Tax Year, an amount of Loss
has been allocated to the holders of Class A Units, Class B Units, Class C
Units or Class D Units pursuant to this Section 6.4, which such allocations
have not been reversed by previous applications of this Section 6.4, Profit
in such current Tax Year shall be allocated in the following manner:

  



  

(i) First, to holders to which such Loss has been previously allocated, in
the following order of priority:

  



  

(A) First, Profit to reverse such previous Loss allocations made pursuant to
Section 6.4(d);

  



  

(B) Second, Gross Income to reverse such previous Loss allocation made
pursuant to Section 6.4(c);

  



  

(C) Third, Profit to reverse the Loss allocation made pursuant to Section
6.4(b); and

  



  

(D) Finally, Profit to reverse such previous Loss allocation made pursuant to
Section 6.4(a); and

  



  

(E) Thereafter, the balance of Profit, if any, shall be allocated pursuant to
Section 6.3(a) and (b).

  



  

   

 | -39-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.5  _Special Allocations_. The following special allocations shall, except
as otherwise provided, be made in the following order:

  



  

(a) Any Member who unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or
distribution described in Regs. §1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) which
causes or increases an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit shall be allocated
items of income and gain sufficient to eliminate such increase or negative
balance caused thereby, as quickly as possible, to the extent required by
Regs. §1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). The Members intend that the provisions set forth
in this clause will constitute a "qualified income offset" as described in
Regs. §1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted and applied in all
respects in accordance with such Regs.

  



  

(b) No allocation of an item of Loss shall be made to any Member if, as a
result of such allocation, such Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account
Deficit. Any such disallowed allocation shall be made to the Members entitled
to receive such allocation under Regs. §1.704-1 and otherwise in accordance
with the applicable provisions of Section 6.4. If any item of Loss
is reallocated under this Section 6.5(b), subsequent allocations of Profit
and Loss (and items thereof) shall be made so that, to the extent possible,
the net amount allocated under this Section (b) equals the amount that would
have been allocated to each Member if no reallocation had occurred under this
Section 6.5(b).

  



  

(c) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any of the
Company assets, pursuant to Code § 734(b) or Code § 743(b), is required,
pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) of the
Treasury Regulations, to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to Capital Accounts shall be treated
as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or
loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such gain or loss shall be
specially allocated to the Members in accordance with their interests in the
Company if Section 1.704-(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) of the Treasury Regulations
applies, or to the Member to whom such distribution was made if Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) of the Treasury Regulations applies. Additionally,
the Members intend to restate the Capital Account balances under
circumstances when such restatements are required or permitted under Regs.
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), in which cases the principles referred to in Regs.
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(1) through (4) shall be applied. In the event of
such a restatement, the unrealized gain recognized for book purposes is to be
initially allocated to the Preferred Member to the extent of any remaining
accrued but unpaid Class C Distribution and Class D Distribution as well as
any additional amounts in excess of any Initial Class C Contribution and
Initial Class D Contribution to which the Preferred Member is entitled if
Section 8.11 or 8.12 is then applicable (such adjustment is limited to such
unrealized gain recognized for book purposes), consistent with Section 6.3(d).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, if there is a net
decrease in the Company Minimum Gain (as calculated in accordance with the
principles of Regs. §1.704-2(g)(1)) during any Tax Year, each Member, but only
to the extent required by Regs. §1.704-2(f), shall be specially allocated
items of Company income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent
years) in an amount equal to the portion of such Member's share of the net
decrease in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with
Regs. §1.704-2(g)(2). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be
made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each
Member pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in
accordance with Regs. §§1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j). The Members intend that
this provision comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in such
section of the Regs. and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI (other than
Section 6.5(d) if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain
(calculated in accordance with the principles of Regs. §1.704-2(i)(3)) during
any Tax Year, each Member who has a share of that Member Minimum Gain,
determined in accordance with the principles of Regs. §1.704-2(i)(5), as of
the beginning of such Tax Year, but only to the extent required by Regs.
§1.704-2(i) and not subject to the exceptions set forth in Regs.
§1.704-2(i)(4), shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain
for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to
such Member's share of the net decrease in Member Minimum Gain, determined in
accordance with Regs. §§1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(g)(2). Allocations pursuant
to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts
required to be allocated to each Member pursuant thereto. The items to be so
allocated shall be determined in accordance with, and only to the extent
required by, Regs. §§1.704-2(i) and 1.704-2(j). The Members intend that this
provision comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirements in such Regs.
§704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

  



  

(f) All Nonrecourse Deductions shall be allocated to the Members in the
manner described in Section 6.3(b) above (irrespective of whether Profit is
allocable pursuant to such Section in any particular Tax Year) since, the
Members acknowledge, the Profit allocation therein set forth is a significant
Company item attributable to property securing nonrecourse liabilities within
the meaning of Regs. §1.704-2(e)(2).

  



  

(g) The allocations contained in Sections (a) through (f) (the " _Regulatory
Allocations_ ") are intended to comply with certain requirements of Regs.
§§1.704-1 and 1.704-2. The Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into
account in allocating Profit and Loss and other items of income, gain, loss
and deduction among the Members so that to the extent possible, the aggregate
of (i) the allocations made to each Member under this Agreement other than the
Regulatory Allocations and (ii) the Regulatory Allocations made to each
Member shall equal the net amount that would have been allocated to each
Member had the Regulatory Allocations not occurred. The Board shall take
account of the fact that certain of the Regulatory Allocations will occur at
a period in the future for purposes of applying this Section 6.5(g).

  



  

6.6  _Income Tax Allocations and Allocations Regarding Contributed Property_.
Except as provided in the following sentence, all items of Company income,
loss and deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be allocated
among the Members consistent with the corresponding allocations of Profit,
Loss and other items of income and deduction as described in the foregoing
provisions of this Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each item of
income, gain, loss or deduction attributable to: (a) any Property contributed
to the capital of the Company or (b) any other Property of the Company the
Asset Value of which has been adjusted pursuant to clause (ii) or (iv) of the
definition of Asset Value, shall be allocated among the Members in accordance
with Code §704(c) (or, as determined by the Parent as appropriate, any
provisions contained in the Regs. under Code §704(b) providing for
substantially equivalent treatment) using the remedial method, so as to take
into account the variation, at the time of contribution or adjustment to
Asset Value, between the adjusted basis and Asset Value of such Property,
provided that, with prior Preferred Member Approval, the Parent may select
another reasonable method. Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.6 are solely
for purposes of U.S. federal, state and local taxes, and shall not affect, or
in any way be taken into account in computing, any Member's Capital Account
or share of Profit, Loss, other items, or distributions pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, except that allocations pursuant to this Section
6.5 shall be taken into account in determining the amount of Tax Distributions
paid to the holders of Class A Units and Class B Units pursuant to Section
6.9(a).

  



  

   

 | -41-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.7 _Other Allocation Rules_.

  



  

(a) For purposes of determining the Profit, Loss, or any other items
allocable to any specified period, Profit, Loss and any such other items
shall be determined on a monthly or other basis using any permissible method
under Code §706 and the Regs. thereunder.

  



  

(b) The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the allocations
made by this Article VI, and hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of
this Article VI in reporting their shares of Company income and loss for
income tax purposes.

  



  

(c) In allocating Company liabilities for purposes of Code §752 and the Regs.
promulgated thereunder, the Members acknowledge and agree as follows:

  



  

(i) Recourse liabilities shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with
Regs. §1.752-2. It is acknowledged that the Preferred Member presently bears
no "economic risk of loss" for any recourse liability of the Company or its
Affiliates within the meaning of Regs. §1.752-2, and that the Preferred
Member has no obligation or intention to assume such a risk in the
future. Accordingly, unless the Preferred Member determines to assume such a
risk, no such recourse liabilities shall be allocated to the Preferred
Member.

  



  

(ii) In regards to the allocation of nonrecourse liabilities of the Company
as defined in Regs. §1.752-1(a)(2):

  



  

(A) Any such liability allocable pursuant to Regs. §1.752-3(a)(1) shall be
allocated solely to the Members having a share of the Company Minimum Gain.
It is acknowledged that, at present, the Preferred Member has no share of
Company Minimum Gain.

  



  

(B) A maximum amount of nonrecourse liabilities shall be allocated to Members
to whom taxable gain would be allocated under Code §704(c) (or in the same
manner as Section 704(c) in connection with a revaluation of Company property)
if the Company disposed of property subject to one or more nonrecourse
liabilities of the Company in a taxable transaction in full satisfaction of
such liabilities and for no other consideration pursuant to Regs.
§1.752-3(a)(2), taking into account the method of calculation thereof
prescribed in Section 6.6 above. The Members intend that allocations under
this Section 6.7(c)(ii)(B) shall be made to each Member in an amount that
reflects the ultimate taxable gain that would be recognized by each such
Member after taking into consideration any available reductions to such
Member's allocable share of Company gain as a result of existing basis
adjustments determined under section 743(b) and the regulations thereunder.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Members intend, to the extent consistent with
existing law, all nonrecourse liabilities allocated under this Section
6.7(c)(ii)(B) shall be made to the holders of Class A Units and Class B
Units.

  



  

   

 | -42-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(C) All excess nonrecourse liabilities of the Company within the meaning of
Regs. §1.752-3(a)(3) shall be allocated as follows:

  



  

1\. First, to the Members in an amount up to the built-in gain that is
allocable to the Class A Members and the Class B Members, to the
extent consistent with existing law, on §704(c) property or property for
which reverse section §704(c) allocation is applicable where such property is
subject to the nonrecourse liability to the extent that such built-in gain
exceeds the amount described in Section 6.7(c)(ii)(B) above. The Parties
agree that, at the time this Agreement is entered into, there was
sufficient built-in gain allocable to the Class A Members and Class B Members
to support the allocation of the debt to the Class A Members and Class B
Members. The Members intend that allocations under this provision will be made
solely to the Class A Members and the Class B Members, to the extent
consistent with existent law, in a manner similar to that described in Section
6.7(c)(ii)(B), and

  



  

2\. Second, any remaining excess nonrecourse liabilities shall be allocated
solely to the Class A Members and Class B Members in the manner in which
Profit is allocable to such Members pursuant to Section 6.3(b), to the extent
such allocation is consistent with existing law. The Members intend that this
allocation of remaining excess nonrecourse liabilities reflects the manner in
which a significant item of Company income or gain is allocated, as
contemplated in Regs. §1.752-3(a)(3).

  



  

(iii) The foregoing is intended to effectuate the agreement of the Members
that no nonrecourse liabilities will be allocated to the Preferred Member for
purposes of §752 of the Code. If statutory or regulatory changes following the
execution hereof require such an allocation under the terms of this
Agreement, then the Members shall adopt such amendments hereto as may be
proposed by the Preferred Member which are reasonably designed to further
such intent and which will not substantially alter the interests of the
Members in Free-Cash Flow or Liquidation Event Proceeds.

  



  

6.8 _Class C Distributions and Class D Distributions_.

  



  

(a) All Class C Distributions shall be paid to the holder of the outstanding
Class C Units in immediately available funds in equal installments on the
15th day of each calendar month during the applicable distribution period (or
if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), on a
pari passu basis with the Class D Units but in priority to all other
distributions to Members.

  



  

(b) All Class D Distributions shall be paid to the holder of the outstanding
Class D Units in immediately available funds in equal installments on the
15th day of each calendar month during the applicable distribution period (or
if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), on a
pari passu basis with the Class C Units but in priority to all other
distributions to Members.

  



  

   

 | -43-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) When appropriate financial information is not yet available in order to
calculate Same Program Revenues or any year-over-year percentage change
thereto for the purposes of any determination of the Class C Distribution or
Class D Distribution for any Distribution Period, then the Class C
Distribution amount and Class D Distribution amount for such Distribution
Period shall initially be paid at the amount calculated for the immediately
preceding Distribution Period. Following the availability of such
financial information and the calculation of the Class C Distribution amount
and Class D Distribution amount for the then-current applicable Distribution
Period, any deficiency resulting from an increase in the Class C Distribution
or Class D Distribution for the then-current Distribution Period shall be
paid by the Company not later than October 15th of the then-current
Distribution Period (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next
succeeding Business Day), and any overpayment resulting from a decrease in
the Class C Distribution or Class D Distribution for the then-current
Distribution Period shall be credited against the next monthly Class C
Distribution or Class D Distribution payment (or payments), respectively,
until the full amount of any over-payment is recouped by the Company.

  



  

(d) If for any Tax Year, the aggregate Class C Distribution and the aggregate
Class D Distribution paid in respect of such year exceeds the Gross Income
allocable to the Class C Units or the Class D Units, respectively, any such
excess shall reduce the Capital Account of the Preferred Member on a dollar
for dollar basis.

  



  

(e) Distributions to the Preferred Member pursuant to this Section 6.8 and
Section 6.9 shall not be treated as "guaranteed payments" as defined in
§707(c) of the Code.

  



  

6.9 _Common Distributions and Liquidation Event Proceeds_. Except for the
Class C Distribution and the Class D Distribution, which shall be distributed
at such times and in such amounts as set forth in accordance with Section 6.8,
so long as at the time of distribution (i) all installments of the Class C
Distribution and Class D Distribution then due and payable have been paid in
full, (ii) there is no continuing Event of Default, and (iii) no such
distribution as provided herein would cause an Event of Default, then amounts
shall be distributed in respect of the Class A Units and Class B Units in
the manner set forth in this Section 6.9. For the avoidance of doubt,

  



  

(a) unless (and then, to the extent permitted) the Board reasonably
determines in good faith that such distribution shall violate the Act or any
agreement of the Company with any lenders, the Company shall distribute to the
extent of available cash to each of the Class A and Class B Members as soon
as practicable after the close of each Fiscal Year (and at such earlier times
and in such amounts as necessary to enable the Members to pay estimated
income tax liabilities) an amount equal to the excess of (i) the product of
(A) such percentage as the Board shall reasonably determine to represent the
highest combined maximum marginal federal, state and local income tax rates
applicable to any Member or, in the case of a Member that is a tax partnership
or S corporation for federal income tax purposes, to any direct or indirect
member of such Member for such Fiscal Year, multiplied by (B) the net
taxable income for such Fiscal Year allocated to such Member pursuant to
_Sections 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5_ , reduced by the net taxable losses for all prior
Fiscal Years (since the Effective Date, to the extent not previously taken
into account) allocated to such Member pursuant to _Section 6.5_, less (ii)
the aggregate amount of any other distributions made by the Company to
such Member pursuant to _Section 6.9_ in such Fiscal Year. In determining
the amount of distributions pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)_, items of
depreciation or amortization resulting from (x) any special basis adjustment
with respect to any Member pursuant to Sections 734(b), 743(b) and/or 754 of
the Code, or (y) any allocations required by Sections 704(c) and 737 of the
Code shall not be taken into account. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure the Company holds sufficient cash for the
lawful payment of Tax Distributions, including the creation and maintenance
of reasonable and prudent reserves. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not make any distributions pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)_ in
respect of any income or gain arising before the Effective Date (and for the
avoidance of doubt, no distributions shall be made with respect to sale and
contributions of stock of Sequel Camelot Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries
and affiliates). Amounts distributed pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a) _shall
be treated as an advance of amounts to be distributed pursuant to _Sections
6.9(b)_ and/or 6.9 _(c),_ as applicable, and shall be offset against amounts
due to be distributed pursuant to _Sections 6.9(b)_ and/or _6.9(c)_. (the "
_Tax Distributions_ ").

  



  

   

 | -44-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Other Distributions to Members_. Subject to the payment of the Tax
Distributions, cash distributions may be distributed in respect of the Class
A Units and Class B Units, pro rata, at such times as the Board may determine.

  



  

(c) _Distributions Upon Liquidation Event_. All Liquidation Event Proceeds
shall be distributed no later than thirty (30) days after actual
receipt thereof by the Company, in each case to the Members in the following
order and priority:

  



  

(i) First, if any installments of the Class C Distributions and Class D
Distributions that are due and payable have not been fully paid, then one
hundred percent (100%) to the Preferred Member until all such unpaid
installments are fully paid;

  



  

(ii) Second, one hundred percent (100%) to the Preferred Member until the
Preferred Member has received, in the aggregate, an amount which is equal to
the Initial Class C Contribution and the Initial Class D Contribution;

  



  

(iii) Third, one hundred percent (100%) to the Class A Members and the Class
B Members, in proportion to the relative number of Class A Units and Class B
Units, respectively, held by each such Member.

  



  

(d) _Distributions After Change of Control of the Company._ After a Change of
Control of the Company, and the Preferred Member has been redeemed pursuant
to Section 8.12 hereof, any remaining cash, less any amounts reserved in the
discretion by the Board, shall be distributed in respect of the Class A Units
and Class B Units, pro rata, at such times as the Board may determine.

  

 _ _

  

6.10  _Withholding_. All amounts withheld pursuant to the Code or any
provision of any state, foreign or local tax Law with respect to any
distribution or allocation by the Company shall be treated as amounts
distributed to the Members pursuant to this Article VI for all purposes under
this Agreement.

  



  

(a) Unless otherwise required by Law, all amounts due pursuant to this
Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for Taxes.
Each Member shall deliver to the Company a properly completed and executed
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or applicable W-8 (or any successor form)
and any other similarly required documents for State withholding tax purposes.

  



  

   

 | -45-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If and to the extent the Company withholds pursuant to this Section 6.10,
the Company agrees that it will annually provide the Members with evidence of
payment of withholding taxes.

  



  

(c) To the extent any amount withheld with respect to a Member pursuant to
this _Section 6.10_ for any Fiscal Year exceeds the amount distributable to
such Member pursuant to _Section 6.8 or 6.9_, as applicable, for such Fiscal
Year, such Member shall repay such excess to the Company within ten (10)
calendar days after such Member receives written notice from the Company of
the amount of such excess. If the Company itself pays any amount in respect of
such withholding on account of a Member, such Member shall on demand
reimburse the Company for such amount, plus interest thereon at the Applicable
Federal Rate, compounding semi-annually for the month in which such demand is
made.

  



  

(d) Any payment of tax (including penalties and interest) by the Company
pursuant to Code Sections 6225, 6232 and/or 6233 shall be treated as a
payment made by the Company pursuant to a withholding tax obligation, and
shall be allocated amongst the Members as a deemed distribution to such
Members at such time, whether or not such Members were Members in the year to
which the tax payment pertains. If any such payment is reduced based on the
tax attributes of a Member, the Tax Matters Member shall allocate such payment
among the Members to take such reduction into account for the applicable
Members.

  



  

6.11  _No Right to Demand Distributions_. No Member shall be entitled to, be
paid, or have the right to demand distributions of any amount, except as
expressly provided in this Article VI.

  



  

6.12  _Limitation on Distributions_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make a
distribution to the Members on account of their Interest in the Company if
such distribution would violate the Act or any other federal or state Law.

  



  

Article VII

7.1  _Accounting Policies_. All material accounting policies and procedures

Approval as provided in this Agreement shall be applied retroactively to the
date of the Initial Class C Contribution.

  



  

7.2  _Appointment of Auditors_. The Company will retain the Auditors to

(e) The Board will promptly notify the Preferred Member of the occurrence of

the same degree of care (and in no event less than reasonable care) that such
Member uses to protect its own confidential information; provided, that such
Member may (a) disclose such information to legal counsel, consultants,
financial advisors, professionals advising it on matters relating to this
Agreement and the Related Agreements, lenders and investment bankers where (i)
such disclosure is related to the performance of obligations under this
Agreement or any Related Agreement or the consummation of transactions
contemplated hereunder or thereunder and (ii) such Member informs each Person
to which it is making such disclosure that the disclosed information is
confidential, instructs such Person to keep such information confidential and
not disclose such information to any third party (other than those persons to

in connection with the Transfer of any Interest if such Member's transferee
agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions hereof. In addition,
confidential information shall not include information that (x) is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of any disclosure or
other action or inaction by such Member or anyone to whom such Member or any
of its representatives transmits or has transmitted any information, (y) is
or becomes known or available to such Member on a non-confidential basis from
a source (other than any member of the Sequel Group), or (z) was
independently developed by such Member, provided such independent
development can reasonably be proven by the Member's written records. The
Company shall require each Class A Member and Class B Member who requests
information required to be kept confidential pursuant to this Section 7.6 to

required to sign an acknowledgment that provides notice of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 7.8 prior to receiving copies of or access to such

while such Affiliate holds the Units, unless such requirement is waived by
Preferred Member Approval;

  



  

(b) such Affiliate will remain an Affiliate of such transferor Member at all

 | -52-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.10 _Further Restrictions on Transfer_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Transfer of any Unit shall be made (and no purported Transfer shall be
deemed effective for any purpose or vest any rights in the proposed
transferee) if the Transfer would:

  



  

(i) violate any applicable U.S. federal, state or other securities Law or the
rules, regulations or policies of the securities regulatory authorities or
any other governmental authorities with jurisdiction over the Transfer;

  



  

(ii) result in the Company being treated as an association taxable as a
corporation for United States Tax purposes;

  



  

(iii) adversely affect the Company's existence or qualification as a limited
liability company under any applicable U.S. federal, state or local Law;

  



  

(iv) result in any Class A Units or Class B Units being owned by a Person
other than a United States Person;

  



  

(v) result in any Member holding less than one (1) Unit of any class on the
last day of any Tax Year in which such Member held any Units; it being
understood that a Member may Transfer up to all but one (1) of such Member's
Units at any time during a Tax Year to the extent otherwise permitted by this
Agreement, provided that such Member's last-held Unit may not be Transferred
until the end of the last day of the last Tax Year in which such Member held
any Units; or

  



  

(vi) result in any breach, violation or contravention of any of the
provisions of Article XII.

  



  

(b) All reasonable expenses incurred by the Company in connection with a
Transfer of Units shall be borne by the transferor (in such amount determined
by the Board, in its sole discretion, acting reasonably).

  



  

(c) If any Transfer (other than a pledge or hypothecation) of a Member's
Interest in the Company shall occur for United States Tax purposes at any
time other than the end of the last day of a Tax Year, the distributive shares
of the various items of Company income, gain, loss, and expense as computed
for tax purposes and the related cash distributions shall be allocated between
the transferor and the transferee in a manner consistent with applicable
requirements under Code §706, utilizing an allocation method based on an
interim closing of the books. The transferee shall agree to reimburse the
Company for any incremental accounting fees and other expenses incurred by
the Company in making such allocation.

  



  

(d) The Preferred Member agrees that it will not Transfer any Class C Units
or Class D Units unless each transferee of such Units takes such Units
subject to the provisions of any subordination agreement then in effect
between the lenders under the Company's senior credit facility and the
Preferred Member, and the transferee of such Units assumes the obligations of
the Preferred Member under any such subordination agreement (or enters into a
substantially similar subordination agreement with such lenders in a form
satisfactory to such lenders).

8.11  _Right to Repurchase Class C Units and Class D Units_. Any one or more
of the Class A Members shall have the right and option at any time to
undertake, or to cause the Company to undertake, upon providing at least sixty
(60) days' advance written notice (a " _Repurchase Notice_ ") to the
Preferred Member, a Repurchase Event which results in the
purchase, repurchase or retraction of all or any lesser number of outstanding
Class C Units and/or Class D Units (but not less than 20% of the aggregate
then-outstanding Class C Units and Class D Units), in exchange for payment of
the amount set forth in the following clauses (a) and (b), provided that no
Repurchase Event would cause or result (whether directly or indirectly and
whether immediately or prospectively) in any breach, violation or
contravention of any of the provisions of Article XII. Upon receipt of a
Repurchase Notice and compliance of any Repurchase Event with the foregoing
proviso, the Preferred Member shall be obligated to sell to the Company the
specified number of Class C Units and/or Class D Units as set out in the
Repurchase Notice, in exchange for payment of the following:

  



  

(a) an amount equal to the Initial Class C Contribution in respect of each
Class C Unit being purchased plus the Initial Class D Contribution in respect
of each Class D Unit being purchased; provided, that:

  



  

(i) in the case of any Repurchase Event consummated on or after the 42-Month
Anniversary (but prior to the one (1)-year anniversary of the 42-Month
Anniversary), such amount shall be 103% of the Initial Class C Contribution in
respect of each Class C Unit being purchased and 103% of the Initial Class D
Contribution in respect of each Class D Unit being purchased; and

  



  

(ii) in the case of any Repurchase Event consummated on or after the one
(1)-year anniversary of the 42-Month Anniversary, such amount payable for any
Class C Unit or Class D Unit shall increase as of such one (1)-year
anniversary and again on each subsequent one (1)-year anniversary to 103% of
the respective amount payable in respect of a Repurchase Event occurring in
the one (1)-year period ending on the immediately preceding one (1)-year
anniversary (for purposes of clarity, in the case of a Repurchase Event in
respect of Class C Units consummated after the second one (1)-year
anniversary of the 42-Month Anniversary but prior to the third one (1)-year
anniversary thereof, such amount payable shall be 109.2727% (i.e., 103%
_multiplied by_ 103% _multiplied by_  103%) of the Initial Class C
Contribution in respect of each Class C Unit being purchased); plus

  



  

(b) all installments of Class C Distribution and Class D Distribution that
are due and payable through the date of consummation of the Repurchase Event.

  



  

8.12  _Change of Control_.

  



   | (a)| Upon  any Change of Control of the Company or upon any Approved
Change of Control of Parent,  and unless waived by Preferred Member Approval,
the Company shall repurchase, contemporaneously  with consummation of any
such Change of Control, all outstanding Class C Units and Class  D Units at
the applicable repurchase price set forth in Section 8.11 determined  as of
the date of completion of such Change of Control assuming (for purposes of
determining  the repurchase price price) that such required repurchase was an
optional repurchase  pursuant to Section 8.11. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | -54-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (b)| All  outstanding Class C Units and Class D Units shall be
automatically exchanged by Parent  for shares of Parent Preferred Stock (and
immediately after the issuance thereof all  such shares of Parent Preferred
Stock shall be automatically converted to Parent common  stock in accordance
with the Parent's certificate of incorporation or any certificate  of
designations of the Parent Preferred Stock then in effect) upon the expiration
of  a successful tender offer in which a majority of the outstanding shares
of Parent common  stock are to be acquired, resulting in an Unapproved Change
of Control of Parent, and  Parent and any acquiring party shall for all
purposes treat the Preferred Member the  same as all other holders of Parent
common stock in such tender offer. To the extent  not prohibited by
applicable Law, the Preferred Member may, in such tender offer,
conditionally  tender the Parent common stock issuable to the Preferred
Member upon conversion of the  Parent Preferred Stock, and Parent and any
acquiring party shall be required to permit  such conditional tender by the
Preferred Member. The number of shares of Parent Preferred  Stock issuable in
exchange for Class C Units and Class D Units in accordance with this  Section
8.12(b) shall be equal to the aggregate repurchase price payable for all of
the  then-outstanding Class C Units and Class D Units, determined as of the
date of commencement  of such tender offer in accordance with Section 8.11
(assuming, for purposes of  determining the repurchase price, that such
tender offer was an optional repurchase pursuant  to Section 8.11), divided
by the average high and low intraday sale prices of the  Parent common stock
for the 30 trading days ending on the 10th trading day  prior to the date of
announcement of the tender offer. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| As  soon as practicable and in any event within ten (10) days
after the occurrence of any  Unapproved Change of Control of Parent (other
than pursuant to a tender offer as described  in Section 8.12(b)), Parent
shall deliver written notice thereof (a " _Change  of Control Notice_ ") to
the Preferred Member setting forth the terms of such  Unapproved Change of
Control of Parent in reasonable detail. At any time after its receipt  of a
Change of Control Notice, the Preferred Member may deliver to Parent written
notice  (" _Exchange Notice_ ") of its election to exchange all of its Class
C  Units and Class D Units for shares of Parent Preferred Stock. Parent shall
promptly,  but in any event within three (3) Business Days after receipt of
such Exchange Notice,  issue to the Preferred Member the number of shares of
Parent Preferred Stock equal to  the aggregate repurchase price payable for
all such Class C Units and Class D Units,  determined as of the date of such
Exchange Notice in accordance with Section 8.11 (assuming,  for purposes of
determining the repurchase price, that such election to exchange was  an
optional repurchase pursuant to Section 8.11), divided by the average high
and  low intraday sale prices of the Parent common stock for the 30 trading
days ending on  the 10th trading day prior to the date of the Exchange
Notice. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

8.13  _Restricted Transactions Affecting any Repurchase Price_. None of the
Members, the Company or any of their Affiliates shall be permitted to enter
into any reorganization or other transaction or series of transactions
(whether for tax planning or other purposes) which would constitute a
Repurchase Event and whose primary effect or result would be reducing or
avoiding payment of the applicable price payable hereunder.

  



  

   

 | -55-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.14  _Prohibited Modifications to Repurchase Price_. Neither any Member nor
the Company or any other member of the Sequel Group may enter into any
reorganization or other transaction or series of transactions (whether for tax
planning or other purposes) which could individually or collectively create a
Repurchase Event in respect of the Class C Units and/or Class D Units
whose primary effect or result would be reducing the applicable price payable
hereunder.

  



  

8.15 _Tag Along Rights_.

  



  

(a) _Tag Along Rights_. At least thirty-five (35) days prior to the sale by
one or more of the Class A Members (individually or collectively, the "
_Selling Member_ ") of Units constituting greater than fifty percent (50%) of
the fully diluted Class A Units then outstanding to any Person or group of
Persons in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, excluding transfers (i) permitted pursuant to Section 8.9, (ii)
to another Class A Member, or (iii) to such Member's spouse, children or
grandchildren or a trust created for the primary benefit of such Member or his
or her spouse, children or grandchildren (a " _Third-Party Purchaser_ ")
(each, a " _Tag Sale_ ") (collectively, the " _Buyer_ "), such Selling Member
shall provide to the Company, which shall provide to each Class A and Class B
Member (each, a " _Tag Seller_ ") a notice (a " _Tag Along Notice_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail the terms of such sale (including, without
limitation, the price offered per Class A Unit), the number of Class A and
Class B Units such Buyer wishes to purchase (the " _Tag Along Units_ ") and
identifying the name of the Buyer. Upon the written request of any Tag Seller
received by the Selling Member prior to the 30th day after the day the Tag
Along Notice was sent by such Tag Seller, the Selling Member proposing to
make the sale shall cause the Buyer to purchase from such Tag Seller the
number of Class A and Class B Units held by such Tag Seller equal to the
lesser of (x) the number of Units requested to be included in the Tag Sale by
such Tag Seller and (y) a number determined by multiplying (A) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the total number of Class A and Class B Units then held
by such Tag Seller, and the denominator of which is the total number of Class
A and Class B Units then held by all of the Tag Sellers and the Selling Member
by (B) the number of Tag Along Units to be sold in such Tag Sale.

  



  

(b) _Equality of Class A and Class B Units_. Each Class A and Class B Unit
shall be entitled to receive the same per Unit consideration as part of any
Tag Sale.

  



  

(c) _Buyer 's Refusal to Purchase_. To the extent that any Buyer refuses to
purchase such Units from such Tag Seller, the Selling Member shall not make
any transfer of any Tag Along Units to such Buyer unless and until,
simultaneously with such Transfer, the Selling Member purchases from such Tag
Seller the number of such Tag Seller's Units as are required to be purchased
by such Buyer pursuant to the terms hereof at a price and upon other terms
and conditions which are no less favorable to such Tag Seller than as set
forth in the Tag Along Notice. Such purchase from such Tag Seller by the
Selling Member shall be made on the same date as any sale of Class A Units by
the Selling Member to the Buyer in such Tag Sale, at a price equal to a
proportionate share of the aggregate purchase price paid in such Tag Sale
(which proportionate share shall be based upon the per Unit price paid by
the Buyer and the number of Units sold by such Tag Seller in such Tag Sale)
and on terms and conditions substantially similar to the terms and conditions
contained in the Tag Along Notice delivered in connection with such proposed
transaction.

  



  

   

 | -56-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Conditions of Exercise_. In order to exercise its rights under this
Section 8.15, each Tag Seller will, if requested by the Selling Member and
reasonably necessary to consummate such transaction, (i) offer certain
representations and warranties in connection with such Tag Sale (but in no
event shall such representations and warranties extend to any matters other
than the Tag Seller's organization, good standing and authority, title to the
Units that are the subject of the Tag Sale and the absence of conflicts with
the Tag Seller's organizational documents) and (ii) deliver to the Buyer (or
to the Selling Member for delivery to the Buyer) one or more instruments or
certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, free and clear of any liens,
representing its Units which are to be transferred in the Tag Sale. Each Tag
Seller and the Selling Member shall pay its pro rata share (based upon the
proportionate amount of the gross proceeds each Tag Seller and the Selling
Member is entitled to receive in such Tag Sale in relation to the gross
proceeds of the Tag Sale as a whole) of any reasonable transaction costs
associated with the sale other than the independent legal expenses and
selling commissions of the other participants in the Tag Sale, which shall be
borne independently by each such participant.

  



  

(e) _Further Limitations_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transaction
described in the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.15 shall be permitted
to the extent it causes or results in any breach, violation or contravention
of any other provision of the Agreement, including Article VI, the other
provisions of this Article VIII, Article IX or Article XII.

  



  

8.16  _Drag Along Rights_.

  



  

(a) _Drag Along Rights_. If at any time prior to the completion by the
Company of an underwritten public offering and sale of its Interests pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, Class A
Members (individually or collectively, the " _Triggering Party_ ") desire to
sell Units constituting greater than fifty percent (50%) of the fully diluted
Class A Units then outstanding to a Third-Party Purchaser (or group thereof)
pursuant to a bona fide offer to purchase such Class A Units, and such
proposed sale has been approved by the Board (acting in its good faith
judgment and in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties) (a " _Drag
Sale_ "), then the Triggering Party shall have the right to require each other
Member holding Class A or Class B Units of the Company (the " _Drag Subject
Members_ ") to sell the same proportionate share of its Class A and Class B
Units (including Units represented by options that have not yet been
exercised) to such Third-Party Purchaser(s) as the Triggering Party desires
to sell. Each Class A and Class B Unit shall be entitled to receive the same
per Unit consideration as part of any Drag Sale.

  



  

(b) _Exercise of Drag Along Rights_. To exercise its rights under this
Section 8.16, the Triggering Party shall send each Drag Subject Member a
written notice of sale (a " _Drag Sale Notice_ ") at least twenty (20) days
prior to the consummation of any Drag Sale, which Drag Sale Notice shall
notify such Drag Subject Member of the general terms of such Drag Sale and
that the Triggering Party is exercising its rights with respect to the same
under this Section 8.16. Within five (5) days of its receipt of a Drag Sale
Notice with respect to a Drag Sale, each Drag Subject Member shall deliver to
the Triggering Party one or more certificates or assignment instruments with
respect to the Units (or rights under option agreements) to be sold
pursuant to this Section 8.16, duly endorsed in blank, free and clear of all
liens. If a Drag Subject Member fails to so deliver any such certificate or
assignment instrument, from and after the date on which the Drag Sale is
consummated, the Units or options in the Company that such Drag Subject
Member is obligated to sell under this Section 8.16 shall be deemed to be no
longer outstanding, and such Drag Subject Member shall cease to be a Member
of the Company (unless it holds other Equity Interests therein not subject to
the obligations of this Section 8.16) and shall have no rights with respect
thereto except the right to receive payment of the consideration paid in
respect of such Units in the Company pursuant to the terms of the Drag Sale,
without interest, upon delivery to the purchaser in such Drag Sale of any
such certificate and assignment instrument.

  



  

   

 | -57-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Duties of Drag Subject Members_. In addition to the requirements set
forth in Section 8.16(b), if the Drag Sale is structured as (i) a merger or
consolidation, each Drag Subject Member shall vote its Units to approve such
Drag Sale, whether by written consent or at a meeting (as requested by the
Triggering Party), and waive all dissenter's rights, appraisal rights and
similar rights in connection with such transaction or (ii) a sale of Units,
each Drag Subject Member shall agree to sell, and shall sell, all of its
Units subject to the Drag Sale on the terms and conditions approved by the
Triggering Party, in each case, irrespective of the consideration such Drag
Subject Member is expected to derive from such Drag Sale, provided that each
Drag Subject Member shall be informed of the consideration such Drag Subject
Member is expected to derive from such Drag Sale. In furtherance of
the foregoing and in addition to the requirements set forth in Section
8.16(b), each Drag Subject Member shall take, with respect to such Drag
Subject Member's Units or the Drag Sale, all reasonably necessary actions
directed by the Triggering Party in connection with the consummation of the
Drag Sale by the Company, including executing the applicable purchase, merger
or other similar agreement. In any Drag Sale, if requested by the Triggering
Party, each Drag Subject Member shall be obligated to make representations
and warranties as to such Drag Subject Member's title to and ownership of
Units, authorization, execution and delivery of relevant documents by such
Drag Subject Member, enforceability of relevant agreements against such Drag
Subject Member and other matters relating to such Drag Subject Member, to
enter into covenants or other agreements in respect of a Transfer of such
Drag Subject Member's Units (or options) in connection with such Drag Sale
(which may include holdbacks, escrow arrangements and earn-outs, among other
matters) and to enter into indemnification agreements with respect to the
foregoing; provided, however, that no Drag Subject Member shall be obligated
to enter into indemnification obligations with respect to any
representations, warranties or covenants in the nature of those described
above to the extent relating to or in respect of any other Member or any
other Member's Units. Net proceeds from a Drag Sale that are not paid directly
to the Drag Subject Members shall be distributed as provided in Section 6.9.

  



  

(d) _Conditions of Drag Sale_. The obligations of each Drag Subject Member
under this Section 8.16 with respect to an Drag Sale are subject to the
condition that each Drag Subject Member shall receive the same form of
consideration and the same portion of the aggregate consideration that
holders of Units would have received if such aggregate consideration had been
distributed by the Company pursuant to Section 6.9.

  



  

(e) _Rule 506 Transactions_. If the Company or the Triggering Party enters
into any negotiation or transaction for which Rule 506 of the Securities Act
(or any similar rule then in effect) may be available with respect to such
negotiation or transaction (including a merger, consolidation or other
reorganization), each Drag Subject Member shall, at the request of the Company
or the Triggering Party, appoint a purchaser representative (as such term is
defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act) reasonably acceptable to the
Triggering Party at such Drag Subject Member's sole cost and expense.

  



  

   

 | -58-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Allocation of Costs_. Each Drag Subject Member shall bear its pro rata
share (based on the gross proceeds payable to each such Drag Subject Member
in the Drag Sale relative to the aggregate gross proceeds of the Drag Sale) of
the costs of any Drag Sale to the extent such costs are incurred for the
benefit of all holders of Equity Interests subject to this Section 8.16 and
are not otherwise paid by the Company or the acquiring party. For purposes of
this Section 8.16(f), costs incurred in exercising reasonable efforts to take
all necessary actions in connection with the consummation of an Drag Sale in
accordance with Section 8.16(a) shall be deemed to be for the benefit of all
Members holding Class A or Class B Units subject to this Section 8.16,
except that costs incurred by any Member in connection with the transfer of
its own Units (or options therefore) or otherwise on its own behalf will not
be considered costs of the transaction hereunder and shall be the
responsibility of such Member.

  



  

(g) _Appointment of Agent, Further Assurances_. In furtherance of the
provisions of this Section 8.16, for so long as this Section 8.16 is in
effect, each Drag Subject Member (and its successors, heirs, legal
representatives, and permitted assigns and transferees) hereby (i)
irrevocably appoints the Company and its designees as such Drag Subject
Member's agents and attorneys-in-fact (the " _Drag Along Agents_ ") (with
full power of substitution) to execute all agreements, instruments and
certificates and take all actions necessary or desirable to effectuate any
Drag Sale as contemplated herein, and (ii) grants to each Drag Along Agent a
proxy (which shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and to be
irrevocable) to vote the Units having voting power held by such Person and
exercise any consent rights applicable thereto in favor of any such Drag Sale
as provided in this Section 8.16. THE AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION
8.16 ARE COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND ARE GIVEN TO SECURE THE PERFORMANCE OF
THE DRAG SUBJECT MEMBERS' OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT AS
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH PROXIES MAY NOT BE REVOKED OR TERMINATED
DURING THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT AND SHALL SURVIVE THE DEATH, INCOMPETENCY,
DISABILITY, BANKRUPTCY OR DISSOLUTION OF EACH DRAG SUBJECT MEMBER AND THE
SUBSEQUENT HOLDERS OF ITS UNITS OR OTHER EQUITY INTERESTS IN RESPECT OF UNITS.
No Drag Subject Member shall grant any proxy or become party to any voting
trust or other agreement which is inconsistent with, conflicts with or
violates any provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(h) _Further Limitations._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transaction
described in the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.16 shall be permitted
to the extent it causes or results in any breach, violation or contravention
of any other provision of the Agreement, including Article VI, the other
provisions of this Article VIII, or Article IX.

Member Approval, any of the following shall be considered an " _Event of
Default_ " under this Agreement:

  



  

(a) the occurrence of a Liquidation Event with respect to the Company or any
member of the Sequel Group that generates at least 25% of the Same Program
Revenues;

  



  

(b) the Board, the Company or any other member of the Sequel Group undertakes
any action or makes any proposal to implement, enter into or permit to occur
or exist any Nondefault Preferred Consent Matter or any Delinquent Payment
Preferred Consent Matter without first obtaining the Preferred Member
Approval required pursuant to this Agreement; and

  



  

(c) the Company fails to repurchase any Class C Units and Class D Units
within ninety (90) days of the date that repurchase is required under the
provisions of Section 8.12.

  



  

9.2  _Rights and Obligations upon an Event of Default_. Upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default, and in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies of the holders of Class C Units and/or Class D Units under this
Agreement and applicable Law, the Company shall repurchase, within ninety
(90) days following the date of occurrence of such Event of Default, all
outstanding Class C Units and Class D Units from the holder(s) thereof at the
applicable price set forth in Section 8.11 assuming (for purposes of
determining the repurchase price) that such required repurchase was an
optional repurchase pursuant to Section 8.11, and upon and following the
occurrence of such Event of Default until such repurchase is consummated, none
of the Board, the Company or any other member of the Sequel Group shall,
without first obtaining Preferred Member Approval, propose, implement, enter
into or permit to occur or exist any Default Preferred Consent Matter.

  



  

Article X

10.1  _Events Requiring Winding Up_. The Company shall be dissolved and its
affairs shall be wound up only on the first to occur of the following events:

  



  

(a) subject to prior Preferred Member Approval, a determination by the Board
as provided herein;

  



  

(b) the consent of all Members;

manner permitted by this Agreement or the Act;

  



  

provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing and to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any dissolution and winding up of the Company shall be
effective only as of the end of a Tax Year.

  



  

   

 | -60-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.2 _Winding Up_.

  



  

(a) In the event of dissolution, the Company shall continue solely for the
purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner, liquidating its
assets and satisfying the claims of its creditors and Members, in each case,
in accordance with the Act. No Member shall take any action that is
inconsistent with or not necessary to or appropriate for the winding up of the
Company's business and affairs. Subject to the Act, the Board shall be
responsible for overseeing the winding up of the Company, and shall take
full account of the Company's liabilities and assets, and the Company shall
be liquidated and terminated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the
fair value thereof, and the proceeds therefrom, to the extent sufficient
therefor, shall be applied and distributed in the following order of
priority, unless otherwise required by nonwaivable provisions of applicable
Law:

  



  

(i) first, to the payment of creditors of the Company (including Members,
except for the purposes of this Section 10.2(a)(i), to the extent any Member
is owed monies as a Class C Distribution or Class D Distribution pursuant to
Section 6.8 or as a Capital Contribution such Members shall not be deemed to
be a creditor of the Company), in the order of priority provided by Law, in
satisfaction of all debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company due its
creditors; and

  



  

(ii) second, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
balance, if any, to all Members, in accordance with their respective Capital
Account balances (after adjustment to reflect the allocations pursuant to
Article VI), not later than the time specified for such distribution pursuant
to Regs. §704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2).

  



  

(b) Except as required by non-waivable provisions of the Act, if any Member
has a deficit balance in his, her or its Capital Account (after giving effect
to all contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years,
including the year during which such liquidation occurs), such Member shall
have no obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Company with
respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be considered a debt owed
to the Company or to any other Person, for any purpose whatsoever. No Member
shall receive any additional compensation for any services performed pursuant
to this Article X.

  



  

10.3  _Limitations on Payments_. Subject to the Act, each Member shall only
be entitled to look solely to the assets of the Company for the return of
his, her or its positive Capital Account balance and shall have no recourse
for his, her or its Capital Contribution and/or share of income or gain of
the Company (upon winding up or otherwise) against the Managers or any other
Member.

  



  

10.4  _Distributions In-Kind_. If any assets of the Company are distributed
in-kind pursuant to this Agreement, such assets shall be distributed to the
Members entitled thereto as tenants-in-common in the same proportions as the
Members would have been entitled to cash distributions if such Property had
been sold for cash at its fair market value (as determined by an independent
appraiser) and the net proceeds thereof distributed to the Members. In the
event that distributions in-kind are made to the Members, the Capital Account
balances of such Members shall be adjusted to reflect the Members' allocable
share of gain or loss which would have resulted if the distributed Property
had been sold at such fair market value.

  



  

   

 | -61-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.5  _Termination_. The Company shall terminate when (i) all of the assets
of the Company, after payment of or due provision for all debts, liabilities
and obligations of the Company, shall have been distributed to the Members in
the manner provided in this Agreement and (ii) the Certificate of Formation
shall have been cancelled in the manner required by the Act.

  



  

10.6  _Liquidating Trust and Reserves_. In the reasonable discretion of the
Board, but subject to the nonwaivable provisions of the Act, a pro rata
portion of the distributions that would otherwise be made to the Members
pursuant to this Article X may be:

  



  

(a) distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the Members, for
the purpose of liquidating Company assets, collecting amounts owed to the
Company, and paying any contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of
the Company arising out of or in connection with the Company; the assets of
any such trust shall be distributed to the Members from time to time, in the
reasonable discretion of the Board, in the same proportions as the amount
distributed to such trust by the Company would otherwise have been
distributed to the Members, pursuant to this Agreement; or

  



  

(b) withheld to provide a reasonable reserve for Company liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion of
any installment obligations owed to the Company; provided that such withheld
amount shall be distributed to the Members as soon as practicable.

  



  

Article XI

  

 _Exculpation and Indemnification_

  



  

11.1  _Exculpation_. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Section
4.8 (and not this Section 11.1) shall govern the liability and exculpation of
Managers. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
the Members, nor any officers, directors, stockholders, partners, employees,
representatives or agents of any Member, nor any officer,
employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(individually, a " _Covered Person_ " and, collectively, the " _Covered
Persons_ ") shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be liable to the
Company, the Members, the Managers, the officers of the Company or any other
Person for any act or omission (relating to the Company and the conduct of
its business, this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby) taken or omitted in good faith by a Covered
Person; provided, that such act or omission does not constitute bad faith,
fraud or willful misconduct; and provided further, that this Section 11.1
shall not eliminate any liability of a Covered Person with respect to any
contract between such Covered Person and the Company or any member of the
Sequel Group.

  



  

11.2 _Indemnification and Advancements_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless each Covered Person from and against any and all losses,
claims, demands, liabilities, expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and
other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (" _Claims_ "),
in which the Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as
a party or otherwise, by reason of its management of the affairs of the
Company or which relates to or arises out of the Company or its Property,
business or affairs; provided, that such Claim does not result from bad
faith, fraud or willful misconduct of the Covered Person. A Covered Person
shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section (a) with respect
to (i) any Claim with respect to which a court or Governmental Entity has
made a final and nonappealable determination that such Covered Person has
engaged in bad faith, committed fraud or willful misconduct or (ii) any Claim
initiated by such Covered Person unless such Claim (or part thereof) (A) was
brought to enforce such Covered Person's rights to indemnification or
advancements hereunder or (B) was authorized or consented to by the
Board. Expenses incurred by a Covered Person in defending any Claim shall be
paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such Claim upon
receipt by the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered
Person to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined that such
Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized
by this Section (a).

  



  

   

 | -62-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company shall defend and hold
harmless each Manager from and against any and all losses, claims, demands,
liabilities, expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising
from any and all Claims in which the Manager may be involved, or threatened
to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of being a Manager;
provided, that such Claim does not result from a breach of such Manager's
duties as set forth in Section 4.5. A Manager shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Section (b) with respect to any Claim with respect
to which a court or Governmental Entity has made a final and nonappealable
determination that such Manager breached such Manager's duties as set forth
in Section 4.5. Expenses incurred by a Manager in defending any Claim shall
be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such Claim upon
receipt by the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Manager to
repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined that such Manager is
not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized by this Section
(b).

  



  

11.3  _Fraud_. For all purposes of this Article XI, with respect to
activities governed by or construed under Medicare, Medicaid or other U.S.
federal or state healthcare laws or programs, an act or omission by a Covered
Person shall not be deemed fraud unless the Covered Person knows or
reasonably should know that the act or omission constitutes fraud under such
healthcare laws or programs.

  



  

11.4  _Amendments_. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Article XI
shall be prospective only and shall not in any way adversely affect any
rights of any Covered Person or Manager pursuant to this Article XI as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal.

Article XII

  

 _Tax Matters Specific to Alaris and its Affiliates_

  



  

12.1 _Tax Integrity_.

  



  

(a) The Class A Members and Class B Members acknowledge that so long as
Alaris or an Affiliate transferee of Alaris is the Preferred Member then it
is of material importance to the integrity of the structure through which
Alaris has made the Initial Class C Contribution and the Initial Class D
Contribution, will hold any Class C Units or Class D Units and will receive
any Class C Distribution or Class D Distribution, that the following be true
at all times:

  



  

(i) the voting power of the Class C Units collectively held by Alaris and its
Affiliates at any time may not, for any reason, represent less than 10.0% of
the combined voting power of all Units of all classes and series then
outstanding;

  



  

(ii) the value of the Class C Units and Class D Units collectively held by
Alaris and its Affiliates at any time may not, for any reason, comprise less
than 10.0% of the value of all Units of all classes and series then
outstanding; and

  



  

(iii) not less than 90.0% of all of the assets of the Sequel Group, including
cash and cash equivalent assets, will at all times be applied in the active
conduct of the Sequel Business by the Sequel Group.

  



  

(b) The Class A Members, the Class B Members and the Company agree to
cooperate in good faith with Alaris in taking such actions (or refraining
from taking such actions) as may reasonably be requested by Alaris which are
necessary to preserve the integrity of Alaris's tax position; provided, that
each Member and the Company shall not be required to take, or refrain from
taking, any such action if (i) it would result in any direct costs or other
adverse economic consequences to such Person unless Alaris agrees to
reimburse such Person for such direct costs or other adverse economic
consequences or (ii) such action is in response to an action taken by Alaris
that threatens the integrity of Alaris's tax position (such as a voluntary
Transfer of Class C Units or Class D Units resulting in the remaining Class C
Units or Class D Units held by Alaris comprising, in the aggregate, less than
10.0% of the value of all Units of all classes and series then outstanding).

  



  

(c) If, at any time that the Preferred Member holds Class D Units, any event
occurs that would cause the voting power of the Class C Units then held by
the Preferred Member to hold less than 10.0% of the combined voting power of
all voting Units in the Company or such other minimum or maximum percentage
as may be required by the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada), as amended from time to
time, to maintain the tax integrity of the Preferred Member's investment in
Class C Units and Class D Units as contemplated by this Article XII (such
percentage, the " _Voting Threshold_ "), then upon the effectiveness of each
such event (i) a number of Class D Units then held by the Preferred Member
shall be automatically converted to Class C Units on a Unit-for-Unit basis to
the minimum extent necessary to provide that, upon such conversion, the voting
power of the aggregate Class C Units then held by the Preferred Member shall
equal or exceed the Voting Threshold, and (ii) the Board shall amend the books
and records of the Company to reflect such conversion without further act,
vote or consent of any other Person, which amendment shall constitute an
amendment to this Agreement permitted by Section 13.1 hereof.

  



  

   

 | -64-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

12.2  _Provision of Information and Distribution of Redundant Assets_. The
Sequel Group will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Preferred
Member in maintaining certain important Canadian tax characteristics of the
Preferred Member's ownership of Class C Units and Class D Units. In
particular and without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Class
A Members will cause the Company and the Sequel Group to:

  



  

(a) obtain Preferred Member Approval prior to any conduct of the Sequel
Business outside the United States, except to the extent all income earned
from non-U.S. business activities of the Sequel Group constitutes less than
10.0% of all income of the Sequel Group;

  



  

(b) immediately notify the Preferred Member in the event it becomes
reasonably likely that the total income in any future period from
non-U.S. business of the Sequel Group may constitute 10.0% or more of all
income of the Sequel Group;

  



  

(c) refrain from retaining distributable assets which are not being applied
in the active conduct of the Sequel Business or making loans of such
distributable assets in lieu of distributions; and

  



  

(d) provide Alaris with such relevant information concerning the Sequel
Group's assets and undertakings as may be requested by Alaris from time to
time with reasonable advance notice.

  



  

Article XIII

  

 _Miscellaneous_

  



  

13.1  _Amendments to this Agreement_. Except as otherwise provided in
Sections 3.4(b), 5.3(c), 8.5(c) or 12.1(c), this Agreement may be amended
only if embodied in an instrument signed by each member of the Board and the
Preferred Member; provided, that unless otherwise specifically contemplated
by this Agreement, no amendment to this Agreement shall, without the prior
consent of each Member adversely affected thereby, disproportionately
decrease any Member's interest in Profit or items of income or gain and
distributions or disproportionately increase any Member's interest in Loss or
items of deduction or loss. In the event this Agreement shall be amended
pursuant to this Section 13.1, the Board, acting unanimously, shall be
empowered to and shall amend the Certificate of Formation to reflect such
change if the Board, in its unanimous good faith judgment, deems such
amendment of the Articles to be necessary, appropriate or desirable.

  



  

13.2  _Successors; Counterparts_. Subject to Article VIII, this Agreement (a)
shall be binding as to the executors, administrators, estates, heirs and
legal successors, or nominees or representatives, of the Members and (b) may

if the parties executing the several counterparts had all executed one
counterpart.

  



  

13.3  _Spousal Consent_. Any Member who resides in a community property state
and who is married, and any Member who resides in a community property state
and who, subsequent to the date hereof, marries or remarries, shall
concurrently with the later of his or her execution hereof or marriage
deliver to the Board the written consent of his or her spouse in form and
substance acceptable to the Board; provided, that the failure of any such
Member to do so shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement.

  



  

   

 | -65-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

13.4  _Expenses_. Except as provided otherwise in any subscription agreement
to which a Member is a party, each Member shall bear its own expenses
incurred by it in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related Agreements.

  



  

13.5  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law.

  



  

13.6  _Arbitration_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS, CONTROVERSIES AND DISPUTES ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE ADJUDICATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
FOLLOWING:

  



  

(a) UPON DEMAND OF ANY PARTY HERETO ANY CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN OR AMONG

AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED AGREEMENT SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION
CONDUCTED UNDER AND GOVERNED BY THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL DISPUTES ARBITRATION
RULES (THE " _ARBITRATION RULES_ ") OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION
(THE " _AAA_ ") AND THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. DISPUTES MAY INCLUDE, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, TORT CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, A DISPUTE AS TO WHETHER A MATTER IS
SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, CLAIMS BROUGHT AS CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLAIMS
ARISING FROM DOCUMENTS EXECUTED IN THE FUTURE. A JUDGMENT UPON THE RESULTANT
ARBITRATION AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION.

  



  

(b) ALL ARBITRATION HEARINGS SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. A
HEARING SHALL BEGIN WITHIN 45 DAYS OF DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION AND ALL HEARINGS
SHALL CONCLUDE WITHIN 75 DAYS OF DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION. THESE TIME
LIMITATIONS MAY NOT BE EXTENDED UNLESS A PARTY SHOWS CAUSE FOR EXTENSION AND
THEN FOR NO MORE THAN A TOTAL OF 60 DAYS. THE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES SET FORTH
IN RULE 51 ET. SEQ. OF THE ARBITRATION RULES SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO CLAIMS OF

 | -66-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRECEDING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, THE PARTIES
HERETO AGREE TO PRESERVE, WITHOUT DIMINUTION, CERTAIN REMEDIES THAT ANY PARTY
HERETO MAY EXERCISE BEFORE OR AFTER AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT. THE

13.7  _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY
AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 13.6 THEY ARE IRREVOCABLY

AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE AMENDMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF, OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
RELATED AGREEMENT, OR (b) ANY CONDUCT, ACT OR OMISSION OF THE PARTIES OR
THEIR AFFILIATES (OR ANY OF THEM) WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY RELATED AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE AMENDMENT HEREOF OR
THEREOF, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS OF WHICH
PARTY INITIATES AN ADJUDICATION OF SUCH DISPUTE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES
AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH ADJUDICATION OF SUCH DISPUTE SHALL BE DECIDED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 13.6.

  



  

13.8  _Severability_. If any provision or clause of this Agreement is held to
be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision or clause shall be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; provided,
however, that the remaining provisions and clauses will continue in full
force without being impaired or invalidated in any way unless such invalid or
unenforceable provision or clause shall be so significant as to materially
affect the expectations of the Member(s) regarding this Agreement. Otherwise,
any invalid or unenforceable provision or clause shall be replaced by the
Member(s) with a valid provision or clause which most closely approximates
the intent and economic effect of the invalid or unenforceable provision.

13.10  _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. Other than the Covered Persons (with
respect to Article XI) and the Managers (with respect to Sections 4.5, 4.6,

Member hereunder, including any rights pursuant to Article VIII hereof, may
be assigned, except in connection with the transfer by a Member of its
Interest to a Permitted Transferee or another Transfer permitted under
Article VIII. Any such attempted assignment in contravention of
this Agreement shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be void and of
no effect.

ACQUIOMTM PAYMENTS ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS ACQUIOMTM PAYMENTS ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is
entered into as of [●], 2017, by and among: Global Partner Acquisition Corp.,
a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "); John F. Ripley, (the " _Securityholder
Representative_ "), solely in his capacity as the representative of the Legacy
Equityholders of Sequel Youth and Family Services, LLC, an Iowa limited
liability company (the " _Company_ ") (referred to herein as the "
_Securityholders_ "); and Acquiom Clearinghouse LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Acquiom_ "). Reference is made to that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), by and among Parent, Global Partner Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a securityholder of Parent, Sequel Acquisition,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Sequel Acquisition_ "), the Company, and the Securityholder
Representative, pursuant to which, among other things, Sequel Acquisition will
be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger
(the " _Survivor_ "). The Securityholder Representative and Parent are
referred to herein collectively as the " _Parties_ ". The terms and conditions
set forth on the attached schedules are incorporated herein by reference and
shall be deemed part of this Agreement.

  



  

1\. Appointment. The Parties hereby engage Acquiom as the payments
administrator concerning the Paying Account (as defined below) for
the purposes set forth herein, and Acquiom hereby accepts such appointment
and agrees to perform the services set forth herein. Acquiom will provide
accounting, payments processing, securityholder support and other
administrative services as set forth in _Schedule I_ , in connection with the
activities contemplated herein, including disbursement from time to time to
the Securityholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and,
solely as between the Parties, the Merger Agreement and that certain Escrow
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among SunTrust Bank ("
_SunTrust_ "), Parent and the Securityholder Representative, solely in his
capacity as representative of the Securityholders (the " _Escrow Agreement_
") of (a) cash, (b) certificates representing the Class B Common Units of
the Survivor delivered to Acquiom by Parent and each printed and issued in
the name of each Securityholder entitled to such Class B Units of Survivor ("
_Survivor Units_ ") and (c) warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock of
Parent delivered to Acquiom by Parent's transfer agent and issued in the name
of each Securityholder entitled to such warrants (the " _Warrants_ ").

  



  

2\. Establishment of Accounts. Parent will advise Acquiom of the closing date
of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the " _Closing
Date_ "). At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Parties will provide Acquiom with completed account opening forms required
for the opening of accounts, and will provide a final copy of the Merger
Agreement no later than the Closing Date. The Parties agree and understand
that any delay in the delivery of such forms could delay the opening of the
accounts in compliance with applicable regulations, which could in turn delay
the Parties' ability to consummate the transactions contemplated in the
Merger Agreement. The Parties hereby instruct Acquiom to utilize and
administer a paying account (the " _Paying Account_ ") at SunTrust for the
purposes set forth herein. Acquiom shall have the authority to direct
SunTrust to make payments from the Paying Account, solely in accordance with
this Agreement. The Parties agree that SunTrust shall have no liability to the
Parties for any payments remitted from the Paying Account as directed by
Acquiom. Prior to the Closing Date (subject to the completion of the
account opening processes), Acquiom will provide the Parties with wire
transfer and delivery instructions necessary to fund the Paying Account and
for Parent to deliver or cause to be delivered the Survivor Units and Warrants
as contemplated under this Agreement. The funds in the Paying Account shall
be held in one or more non-interest bearing accounts of SunTrust. Acquiom may
take any actions it reasonably determines necessary to comply with applicable
laws, rules and regulations including, without limitation, in connection with
verification of identities under Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001, provided that Acquiom shall provide notice to the
Parties promptly after taking any such action that is not contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

   

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3\. Deposits of Consideration. On the Closing Date, Parent will deposit into
the Paying Account, using the wire instructions attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ immediately available funds in an amount to be notified to Acquiom one (1)
Business Day prior to such deposit as determined pursuant to the Merger
Agreement (the " _Cash Closing Consideration Deposit_ "). Thereafter, Parent
and/or the Securityholder Representative may from time to time deposit or
cause to be deposited additional funds into the Paying Account. On the
Closing Date, the Parent shall or shall cause Parent's transfer agent,
as applicable, to deliver to Acquiom Survivor Units and Warrants in such
amounts to be notified to Acquiom one (1) Business Day prior to such deposit,
in each case as determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the " _Equity
Closing Consideration Deposit_ ", and together with the Cash Closing
Consideration Deposit, the " _Closing Consideration Deposit_ ").

  



  

4\. Compensation.

  



   | a.| Disclosure.  The Parties agree and understand that Acquiom may
receive fees in connection with the  services provided under this Agreement.
Any such compensation is reflected as a reduction  or waiver of fees that
Acquiom or its affiliates, as applicable, otherwise would have  charged in
connection with their respective services. In the case of Acquiom, the fees 
that may be received are paid by SunTrust as transaction fees calculated as a
percentage  of the average monthly balances deposited with SunTrust held as a
bank deposit at SunTrust. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b.| Fees.  Except as expressly described in this Agreement, including
_Exhibit E_ attached  hereto, Acquiom shall not charge fees to the Parties
for the services provided by it  hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the
terms of this paragraph shall not in any  way limit the rights of Acquiom to
indemnification as set forth in this Agreement. Requests  for services and/or
service levels beyond those specifically contracted for in this Agreement 
may be subject to additional charges. Any applicable charges are payable
directly to  Acquiom by Parent. Except for additional charges related to
payee-requested service level  upgrades for payments, which shall be charged
to the requesting Securityholder by deduction  from the amount of such
payment, all other additional service charges due to Acquiom  shall be paid,
severally and not jointly, one-half by Parent and one-half by the
Securityholders.  Acquiom shall, if applicable, invoice Parent and the
Securityholder Representative (on  behalf of the Securityholders) for any
such fees from time to time due under this Agreement.  If applicable, Parent
shall pay Acquiom for any additional services to be rendered hereunder,  as
described in _Exhibit E_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

5. General Provisions.

  



   | a.| No  Joint Venture. Notwithstanding any provision herein, the
Parties do not hereby create,  and do not intend to hereby create, any joint
venture, partnership or other similar cooperative  venture.

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



   | c.| Acquiom  Responsibilities. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | i.| Acquiom  shall have only those duties as are specifically and
expressly provided herein, which  shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no other duties shall be implied. Acquiom  shall not be
responsible for, or chargeable with knowledge of, or have any requirements 
to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or
document  between the Parties in connection herewith, if any, including
without limitation the  Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, nor shall
Acquiom be required to determine  if any person or entity has complied with
the Merger Agreement or Escrow Agreement, nor  shall any additional
obligations of Acquiom be inferred from the terms of the Merger  Agreement or
Escrow Agreement, even though reference thereto may be made in this
Agreement.  Acquiom shall keep the terms of the Merger Agreement and Escrow
Agreement confidential,  except for disclosure expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, or as required by law,  or to the extent such terms are or become
publicly known through no fault of Acquiom.  In the event of any conflict
between the terms and provisions of this Agreement, those  of the Merger
Agreement, Escrow Agreement, any exhibit  or schedule attached to this
Agreement, or any other agreement among the Parties,  as between Acquiom and
the Parties, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall  control, and
as between the Parties, the Merger Agreement shall control. Acquiom may  rely
upon, and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon, any
written  notice, document, instruction or request (including instructions or
documents provided  by a Securityholder or a person acting on behalf of such
Securityholder) furnished hereunder  and reasonably believed by it in good
faith to be genuine without inquiry and without  requiring substantiating
evidence of any kind. Without limiting the intent of the foregoing,  Acquiom
may in its sole discretion (A) employ, or decline to employ any process or
procedure  to carry out its responsibilities set forth herein, including,
without limitation, in  connection with the confirmation of identities,
account information or payment instructions  and (B) determine the
sufficiency of any documents or instructions delivered to it hereunder. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood
and agreed  that nothing contained herein shall obligate Acquiom to provide
any services that would  require it to register as a transfer agent under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  be licensed as a money transmitter under
any State money transmitter laws, register as  a money services business
under the federal Bank Secrecy Act, or obtain a banking license,  and, to the
extent necessary to give effect to each of the foregoing, the description  of
the services herein shall be deemed to be modified in appropriate instances in
order  to contemplate the additional or lesser services and procedures
necessary to avoid such  registration or licensure requirements. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | ii.| Acquiom  shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it except  to the extent that a final adjudication of
a court of competent jurisdiction determines  that its fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any loss  to any
party hereto. Acquiom may execute any of its powers and perform any of its
duties  hereunder directly or through its affiliates or agents. Acquiom may
consult with counsel  and experts to be selected and retained by it and shall
not be liable for any action  taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in
accordance with, or in reliance upon,  advice or an opinion of any such
counsel or experts. Anything in this Agreement to the  contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall Acquiom be liable for special,
incidental,  punitive, indirect, exemplary or consequential loss or damage of
any kind whatsoever  (including but not limited to lost profits), even if it
has been advised of the likelihood  of such loss or damage and regardless of
the form of action. Acquiom shall not have any  obligation to make or
facilitate, as applicable, any payment unless the applicable party  shall
have provided the necessary readily available funds to make such payments and
shall  not be liable or responsible for any delay or failure of a party or
any other person  or entity to comply with any of their respective
obligations relating to the Merger Agreement,  including, without limitation,
obligations under applicable securities laws. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



   | d.| Indemnity.  Parent and the Securityholder Representative (solely
on behalf of the Securityholders  and in his capacity as the Securityholder
Representative, not in its individual capacity)  shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Acquiom and its affiliates and their respective  successors,
assigns, agents, securityholders, directors, officers and employees (the  "
_Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, 
liabilities, out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including, without limitation,
the reasonably  documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of outside counsel
or experts) (collectively  " _Losses_ "), arising out of or in connection
with (i) Acquiom's  execution and performance of its duties under this
Agreement, administration of the Paying  Account, the enforcement of any
rights or remedies under or in connection with this Agreement,  or as may
arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the Indemnitee, except in 
the case of any Indemnitee to the extent that such Losses have been primarily
caused  by the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
Indemnitee, (ii) Acquiom  following any instructions or other directions,
including any Payment Spreadsheet, whether  joint or singular and whether
contained herein or separately delivered, from the Parties,  except to the
extent that its following any such instruction or direction is expressly 
forbidden by the terms hereof, or (iii) any actions taken by the Parties
hereunder. The  indemnity obligations provided for in this Section shall
survive the resignation, replacement  or removal of Acquiom and the
termination of this Agreement. Solely as between Parent  and the
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders), the costs
and  expenses of the obligations contained in this Section 5(d) shall be
borne 50% by Parent  and 50% by the Securityholder Representative (solely on
behalf of the Securityholders). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | e.| Succession.  Acquiom may resign and be discharged from its duties
or obligations hereunder by giving  thirty (30) days advance notice in
writing of such resignation to the Parties specifying  a date when such
resignation shall take effect. Additionally, the Parties may terminate  and
discharge Acquiom from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving thirty
(30)  days advance joint written notice of such termination to Acquiom
specifying a date when  such termination shall take effect. Acquiom's sole
responsibility after such thirty  (30) day notice period expires shall be to
cause the delivery of any funds remaining  in the Paying Account or any
undelivered Survivor Units or Warrants to an account designated  by Parent
and the Securityholder Representative. Any entity into which Acquiom may be 
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated shall be the payments
administrator  under this Agreement without further act, and Acquiom may
assign its rights and obligations  under this Agreement to any entity to
which all or substantially all the payments administration  business may be
transferred. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | f.| Authorized  Persons. The persons identified in _Exhibit B_ are
authorized to take action  or execute documents on behalf of the applicable
party set forth therein or to take any  such other actions on behalf of such
party as may be set forth herein. All such instructions  to, and requests of,
Acquiom shall be subject to _Section 5(c)(i)_ and (ii) on behalf  of Parent
must be in writing and signed by any one of the persons designated on
_Exhibit  B_ as a representative of Parent or (ii) on behalf of the
Securityholder Representative  must be in writing and signed by any one of
the persons designated on _Exhibit B_   as a representative of the
Securityholder Representative. No instruction or direction  shall be binding
upon Acquiom unless delivered in accordance with the previous sentence. 
Acquiom may rely on the continued authority of each of the persons designated
on _Exhibit  B_ until Acquiom has been duly notified of any updates to such
designated representatives  in accordance with _Section 5(b)_ (Notices). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



   | g.| Miscellaneous.  Except for changes to funds or, if applicable,
Survivor Units or Warrants, transfer instructions  and changes to the
authorized persons set forth in _Exhibit B_ , the provisions of  this
Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in
part,  only by a writing signed by Acquiom and the Parties. Except as
expressly provided in  this Agreement to the contrary, neither this Agreement
nor any right or interest of a  party hereunder may be assigned in whole or
in part without the prior consent of each  of the other Parties. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws  of the State of
Delaware. Each Party irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds  of
venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to
service  of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable
law and agrees that  any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising
out of or relating to this Agreement  that are not resolved by agreement of
the parties shall be exclusively resolved in the  state and federal courts
located in the State of Delaware. Each Party further waives  any right to a
trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising  out
of or relating to this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute  one and the same instrument. The Parties
hereby consent to conducting business electronically  and all signatures of
the Parties to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or  email or
other electronic or digital means, and such facsimile, email or other
electronic  delivery will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original
signature of such Party  whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding
upon such Party. Following the Closing  Date and the public announcement of
the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement,  Acquiom may make
reference to Parent and the Company as customers of Acquiom and may  disclose
that it is serving as payments administrator in connection with such
transaction.  If any provision of this Agreement is reasonably determined to
be prohibited or unenforceable  by reason of any applicable law of a
jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such  jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without 
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability  in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provisions in  any other jurisdiction. Except for SunTrust
and its successors or assigns, whom the Parties  expressly acknowledge is a
third-party beneficiary under this Agreement, a person who  is not a party to
this Agreement shall have no right to enforce any term of this Agreement. 
Unless otherwise directed by Parent,  any _de minimis_ amounts attributable
to rounding discrepancies may be added to  or deducted from payments made to
the largest Securityholder. Upon completion  of all distributions required
hereunder as contemplated by _Exhibit E_ , this Agreement  shall terminate
except for those provisions which, by their express terms, survive such 
termination. Unless otherwise specified herein, any instructions to Acquiom
shall be  in a writing signed by both of the Parties. The individual signing
below on behalf of  a party is authorized by that party to execute this
Agreement on behalf of that party  and to legally and validly bind that party
to the terms of this Agreement.

Schedule I

  



  

ACQUIOM PAYMENTS TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  



  

The parties agree that Acquiom shall perform the services and be subject to
the terms set forth in this _Schedule I_.

  



  

1\. Duties. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and this _Schedule I_ ,
Acquiom shall administer payments in accordance with the applicable Payment
Spreadsheet (as defined below) and payee's payment instructions following
completion of the administrative processes described in this Agreement.

  



  

2\. Disbursements from Paying Account and Transfers from the Closing
Consideration Deposit. Subject to any applicable backup
withholding requirements and conditioned upon the receipt of all executed
documents required by Acquiom in accordance with the provisions of applicable
law, the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, Acquiom shall (i) direct
SunTrust to process payments from the Paying Account (each a " _Payment_ ")
and (ii) mail the Survivor Units or Warrants (" _Equity Distributions_ ")
from the Equity Closing Consideration Deposit, or _as otherwise delivered to
Acquiom by Parent or Parents 's transfer agent from time to time, as
applicable,_ to the Securityholders or to third parties, in each case as set
forth in written flow of funds or disbursement instructions (containing a
certificate-by-certificate breakdown of payments or Equity Distributions, as
applicable, to Securityholders in a form acceptable to Acquiom) delivered to
Acquiom at or prior to the Closing Date by the Securityholder Representative
and attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Closing Payment Spreadsheet_ "),
or with respect to any Equity Distributions after the Closing Date, pursuant
to joint written instructions (" _Joint Instructions_ ") signed and delivered
by Parent and the Securityholder Representative subsequent to the Closing
Date to Acquiom. The Securityholder Representative shall deliver to Acquiom a
preliminary Payment Spreadsheet (the " _Initial Payment Spreadsheet_ ") with
payees (including optionholders), payment instructions, certificate numbers
and security quantities, if applicable, and email or physical addresses for
each such payee and such other information required to solicit and verify
letters of transmittal, if such service is requested (but without final
Payment amounts) by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the date Acquiom is requested to solicit materials pursuant to
_Section 4(a)_ below, if applicable (along with the required letter of
transmittal and related documentation, if any, for such payees); provided that
the final Payment Spreadsheet (with final Payment amounts) is delivered by
the Securityholder Representative no later than three (3) Business Days prior
to the date Acquiom is requested by Parent pursuant to written disbursement
instructions delivered by Parent to Acquiom to begin making distributions.
The final Payment Spreadsheet shall be deemed to replace and supersede the
Initial Payment Spreadsheet. Any subsequent Payments or Equity Distributions,
as applicable shall be made in accordance with Joint Instructions delivered
to Acquiom by the Securityholder Representative and Parent (any such
instructions, a " _Subsequent Payment Spreadsheet_ " and together with the
Closing Payment Spreadsheet, a " _Payment Spreadsheet_ "). The Securityholder
Representative and Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, include in
each Payment Spreadsheet the name of the payee, the amount to be paid, and if
known, the payee's email and physical addresses, and for any third party
payees, payment instructions for such third parties. The Payment Spreadsheet
must also include any additional and available information to verify letters
of transmittal and complete required cost basis tax reporting. Acquiom shall
direct SunTrust to initiate payment and deliver to each Securityholder and
applicable third party of their allocated amount(s) no later than two (2)
Business Days after receipt (if received by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on
the date of receipt) of the applicable Payment Spreadsheet and all required
and proper documentation (including, if applicable, requisite tax
documentation and a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal) from
such payee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiom,
provided sufficient available final funds, Survivor Units or Warrants,
as applicable have been deposited into the Paying Account no later than 12:00
p.m. Eastern Time on such date of payment, there exist no other circumstances
that would require Acquiom to suspend payment to any Securityholder and
Acquiom receiving final written instructions from Parent to commence payment;
provided further that Parent shall provide to Acquiom prior to the Closing
Date final written instructions for payments to be made on the Closing Date to
payees for whom all applicable documentation has been provided prior to the
Closing Date, and Acquiom shall exercise all commercially reasonable efforts
to effect the initiation of payments to such payees on the Closing Date. The
Securityholder Representative represents to Acquiom that the securities in
exchange for which payment is being made hereunder do not constitute "covered
securities" under applicable IRS rules. Acquiom will cause electronic
payments to be made from the Paying Account and will cause checks to be
issued that are drawn on the Paying Account for payments to be made in the
form of a check, and such Payments shall only be made or permitted in
accordance with Payment Spreadsheets delivered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and payment instructions delivered by the applicable payee.
Acquiom will mail Equity Distributions from the Closing Consideration Deposit
and Acquiom will mail such Survivor Units and Warrants to the applicable
Securityholders and such mailings shall only be made or permitted in
accordance with Payment Spreadsheets delivered in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and mailing instructions delivered by the applicable payee;
provided Parent has delivered or has caused to be delivered to Acquiom such
Survivor Units or Warrants, as applicable, issued in the name of such
Securityholder. Acquiom is hereby relieved from any liability to the Parties
or any Securityholder or payee for any such acts done or payments made
in accordance with such Payment Spreadsheets and payment instructions. If the
Acquiom Compensation Payments service option is not selected, then with
respect to any Payments required to be treated as employee compensation for
income or employment tax purposes, Acquiom will process such payments to
Parent for distribution to each such payee, pursuant to the
payment instructions set forth on _Exhibit D_.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3\. Tax Reporting and Withholding. With respect to distributions from the
Paying Account to U.S. persons (actual or presumed), Acquiom shall complete
any tax reporting required by U.S. law of Acquiom, which, as of the date of
this Agreement, shall be limited to IRS 1099-B forms. To the extent payments
made hereunder to U.S. persons (actual or presumed) are identified on
the Payment Spreadsheet as dividends, interest or other income not otherwise
reportable on IRS 1099-B forms, Parent acknowledges and agrees that Parent or
the Company, as applicable, shall be solely responsible and liable for any tax
reporting in connection with such payments, unless otherwise set forth on
_Exhibit F_. Unless otherwise set forth on _Exhibit F_ , with respect to
distributions from the Paying Account to any securityholders who demonstrate
their status as nonresident aliens in accordance with United States Treasury
Regulations (" _Foreign Securityholders_ ") which are identified on the
Payment Spreadsheet as dividends, interest or other reportable income, Acquiom
is hereby directed to report such payments to such Foreign Securityholder
payees on IRS Form 1042-S using Parent's or the Company's tax identification
number, as appropriate. Acquiom shall deliver a copy of such completed tax
forms to enable Parent or Company, as applicable, to include such payment
amounts in its annual Form 1042 filing with the IRS. Unless otherwise set
forth on _Exhibit F_ , with respect to distributions from the Paying Account
to Foreign Securityholders which are identified on the Payment Spreadsheet as
dividends, interest or other reportable income, Parent hereby acknowledges and
agrees that such payments constitute domestic sourced income for which
withholding is required. Acquiom is hereby directed to withhold from
such distributions and retain in the Paying Account applicable withholding
amounts (as set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet or as otherwise directed by
Parent) and shall cause such amounts for taxes to be remitted from the Paying
Account to the appropriate authorities on Parent's or the Company's tax
identification number, as appropriate. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees
that no payment made hereunder to a Securityholder or vendor constitutes
foreign sourced income. Acquiom shall not be responsible for preparing or
filing, or causing to be prepared or filed, any tax reporting related
to distributions that are treated as compensation income. To the extent that
Acquiom becomes liable for the payment of any withholding or employment taxes
or related amounts payable in respect of payments made hereunder, it shall be
indemnified as set forth herein.

  



  

   

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4\. Terms Applicable to Distributions to Securityholders.

  



   | a.| Documents  Delivered to and Received from Securityholders. The
Company will deliver electronically  or by mail to each Securityholder at the
email address or physical address for such Securityholder  set forth in the
Payment Spreadsheet, as applicable, (i) a letter of transmittal instructing 
such Securityholder of the procedure for submitting to the Company the letter
of transmittal  and, if required, the certificate or certificates (each, a "
_Certificate_ ")  representing the units of Company equity held by such
Securityholder (the " _Legacy  Units_ ") and/or such other documents required
by Parent to be returned by Securityholders  who held rights to acquire
Legacy Units (e.g. options or warrants) and who are entitled  to Payments
hereunder, and (ii) such other materials relating to the exchange as Parent 
shall furnish to the Company for such purpose. Prior to and as a condition of
receipt  of payment, such Securityholder shall have delivered to the Company,
and the Company  shall have delivered to Acquiom, (i) the letter of
transmittal, properly completed and  duly executed in accordance with the
instructions therein, (ii) subject to _Section  4(h)_ below, the
Certificate(s) representing the Legacy Units held by such Securityholder, 
and (iii) all other instruments and communications that the Parties require to
be submitted  to Acquiom in connection with the processing of such
Securityholder Payment, including,  if applicable, tax documents as set forth
in _Section 4(e)_ below (each such Securityholder  whose foregoing deliveries
have been accepted by Acquiom being referred to herein as  a " _Tendering
Securityholder_ "). Securityholders may update their electronic  payment
instructions or address for non-electronic payments by delivering written
notice  and verification of identity as may be requested to Acquiom and the
Parties, provided  that such updates must be received and acknowledged by
Acquiom at least one (1) Business  Day prior to any payment to such
Securityholder. Acquiom may display the logos of Parent  and the Company on
communications with Securityholders hereunder, solely in connection  with the
services provided by Acquiom under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b.| Date  Recording. Acquiom will record in its systems the date of
receipt of materials submitted  to Acquiom, including letters of transmittal
and other documents received from Securityholders. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | c.| Examination  of Documents. Acquiom shall examine the letters of
transmittal, Certificates, and  other documents received to ascertain
whether: (i) the letters of transmittal and other  documents appear to
Acquiom to have been completed and executed in accordance with the 
instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal, (ii) if applicable, the
Certificates  appear to Acquiom to have been properly surrendered and are in
proper form for transfer  in accordance with the instructions set forth in
the letter of transmittal, or in the  event any Certificate required to be
delivered has been lost, destroyed or stolen, the  documentation and
instruments described in _Section 4(h)_ below have been properly  delivered,
and (iii) the total number of Legacy Units evidenced by each letter of
transmittal  matches the number of the appropriate class or series of Legacy
Units or rights to acquire  Legacy Units for such Securityholder on the
Payment Spreadsheet, as updated by written  notice from the Securityholder
Representative to Acquiom and Parent from time to time. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | d.| Irregularities  in Documents. In the event Acquiom reasonably
determines that any letter of transmittal  or other document has been
improperly completed or executed, that any of the Certificates  received, if
applicable, are not in proper form, or that some other irregularity exists, 
Acquiom shall attempt to cause such irregularity to be corrected. As to any
irregularity  that Acquiom cannot resolve, Acquiom shall provide notice to
Parent for instructions  and final determination. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | e.| Tax  Documents. To the extent not included with the letter of
transmittal, Acquiom shall  request and obtain from each Securityholder,
before directing any Payment hereunder,  tax identification numbers by means
of a completed appropriate IRS Form W-9 or appropriate  IRS Form W-8 for
foreign person certification and other forms and documents that Acquiom  may
reasonably request. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | f.| Payment  in Another Name. If Payment is to be made to a person
other than the registered Securityholder,  Acquiom shall not process such
Payment until the required letter of transmittal documentation  has been
properly completed, including, without limitation, a signature guarantee by 
a guarantor participating in a medallion signature guarantee program at the
appropriate  guarantee level as set forth in the letter of transmittal, if
necessary, and the Securityholder  requesting such Payment has paid any
transfer or other taxes or governmental charges  required by reason of such
Payment in a name other than that of the registered holder,  and has
established to Acquiom's satisfaction that such tax or charge either has 
been paid or is not required to be paid, and the Parties have certified in
writing to  Acquiom that they agree with such payment to another person. Any
tax information required  to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service or
other tax authority with respect to  such Payment shall list the registered
holder as the payee. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | g.| Securityholder  Transfer of Escrow Interest. In the event that
Acquiom is advised by a Securityholder  or transferee of a permitted transfer
of an interest in any rights to any disbursements  hereunder to a successor
or assign prior to the Closing Date, Acquiom shall refer such  person to
Parent for verification of any such transfer, following which Parent shall 
provide an updated Payments Spreadsheet to Acquiom including such information.
In the  event that Acquiom is advised by a Securityholder or transferee of a
permitted transfer  of an interest in any rights to any disbursements
hereunder to a successor or assign  after the Closing Date, Acquiom shall (i)
notify the Parties of such alleged transfer,  (ii) request such
Securityholder or transferee, as applicable to provide supporting
documentation,  including, but not limited to a medallion guarantee
certifying such transfer or in the  absence of a medallion guarantee, Acquiom
shall request Parent to approve such transfer,  and (iii) notify the Parties
of the acceptance of the transfer. Thereafter, regardless  of whether the
prior Securityholder is listed on a Subsequent Payments Spreadsheet, Acquiom 
shall pay any proceeds to the transferee. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | h.| Delivery  of Certificates. If a Securityholder reports to Acquiom
that such Securityholder's  failure to surrender a Certificate is due to the
loss, destruction or wrongful taking  of the Certificate, Acquiom will
provide additional documentation necessary to be completed  in order to
effectively surrender the Legacy Units represented by such lost or destroyed 
Certificate, as applicable (including an affidavit of loss with standard
representations  regarding unencumbered ownership of the applicable
securities and an agreement by such  Securityholder to indemnify Acquiom for
any losses suffered in connection with any payments  to such Securityholder
related to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, each in  a form
acceptable to Acquiom). Acquiom, in its sole discretion, may require a
Securityholder  to provide a bond in customary form with respect to such
indemnity. No interest will  be paid on amounts due for such Legacy Units. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5\. Payments. Payments to any Securityholder hereunder shall be made by U.S.
domestic electronic check (ACH) to bank accounts domiciled in the United
States at no additional cost. If no electronic payment instructions are
provided by a Securityholder, such instruction is payable to an account
maintained by a U.S. financial institution that is not enabled for ACH, or
such instruction is payable to a financial institution account outside the
United States, any payments to that payee will be disbursed by check to the
address provided in the Securityholder's letter of transmittal (if
applicable). In lieu of an ACH payment or check, a payee may request that a
payment be sent by wire transfer. The applicable fees set forth on
_Exhibit E_ shall apply and will be deducted from any payments that require
such fees. For payee service charges retained in the Paying Account after
deduction from a payment, Acquiom is authorized to transfer such amounts to
itself, to be retained by Acquiom as compensation. All amounts referred to in
this Agreement are expressed in United States Dollars and all payments shall
be made in such dollars.

  



  

6\. Information and Reports.

  



   | a.| Monthly  Report. Acquiom shall deliver to the Parties a monthly
report in electronic form  of the documents presented for exchange and a list
of Securityholders for which payments  have to be made. Each such report
shall include the names of the Securityholders that  have validly surrendered
Legacy Units to Acquiom and the amount of cash paid in exchange  therefor
(previous, current month period and total). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b.| Maintaining  Records. Acquiom shall keep and maintain complete
and accurate ledgers showing all  Legacy Units surrendered and the amount of
cash paid and Survivor Units and Warrants  delivered in exchange therefor.
Upon making payment for Legacy Units, Acquiom shall mark  any Certificates it
receives as "cancelled" and return them, the completed  letters of
transmittal and other related documentation to Parent on behalf of the
Company.  Acquiom shall preserve the physical documents and instruments
described in _Section  4(a)_ as required by law or, if not required to be so
preserved, dispose of such physical  documents and instruments no earlier
than thirty (30) days following Acquiom's  receipt thereof. For greater
certainty, Acquiom shall preserve and not dispose of electronic  versions of
all documents received by it pursuant to _Section 4(a)_. Acquiom is 
authorized to cooperate with and furnish information to any organization or
its legal  representatives designated from time to time by the Parties in any
manner reasonably  requested by either of them. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

7\. Follow-Up Notices; Escheat.

  



   | a.| Follow-Up  Notice. If Acquiom is not requested to conduct the
delivery of letters of transmittal  and related materials as contemplated by
_Section 4(a)_ above, Parent shall, or  shall cause the Company to, provide
to Acquiom and the Securityholder Representative  a list of mailings to the
Securityholders that were sent by Parent or the Company or  their respective
attorneys or agents and that have been returned as undeliverable. On  or
about the date that is three months following the date of this Agreement,
Acquiom  shall provide to the Securityholder Representative a list of all
Securityholders who  have not yet become a Tendering Securityholder in
accordance with the requirements herein.  The Securityholder Representative
will use its good faith efforts, with such cooperation  from Acquiom and
Parent as may reasonably be requested, to attempt to locate such
Securityholders.  With respect to any Securityholders that are so located,
Acquiom shall attempt to deliver  a follow-up notice (including the same
materials as contemplated in _Section 4(a)_   above) to each such located
Securityholder at the updated contact information provided  by the
Securityholder Representative. With respect to any Securityholders that are
not  Tendering Securityholders as of the date that is nine (9) months
following the Closing  Date, Acquiom shall use its standard processes to
attempt to locate such Securityholders. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | b.| Uncashed  Checks; Return of Electronic Payments. Should any
payment processed by Acquiom from  the Paying Account, be returned or
rejected, or if a mailed check, Survivor Units or  Warrants are returned as
undeliverable, Acquiom shall promptly notify the intended recipient  of such
payment or delivery that payment or delivery was rejected, and seek to
obtain  updated payment instructions. In the event such intended recipient
cannot be contacted,  Acquiom shall notify the Parties in writing and the
Parties shall then cooperate to attempt  to contact the relevant payee for
updated payments instructions. Upon request of the  Securityholder
Representative, Acquiom will use its standard processes to attempt to  locate
the payee. Once updated payment instructions have been received by Acquiom
in  writing from the applicable payee, the payment shall be re-processed
within two (2) Business  Days. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | c.| Transfer  of Units; Escheat Services. If there are any
Securityholders who have not yet become  a Tendering Securityholder in
accordance with the requirements herein and who have not  otherwise been
located by Acquiom or the Parties, upon the first anniversary of the Closing 
Date (with respect to the Closing Consideration Deposit) or the first
anniversary of  the date subsequent amounts were deposited in the Paying
Account or the date Survivor  Units or Warrants were delivered to Acquiom by
Parent's transfer agent or Survivor  as applicable, in each case for
distribution to the Securityholders, such amounts shall  be distributed to
Parent to be held and disposed of by Parent in accordance with applicable 
law and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Acquiom shall
not be liable  to any party or other person for any cash from the Paying
Account delivered to a governmental  entity or public official pursuant to
Acquiom's good faith belief that such money  was so transmitted in accordance
with the terms of any applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar law.

TRANSMITTAL LETTER

  



  

TO SURRENDER UNITS OF

  



  

SEQUEL YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES, LLC

  



  

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 11, 2017
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Sequel Youth and Family Services,
LLC, an Iowa limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), Global Partner
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Sequel Acquisition,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ "), the Key Equityholders and John F. Ripley,
solely in his capacity as the representative of the Legacy Equityholders of
the Company (the " _Representative_ "), Acquisition Sub will be merged with
and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company as the Surviving
Entity. It is anticipated that the Merger will be effective in the first half
of calendar year 2017 and the date and time on which the Merger is completed
is referred to in this Transmittal Letter as the " _Effective Time_ ". Payment
of any merger consideration described further below is contingent on the
closing of the Merger Agreement and the effectiveness of the Merger, which may
or may not occur. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is
enclosed herein as _Exhibit A_.

  



  

You are receiving this Transmittal Letter because you are a record holder of
Class B Units of the Company (collectively, the " _Units_ "). Pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, upon the Effective Time of the Merger, all
Units outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will be cancelled and the
holders of such Units shall have the right to receive merger consideration in
the form of cash, the Equity (A-B) Consideration (as defined in the Merger
Agreement and described further below), warrants to purchase Common Stock of
Parent (" _Warrants_ "), and rights under certain agreements described further
below. Any cash that may be due in respect of your Units will be paid,
without interest.

  



  

As provided in the Merger Agreement, a portion of the merger consideration
payable or issuable with respect to your Units will be reduced by your share
of the escrow required by the Merger Agreement and a portion of the cash
payable with respect to your Units will be reduced by your share of a fund
available for use by the Representative pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement in his capacity as representative for the Legacy
Equityholders.

  



   



 



    



  

In order to exchange your Units for the merger consideration due to you in
connection with the Merger, you must deliver the following to the Payments
Administrator at the address set forth below, each of which is considered an
integral part of the Transmittal Letter:

  



   | 1.| a  properly completed and duly signed Transmittal Letter,
including a duly signed Release  and Joinder Agreement, attached hereto as
_Exhibit B;_ 
---|---|--- 
   | | 
  | 2.| certificate(s)  representing your Units (or an Affidavit of Lost
Certificate); and 
   | |

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January

Services, LLC, an Iowa limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), Global
Partner Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Sequel
Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ "), the Key Equityholders and John
F. Ripley, solely in his capacity as the representative of the Legacy
Equityholders of the Company (the " _Representative_ "), pursuant to which
Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "),
with the Company as the Surviving Entity. Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the undersigned holder (the "
_Legacy Equityholder_ ") of Class B Units of the Company (the " _Units_ ")
hereby submits to the Company and/or Acquiom Clearinghouse LLC (the "
_Payments Administrator_ ") this Transmittal Letter, and surrenders the
original unit certificates (" _Certificates_ ") formerly representing the
Legacy Equityholder's right, title and interest to the Units held by the
Legacy Equityholder immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for
the consideration provided in the Merger Agreement.

  



       | 1.  | _Payment of Merger Consideration and Reduction
for Escrow Contribution_. The Legacy Equityholder hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the Merger Agreement requires 400,000 Class B Units of the
Surviving Entity (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") to be deposited in an
indemnification escrow account and $1,000,000 of the cash consideration (the
" _Representative Fund_ ") to be deposited with the Escrow Agent to be
disbursed in accordance with Sections 5.17 and 7.5 of the Merger Agreement.
The Legacy Equityholder hereby acknowledges that holders of Units must
participate in the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Representative Fund in
accordance with their Pro Rata Portions which is determined by dividing the
Equity (A-B) Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to be
received by the Legacy Equityholder by the Equity (AB) Consideration to be
received by all Legacy Equityholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
The Legacy Equityholder hereby agrees that the aggregate number of Class B
Units of the Surviving Entity issuable in respect of each Unit held by the
Legacy Equityholder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be reduced
by the Legacy Equityholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnity Escrow 
---|---|--- 
    



  

   



 



    

     



  

Amount. The Legacy Equityholder hereby agrees that the aggregate amount of
cash payable in respect of each Unit held by the Legacy
Equityholder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be reduced by (a)
the Legacy Equityholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Representative Fund, and
(b) applicable withholding taxes. The Legacy Equityholder hereby agrees that
the net amount of the merger proceeds payable to the Legacy Equityholder
shall be paid to the Legacy Equityholder in accordance with the payment
instructions indicated below and that the Class B Units of the Surviving
Entity issuable to the Legacy Equityholder (net of the Legacy
Equityholder's contribution to the Indemnity Escrow Amount) shall be issued
in the name of the Legacy Equityholder by the Company.

  



   | 2.| _Escrow  Arrangements_. The Legacy Equityholder understands and
agrees that Units in the Indemnity  Escrow Account will be used to satisfy
post-Closing claims, if any, by the Parent Indemnified  Parties. The Legacy
Equityholder understands that the Indemnity Escrow Account (less  claims paid
and a reserve for asserted but unresolved claims) shall be released and
issued  to applicable equityholders on the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing. The Legacy Equityholder  understands and agrees that the
Representative shall have sole control of withdrawals  from, or other
decisions with respect to, the Representative Fund, and that such funds  may
be used for (i) expenses incurred in performing its duties as the
Representative  (including, without limitation, as "TRA Representative" as
defined in, and  in accordance with, the Tax Receivable Agreement), (ii)
indemnification of the Representative  by the Legacy Equityholders under
agreements between the Representative and the Legacy  Equityholders, (iii)
satisfaction of any contribution claim the Representative has against  Legacy
Equityholders for any indemnification claims paid by the Representative in
excess  of such Representative's Pro Rata Portion of the Legacy Equityholders
as set forth  in Exhibit L of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) satisfaction of
any indemnification claims  by the Parent Indemnified Parties (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) against the Legacy  Equityholders. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Legacy Equityholder understands and agrees that any Class B Units of the
Surviving Entity from the Indemnity Escrow Account and any cash released from
the Representative Fund for the benefit of equityholders shall be distributed
to them on a pro rata basis in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions.

  



   | 3.| _Representations  and Warranties_. The Legacy Equityholder
hereby represents and warrants to the Company,  Parent and the Payments
Administrator as follows: 
---|---|--- 
  



       | a.  | The Legacy Equityholder is an individual, or is a
partnership, limited liability company or corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation or incorporation, as applicable. 
---|---|--- 
    



  

   

 | -2-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



      | b.| The  execution, delivery and performance of this
Transmittal Letter by the Legacy Equityholder  has been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the undersigned. 
---|---|--- 
   | | 
  | c.| The  Legacy Equityholder has all requisite power, authority, and
legal capacity to execute  and deliver this Transmittal Letter. This
Transmittal Letter, when duly and validly executed  and delivered by the
Legacy Equityholder, will constitute the legal, valid, and binding 
obligations of the Legacy Equityholder and will be enforceable against the
undersigned  in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, and similar laws
affecting creditors generally and by the  availability of equitable remedies. 
   | | 
  | d.| The  Legacy  Equityholder is the registered holder, as applicable,
of Units represented by the Certificates  noted below (the " _Securities_ ").
Other than the Sixth Amended and Restated  LLC Agreement of the Company,
dated as of October 13, 2016 (the " _Legacy Operating  Agreement_ "), which
will be, amended as set forth  in the Merger Agreement and then amended and
restated effective as of the Closing Date,  the Legacy Equityholder owns the
Securities, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances  (other than
restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws), valid title to the
Units  represented by the Certificate(s) delivered herewith, and the Legacy
Equityholder has  the full power, right, and authority to transfer the
Securities pursuant to the Merger.  The Units represented by such
Certificate(s) represent all of the Units held by the Legacy  Equityholder. 
   | | 
  | e.| The  Legacy Equityholder acknowledges that nothing in this
Transmittal Letter or any other  materials presented to the undersigned in
connection with the Merger constitutes legal,  tax or investment advice. The
Legacy Equityholder has consulted such legal, tax and investment  advisors as
the undersigned has deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with the 
undersigned's participation in the Merger. 
   | | 
  | f.| The  execution and delivery by the undersigned of this Transmittal
Letter 
  and the delivery and surrender of the Certificate(s) delivered herewith
will not (i)  violate (if the Legacy Equityholder is not a natural person)
any provision of the certificate  of incorporation, formation or limited
partnership or bylaws (or other governing document or instrument) of the
Legacy Equityholder, or (ii) violate any law or any judgment, decree, order,
regulation or rule of any court or other governmental body applicable to the
undersigned or the undersigned's properties or assets, including the Units. 
   | | 
  | g.| The  Legacy Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that the Equity
(A-B) Consideration, the  Cash Distribution, the Warrant Distribution and the
Agreements Distribution that are  payable to the Legacy Equityholder in
respect of the Legacy Equityholder's Units  pursuant to the Merger Agreement
are sufficient to satisfy the liquidation terms and  conditions of the Legacy
Operating Agreement. 
  



  

   

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    

     



       | h.  | The Legacy Equityholder understands that none of
the Class B Units of the Surviving Entity will be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") (subject to the
exchange rights under the Exchange Agreement). The Legacy Equityholder also
understands that the Class B Units of the Surviving Entity and the Warrants
are being offered pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in the
Securities Act based in part upon the following representations: 
---|---|--- 
   



    | i.| The  Legacy Equityholder is an "accredited investor" within the
meaning of Regulation  D promulgated under the Securities Act.1 If the Legacy
Equityholder is not  an "accredited investor", the Legacy Equityholder has
appointed and is relying  upon the advice of a purchaser representative
within the meaning of Rule 501(i) of Regulation  D under the Securities Act
(the " _Purchaser Representative_ "). 
---|---|--- 
   | | 
  | ii.| The  Legacy Equityholder is acquiring the Class B Units of the
Surviving Entity and the Warrants  for its own account for investment
purposes, and not with a view to, or for resale in  connection with, any
distribution thereof other than in compliance with the Securities  Act and
other applicable securities laws. The Legacy Equityholder (either alone or
with  the assistance of the Purchaser Representative) has such knowledge,
sophistication and  experience in business and financial matters as to be
capable of evaluating the merits,  risks and other considerations relating to
the acquisition and ownership of the Class  B Units of the Surviving Entity
and the Warrants. The Legacy Equityholder has made its  own evaluation
(either alone or with the assistance of the Purchaser Representative)  of the
merits, risks and other considerations relating to the acquisition and
ownership  of the Class B Units of the Surviving Entity and the Warrants and
the Legacy Equityholder  is able to bear the risks associated with the
acquisition and ownership thereof. 
   | | 
  | iii.| The  Legacy Equityholder acknowledges that Parent's common stock
is listed on The NASDAQ  Stock Market and Parent is required to file reports
containing certain business and financial  information with the SEC pursuant
to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and that Legacy Equityholder  is able to
obtain copies of 
  



  

  



  

     1  | For individuals, an  "accredited investor" is an individual
that (i) has a net worth (either individually or jointly  with his or her
spouse) in excess of $1,000,000 or (ii) has either (A) individual annual
income (exclusive of spousal  income) in excess of $200,000 or (B) has a
joint income with his or her spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of the two 
preceding tax years, and reasonably expects to have the same income level
(individually or jointly, as applicable) in the  current tax year; or (iii)
is a member of the board of directors or an executive officer of the Company.
The term "net  worth" means the excess of total assets at fair market value
(including personal and real property and including the  value of the Units
based on the consideration to be received pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
but excluding the estimated  fair market value of a person's primary home)
over total liabilities. 
---|---

---|---|--- 

 

    

     



  

such reports, including Parent's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. The Legacy
Equityholder acknowledges that the Class B Units of the Surviving Entity, even
if exchanged for Common Stock of Parent, and Warrants cannot be sold unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available.

  



       | iv.  | The Legacy Equityholder acknowledges and agrees
that the Class B Units of the Surviving Entity and the Warrants will be
"restricted" securities (as defined in Rule 144). The Legacy Equityholder is
aware of the provisions of Rule 144, which permit limited resale of shares
purchased in a private placement subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including, among other things: the availability of certain current
public information about Parent, the resale occurring following the required
holding period under Rule 144, and the number of shares being sold during any
period not exceeding specified limitations. 
---|---|--- 
    



  

In addition to the indemnification provided under the Merger Agreement as
affirmed herein, and without limiting any provision of the Merger Agreement,
the Legacy Equityholder agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Parent Indemnified Parties against and in respect of any and all Losses which
are directly suffered or incurred at any time by any Parent Indemnified Party
or to which any Parent Indemnified Party may otherwise directly become
subject at any time and which arise directly from or as a result of, or are
directly connected with, any inaccuracy in or breach by the Legacy
Equityholder of any representation or warranty contained in this Transmittal
Letter. Notwithstanding any provision of this Transmittal Letter, and in
addition to the obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Legacy
Equityholder is providing indemnity only with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties made by the Legacy Equityholder in this
Transmittal Letter and not those of any other equityholder, and the Legacy
Equityholder shall be liable only for the Losses for which the Legacy
Equityholder is providing indemnity under this indemnification section, and
no other equityholder shall be liable for any such Losses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Legacy Equityholder's aggregate liability with respect to the
indemnification obligations under this Transmittal Letter and the Merger
Agreement shall not exceed the proceeds received by the Legacy Equityholder
in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (except for the
Legacy Equityholder's fraud or intentional misrepresentation).

  



       | 5.  | _General Provisions_. 
---|---|--- 
    



       | a.  | By the execution and delivery of this Transmittal
Letter, the Legacy Equityholder acknowledges that the execution and delivery
of this Transmittal Letter is a condition to Parent's obligation to pay the
applicable portion of the merger consideration that would be payable or
issuable to the Legacy Equityholder pursuant to the Merger Agreement
and that Parent is relying on this Transmittal Letter in consummating the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
    



  

   

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



    

     

   | b.| Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this
Transmittal Letter, to the extent the provisions  contained in such sections
and in the Merger Agreement are inconsistent in any respect,  the provisions
contained in the Merger Agreement shall control. 
---|---|--- 
   | | 
  | c.| The  Legacy Equityholder agrees that this Transmittal Letter, the
Merger Agreement, the Related  Agreements, and the documents contemplated
hereby and thereby constitute the entire agreement  between the Company and
the Legacy Equityholder concerning the subject matter hereof.  No oral
statements or other prior written material not specifically incorporated
into  the foregoing shall be of any force and effect, and no changes in or
additions to this  Transmittal Letter shall be recognized, unless
incorporated into this Transmittal Letter  by written amendment, such
amendment to become effective on the date stipulated in it.  Any amendment to
this Transmittal Letter must be signed by the Legacy Equityholder, Parent 
and the Securityholder Representative. This document fully supersedes any and
all prior  oral or written agreements, understandings, promises,
representations or inducements  between the Company and the Legacy
Equityholder pertaining to the subject matter of this  Transmittal Letter.
Further, the Legacy Equityholder represents and acknowledges that  in
executing this Transmittal Letter, the Legacy Equityholder is not relying on,
and  has not relied on, any prior oral or written agreements, understandings,
promises, inducements,  or representations by the Company or its
representatives, except as expressly contained  in this Transmittal Letter,
the Merger Agreement, the Related Agreements, and the documents  contemplated
hereby and thereby and the Legacy Equityholder expressly disclaims any
reliance  on any prior oral or written agreements, understandings, promises,
inducements, or representations  in entering into this Transmittal Letter. 
   | | 
  | d.| This  Transmittal Letter shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the death or  incapacity of one or more of the undersigned,
and shall be binding upon the heirs, personal  representatives, successors,
and assignees of the Legacy Equityholder and shall not be  affected by, and
shall survive, the death or incapacity of the Legacy Equityholder. 
   | | 
  | e.| The  Legacy Equityholder understands that surrender is not made in
acceptable form until the  receipt by the Payments Administrator of this
Transmittal Letter, or a manually signed  facsimile hereof, properly
completed and duly signed, and of the Certificates, together  with all
accompanying evidences of authority and other documents referenced above and 
attached herewith in form satisfactory to the Company (or an Affidavit of Lost
Certificate).  All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any
surrender of Certificates hereby  will be determined by the Company and such
determination shall be final and binding. 
   | | 
  | f.| The  Legacy Equityholder understands that payment to the Legacy
Equityholder of the Legacy  Equityholder's portion of the merger
consideration which is payable at the Effective Time will be made as promptly
as practicable after this Transmittal Letter (together with the Legacy
Equityholder's Certificates) is delivered to the Payments Administrator in
acceptable form and only after and contingent upon the Closing of the Merger
Agreement (which the Legacy Equityholder understands may or may not occur).

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

  



  

A United States Holder (as defined below) of Units who is receiving any
consideration in connection with the Merger is required under United States
federal income tax law to provide the Payments Administrator with his, her or
its current taxpayer identification number (" _TIN_ ") on the Form W-9
included with this letter of transmittal. If such holder is an individual,
the TIN is his or her social security number. If the holder does not provide
the correct TIN or an adequate basis for an exemption, a penalty may be
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), and any consideration
such holder receives in the Merger may be subject to backup withholding at
the applicable rate (currently 28%). Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Rather, the U.S. federal income tax liability of persons
subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld
provided that the required information is provided to the IRS. If withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund from the IRS may be obtained. To
prevent backup withholding, a United States Holder is required to notify the
Payments Administrator of his or her correct TIN by completing the enclosed
Form W-9 and certifying under penalties of perjury that the TIN provided on
Form W-9 is correct. In addition, the holder must date and sign as indicated.
If the holder does not provide the Payments Administrator with a certified
TIN by the time of payment, backup withholding will apply.

  



  

To prevent backup withholding, holders that are not United States Holders
should (i) submit a properly completed and applicable IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS
Form W-8BEN-E, IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8EXP, or IRS Form W-8IMY (with
appropriate attachments) to the Payments Administrator, certifying under
penalties of perjury to the holder's foreign status or (ii) otherwise
establish an exemption. All of the IRS Forms W-8, or other applicable forms,
may be obtained from the Payments Administrator or from the IRS at its
Internet website: _www.irs.gov_.

  



  

Certain holders (including, among others, corporations and certain foreign
holders) are exempt recipients not subject to these backup withholding
requirements. To avoid possible erroneous backup withholding, exempt United
States Holders should complete and return the Form W-9.

  



  

For purposes of these instructions, a "United States Holder" is (i) an
individual who is a citizen or resident alien of the United States, (ii) a
corporation (including an entity taxable as a corporation) or partnership
created under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision
thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to United States
federal income tax regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (a) a court
within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust
has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be
treated as a U.S. person.

  



  

IN ALL CASES, TAX FORMS PREPARED AND ATTACHED TO THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
SHOULD BE COMPLETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE
SERVICE ATTACHED TO EACH FORM OR AVAILABLE AT _WWW.IRS.GOV_. PLEASE CONSULT
YOUR INDEPENDENT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, TAX OR FINANCIAL ADVISOR FOR FURTHER
QUESTIONS.

  



  

NOTE: FAILURE TO PROPERLY COMPLETE THE INFORMATION REQUESTED ON THE ATTACHED
SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9, IRS FORM W-8BEN, IRS FORM W-8BEN-E, IRS FORM W-8ECI, IRS
FORM W-8IMY or IRS FORM W-8EXP, AS APPLICABLE, MAY RESULT IN WITHHOLDING ON
ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO YOU.

Article II 
  
 EXCHANGES

  



  

Section 2.1. _Exchange of Class B Units for Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Monthly Elective Exchanges_.

  



  

(i) Beginning with the first Month following the date that is six (6) months
after the date of this Agreement, and subject to _Section 2.1(g)_ and
the adjustment as provided in this Agreement, each Holder shall be entitled
on any Monthly Exchange Date to surrender all or a portion of the Class B
Units held by such Holder to the Company (or, at the option of the
Corporation, directly to the Corporation) in exchange for the delivery by the
Corporation to the exchanging Holder of a number of shares of Common Stock
that is equal to the product of the number of Class B Units surrendered
_multiplied by_ the Exchange Rate (the " _Exchange Shares_ ");  _provided,
however_ , that Holder may exchange no less than the lesser of (A) the number
of Class B Units held by Holder and (B) One Thousand (1,000) Class B Units in
any one Monthly Exchange.

  



  

(ii) A Holder shall exercise its right to exchange Class B Units pursuant to
this _Section 2.1(a)_ by delivering to the Company, with a
contemporaneous copy delivered to the Corporation, in each case during normal
business hours at the principal executive offices of the Company and the
Corporation, respectively, (A) a written election of exchange in respect of
the Class B Units to be exchanged substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_
hereto (an " _Exchange Notice_ "), at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Monthly Exchange Date for the applicable Month or within such shorter period
of time as may be agreed upon by the Corporation and the exchanging Holder,
duly executed by such Holder; (B) any certificates representing such Class B
Units on the Monthly Exchange Date, together with a written assignment and
acceptance agreement with respect to such Class B Units, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Corporation; and (C) if the Corporation or the Company
requires the delivery of the certification contemplated by _Section 2.4(b)_
, such certification or written notice from such Holder that it is unable to
provide such certification on the Monthly Exchange Date.

(iii) Upon a Holder exercising its right to a Monthly Exchange, the
Corporation and the Company shall take such actions as may be required to
ensure that such Holder receives the shares of Common Stock that such
exchanging Holder is entitled to receive in connection with such Monthly
Exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_. Unless the Corporation elects to
acquire directly the Class B Units such Holder is requesting to be exchanged
in connection with a Monthly Exchange, (A) the Corporation shall be deemed to
have transferred the Common Stock to be delivered to the exchanging Holder to
the Company and the Company shall issue to the Corporation a number of
Class B Units in the Company equal to the number of Class B Units exchanged
by the Holder and (B) the Company shall be deemed to have transferred such
Common Stock to the exchanging Holder in exchange for the Class B Units
surrendered by such Holder in the Monthly Exchange. If an exchanging Holder
receives the shares of Common Stock that it is entitled to receive in
connection with a Monthly Exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_
directly from the Corporation, the Holder shall have no further right to
receive shares of Common Stock from the Company in connection with that
Monthly Exchange, and the Corporation and the Company shall be deemed to have
satisfied their obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_. On the Monthly Exchange Date, all rights of the exchanging
Holder as a holder of the Class B Units that are subject to the Monthly
Exchange shall cease, and such Holder shall be treated for all purposes as
having become the record holder of any shares of Common Stock to be received
by the exchanging Holder in respect of such Monthly Exchange.

  



  

(b) _Exchanges upon an Employment Termination_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.1(a)_ to the contrary, upon the
termination for any reason of employment of any Holder who is, as of the date
hereof, an employee of the Corporation the Company, or any of the Subsidiaries
(a " _Terminated Holder_ "), all Class B Units held by such Terminated Holder
shall be automatically exchanged for a number of shares of Common Stock that
is equal to the product of the number of Class B Units surrendered
_multiplied by_ the Exchange Rate (any such exchange, a " _Termination
Exchange_ "). The date of termination with respect to such Terminated Holder
shall be the " _Termination Exchange Date_ ".

  



  

(ii) In connection with a Termination Exchange, a Terminated Holder shall
deliver to the Company, with a contemporaneous copy delivered to the
Corporation, in each case during normal business hours at the principal
executive offices of the Company and the Corporation, respectively, (A) a
written Exchange Notice, (B) any certificates representing such Class B Units
at the Termination Exchange Date held by the Terminated Holder, together with
a written assignment and acceptance agreement with respect to such Class B
Units, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Corporation; and (C) if the
Corporation or the Company requires the delivery of the certification
contemplated by _Section 2.4(b)_ , such certification or written notice from
such Terminated Holder that it is unable to provide such certification.

  



  

   

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Upon a Termination Exchange, the Corporation and the Company shall take
such actions as may be required to ensure that such Terminated Holder
receives the shares of Common Stock that such exchanging Terminated Holder is
entitled to receive in connection with such Termination Exchange pursuant to
this _Section 2.1(b)_. Unless the Corporation elects to directly acquire the
Class B Units such Terminated Holder is exchanging in connection with a
Termination Exchange, (A) the Corporation shall be deemed to have transferred
the Common Stock to be delivered to the exchanging Terminated Holder to the
Company and the Company shall issue to the Corporation a number of Class B
Units in the Company equal to the number of Class B Units exchanged by the
Terminated Holder and (B) the Company shall be deemed to have transferred
such Common Stock received from the Corporation to the exchanging Terminated
Holder in exchange for the Class B Units surrendered by such Terminated
Holder in the Termination Exchange. If an exchanging Terminated Holder
receives the shares of Common Stock that it is entitled to receive in
connection with a Termination Exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)_
from the Corporation, the Terminated Holder shall have no further right to
receive shares of Common Stock from the Company in connection with that
Termination Exchange, and the Corporation and the Company shall be deemed to
have satisfied their obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
2.1(b)(iii)_. Immediately prior to the occurrence of the Termination
Exchange, all rights of the exchanging Terminated Holder as a holder of the
Class B Units that are subject to the Termination Exchange shall cease, and
such Terminated Holder shall be treated for all purposes as having become the
record holder of any shares of Common Stock to be received by the exchanging
Terminated Holder in respect of such Termination Exchange.

  



  

(c) _Exchanges upon a Change of Control_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.1(a)_ to the contrary,
immediately prior to the occurrence of any Change of Control, all Class B
Units shall be automatically exchanged for a number of shares of Common Stock
that is equal to the product of the number of Class B Units surrendered
_multiplied by_ the Exchange Rate (any such exchange, a " _Change of Control
Exchange_ ").

  



  

(ii) To the extent practicable, the Corporation shall deliver to each Holder
at least fifteen (15) Business Days' prior written notice of any event
resulting in a Change of Control, and the expected date on which such Change
of Control shall be deemed to occur (the " _Change of Control Exchange Date_
"). In connection with a Change of Control Exchange, a Holder shall deliver to
the Company, with a contemporaneous copy delivered to the Corporation, in
each case during normal business hours at the principal executive offices of
the Company and the Corporation, respectively, (A) a written Exchange Notice,
(B) any certificates representing such Class B Units on the Change of Control
Exchange Date, together with a written assignment and acceptance agreement
with respect to such Class B Units, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation; and (C) if the Corporation or the Company requires the
delivery of the certification contemplated by _Section 2.4(b)_ , such
certification or written notice from such Holder that it is unable to provide
such certification on the Change of Control Exchange Date.

  



  

   

 | -6-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Upon a Change of Control Exchange, the Corporation and the Company
shall take such actions as may be required to ensure that such Holder receives
the shares of Common Stock that such exchanging Holder is entitled to receive
in connection with such Change of Control Exchange pursuant to this _Section
2.1(c)_. Unless the Corporation elects to directly acquire the Class B Units
such Holder is exchanging in connection with a Change of Control Exchange,
(A) the Corporation shall be deemed to have transferred the Common Stock to
be delivered to the exchanging Holder to the Company and the Company shall
issue to the Corporation a number of Class B Units in the Company equal to
the number of Class B Units exchanged by the Holder and (B) the Company shall
be deemed to have transferred such Common Stock received from the Corporation
to the exchanging Holder in exchange for the Class B Units surrendered by such
Holder in the Change of Control Exchange. If an exchanging Holder receives
the shares of Common Stock that it is entitled to receive in connection with
a Change of Control Exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ from the
Corporation, the Holder shall have no further right to receive shares of
Common Stock from the Company in connection with that Change of Control
Exchange, and the Corporation and the Company shall be deemed to have
satisfied their obligations under the first sentence of this
_Section 2.1(c)(iii)_. Immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of
Control, all rights of the exchanging Holder as a holder of the Class B Units
that are subject to the Change of Control Exchange shall cease, and such
Holder shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder
of any shares of Common Stock to be received by the exchanging Holder in
respect of such Change of Control Exchange.

  



  

(d) _Issuance of Common Stock_. As promptly as practicable following
satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ ,
_Section 2.1(b)(ii)_ , or _Section 2.1(c)(ii)_ , as applicable, and in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days after such obligations are
satisfied, the Corporation or the Company, as applicable, shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to such Holder, at the address set forth on such
Holder's signature page to the LLC Agreement (or at such other address as such
party may designate to the Corporation), the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable to such Holder upon such Exchange, if any, registered in the name
of the relevant exchanging Holder, subject to the Holder's execution of any
letter of transmittal or other document required to be executed by the
holders of Common Stock. To the extent the Common Stock is settled through the
facilities of The Depository Trust Company, the Corporation or the Company,
as applicable, will upon the written instruction of an exchanging
Holder, deliver the shares of Common Stock deliverable to such exchanging
Holder, through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, to the
account of the participant of The Depository Trust Company designated by such
exchanging Holder in the Exchange Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Common Stock shall be
issued as a result of any Exchange. In lieu of any fractional share of Common
Stock to which a Holder would otherwise be entitled in any Exchange,
the Company or the Corporation, as applicable, shall pay to such Holder cash
equal to such fraction multiplied by the Fair Market Value as of the Monthly
Exchange Date, the Termination Exchange Date or the Change of Control Exchange
Date, as applicable.

  



  

   

 | -7-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Expenses_. The Corporation, the Company, and each exchanging Holder
shall bear its own expenses in connection with the consummation of any
Exchange, whether or not any such Exchange is ultimately consummated, except
that the Company shall bear any transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or
other similar taxes as well as any other expenses incurred by the Corporation
in connection with, or arising by reason of, any Exchange; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any shares of Common Stock are to be delivered in a name
other than that of the Holder that requested the Exchange, then such Holder
or the Person in whose name such shares are to be delivered shall pay to the
Company the amount of any transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or other
similar taxes in connection with, or arising by reason of, such Exchange or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company that such tax
has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(f) _Publicly Traded Partnership_. Each of the Corporation and the Company
covenants and agrees that neither shall take or cause or permit to be taken
any action that would cause interests in the Company to not meet the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Board or the board of
managers of the Company, as applicable, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and tax advisor, shall determine in good faith that, despite
adherence by the Corporation and the Company to the foregoing, additional
restrictions must be imposed on Exchanges in order for the Company not to be
treated as a "publicly traded partnership" under Section 7704 of the Code,
the Corporation or the Company, as applicable, may impose such
restrictions on Exchanges, as the Corporation or the Company, as applicable,
may reasonably determine to be necessary or advisable.

  



  

(g) _Other Prohibitions on Exchange_. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Holder shall not be
entitled to exchange Class B Units to the extent that the Corporation or the
Company reasonably determines in good faith that the Exchange (i) would be
prohibited by any Applicable Law (including the unavailability of any
requisite registration statement filed under the Securities Act or any
exemption from the registration requirements thereunder) or (ii) would not be
permitted under any other agreement with the Corporation, its subsidiaries,
the Company or the Subsidiaries to which such Holder is then subject
(including the LLC Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, no Exchange shall
be deemed to be prohibited by any Applicable Law pertaining to the
registration of securities if such securities have been so registered or if
any exemption from such registration requirements is reasonably available,
and the parties hereto believe that there is currently no law, regulation,
injunction, order or decree of any nature and acknowledge that there is no
agreement of the type referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence,
that would, in either case, restrict the ability of a Holder to exchange
Class B Units.

Section 2.2. _Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) The Exchange Rate shall be adjusted accordingly if there is: (i) any
subdivision (by any unit split, unit distribution, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse
unit split, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or
otherwise) of the Class B Units that is not accompanied by an identical
subdivision or combination of the Common Stock; or (ii) any subdivision (by
any stock split, stock dividend or distribution, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse
stock split, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise)
of the Common Stock that is not accompanied by an identical subdivision or
combination of the Class B Units. For example, if there is a 2 for 1 stock
split of Common Stock and no corresponding split with respect to the Class B
Units, the Exchange Rate would be adjusted to be 2. To the extent not
reflected in an adjustment to the Exchange Rate, if there is any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction in which the Common Stock are converted or changed into another
security, securities or other property, then upon any subsequent Exchange, an
exchanging Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such security,
securities or other property that such exchanging Holder would have received
if such Exchange had occurred immediately prior to the effective date of such
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, taking into account any adjustment as a result of any
subdivision (by any split, distribution or dividend, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by
reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of such
security, securities or other property that occurs after the effective time
of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is any reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the
Common Stock are converted or changed into another security, securities or
other property, this _Section 2.2_ shall continue to be applicable,
_mutatis mutandis_ , with respect to such security or other property.

  



  

(b) Each time that the Corporation acquires Class B Units other than in
connection with a corresponding issuance by the Corporation of the same number
of shares of Common Stock (whether as a result of an Exchange or otherwise)
or a concurrent recapitalization of the Company that causes the number of
Class B Units held by the Corporation to equal the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately following such purchase of Class B Units
(subject, in any such case, to prior applications of this _Section 2.2(b)_ ),
the Exchange Rate shall be adjusted immediately following such transaction,
without any further action by the Corporation or any Holder, as follows: the
Exchange Rate shall first be set at a ratio, the numerator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation then-outstanding and
the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of Class A Units plus
Class B Units then-owned by the Corporation, in each case after giving effect
to the transaction that gave rise to such Exchange Rate adjustment and prior
to giving effect to any event that has occurred which would give rise to an
adjustment to the Exchange Rate pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ , and then that
ratio shall be adjusted as set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ for each event (if
any) giving rise to such _Section 2.2(a)_ adjustment assuming that such
event had occurred after the transaction that gave rise to the Exchange Ratio
adjustment being made hereby.

  



  

(c) The Corporation shall not pay a dividend or otherwise make a distribution
of cash or other property in respect of shares of Common Stock if such
cash or other property was not received by the Corporation as a distribution
from the Company, either directly or indirectly through a wholly owned
subsidiary.

Section 2.3. _Common Stock to be Issued_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the
Corporation and the Company covenant and agree to deliver shares of Common
Stock that have been registered under the Securities Act with respect to any
Exchange to the extent that a registration statement is effective and
available for such shares. In the event that any Exchange in accordance with
this Agreement is to be effected at a time when any such registration has not
become effective or otherwise is unavailable, the Corporation shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly facilitate such Exchange pursuant
to any reasonably available exemption from such registration
requirements. When and if the Common Stock is registered under the Securities
Act, the Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to list
the Common Stock required to be delivered upon Exchange prior to such delivery
on each national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on
which the outstanding Common Stock may be listed or traded at the time of such
delivery. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude the
Corporation or the Company from satisfying their obligations in respect
of the exchange of the Class B Units by delivery of Common Stock which are
unregistered under the Securities Act or held in the treasury of the
Corporation or the Company or any of their subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall
be construed as a requirement for the Corporation or the Company to settle
the exchange for cash. The Corporation shall not be required to comply with
this _Section 2.3(a_ ) in an Exchange in connection with a Change of
Control.

  



  

(b) The Corporation reserves the right to cause certificates evidencing such
Common Stock to be imprinted with legends as to restrictions on transfer that
it may deem necessary or appropriate, including legends as to applicable U.S.
federal or state securities laws or other legal or contractual restrictions,
and may require any Holder to which Common Stock are to be issued to agree in
writing (i) that such shares of Common Stock will not be transferred except
in compliance with such restrictions and (ii) to such other matters as the
Corporation may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate in light of
applicable law and existing agreements.

  



  

(c) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance
upon an Exchange, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be
deliverable upon any such Exchange; _provided_ that nothing contained herein
shall be construed to preclude the Corporation from satisfying its obligations
in respect of any such Exchange by delivery of purchased shares of Common
Stock (which may or may not be held in the treasury of the Corporation or any
subsidiary thereof).

  



  

(d) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Corporation has taken all such
steps as may be required to cause to qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d)
or (e), as applicable, under the Exchange Act, and be exempt for purposes of
Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, any acquisitions or dispositions of
equity securities of the Corporation (including derivative securities with
respect thereto) and any securities which may be deemed to be equity
securities or derivative securities of the Corporation for such purposes that
result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each director
or officer of the Corporation who may reasonably be expected to be subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Corporation upon the registration of any class of equity security of
the Corporation pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act (with the
authorizing resolutions specifying the name of each such officer or director
whose acquisition or disposition of securities is to be exempted and the
number of securities that may be acquired and disposed of by each such Person
pursuant to this Agreement).

  



  

(e) The Corporation covenants that all Common Stock issued upon an Exchange
will, upon issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not
subject to any preemptive right of stockholders of the Corporation or to any
right of first refusal or other right in favor of any Person.

Section 2.4. _Withholding; Certification of Non-Foreign Status_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporation or the Company shall be required to withhold any
amounts by reason of any federal, state, local or foreign tax rules or
regulations in respect of any Exchange, the Corporation or the Company, as
the case may be, shall be entitled to take such action as it
deems appropriate in order to ensure compliance with such withholding
requirements, including at its option withholding shares of Common Stock with
a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount of any taxes which the
Corporation or the Company, as the case may be, may be required to withhold
with respect to such Exchange, or requiring as a condition of any Exchange
that the exchanging Unit holder tender to the Company an amount equal to the
minimum amount of any taxes which the Corporation or the Company, as the
case may be, may be required to withhold with respect to such Exchange. To
the extent that amounts are (or property is) so withheld by the Company or
Corporation and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld
amounts (or property) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid (or delivered) to the applicable Holder. The parties
anticipate that, on the basis of current law, no federal income tax
withholding would be required with respect to an Exchange by any Holder who
is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code and who has properly certified that such holder is not subject to
federal backup withholding.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the Corporation
and the Company may, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, require as
a condition to the effectiveness of an Exchange that an exchanging Holder
deliver to the Corporation or the Company, as the case may be, a
certification of non-foreign status in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(b) or to provide any other applicable withholding
certificate. In the event the Corporation or the Company has required delivery
of such certification but an exchanging Holder is unable to comply, the
Corporation or the Company, as the case may be, shall nevertheless deliver or
cause to be delivered to the exchanging Holder the Common Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.1_ , but subject to withholding as provided in _Section
2.4(a)_.

  



  

Section 2.5. _Distributions_. No Exchange shall impair the right of the
Holder effecting an Exchange pursuant to this Agreement to receive any
distributions payable on the Class B Units so exchanged in respect of a
record date that occurs prior to the Exchange Date for such Exchange. No
adjustments in respect of dividends or distributions on any Class B Unit will
be made on the Exchange of any Class B Units, and if the Exchange Date with
respect to a Class B Unit occurs after the record date for the payment of a
dividend or other distribution on Class B Units but before the date of the
payment, then the registered Holder of the Class B Unit at the close of
business on the record date will be entitled to receive the dividend or other
distribution payable on the Class B Unit on the payment date notwithstanding
the Exchange of the Class B or a default in payment of the dividend or
distribution due on the Exchange Date, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no
Holder effecting an Exchange pursuant to this Agreement shall have the right
to receive any distributions (including tax distributions) on any exchanged
Class B Unit with a record date that occurs from and after any Exchange Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, no Holder effecting an Exchange pursuant to this
Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in respect of a single record date,
distributions or dividends both on Class B Units exchanged by such Holder and
on shares of Common Stock received by such Holder in such Exchange.

Article IV 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 4.1. _Additional Holders_. To the extent a Holder validly transfers
any or all of such holder's Class B Units to another Person in a
transaction in accordance with, and not in contravention of, the LLC
Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement, then such transferee (each, a
" _Permitted Transferee_ ") shall have the right to execute and deliver a
joinder to this Agreement in a form provided by the Corporation, whereupon

Section 4.8. _Severability_. It is expressly understood and agreed that if
any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to
any party or circumstance shall be determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of
this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any party or
circumstance other than those to which it is so determined to be invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision hereof shall
be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law so long as the economic or
legal substance of the matters contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares or finds that any term or provision
hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, or to
delete specific words or phrases, and to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If
such court of competent jurisdiction does not so replace an invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto will negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the matters contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

Person other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns.

  



  

Section 4.11. _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto are sophisticated and
have been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions
contemplated hereby who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a
consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules
relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any
particular clause should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument executed in connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

  



  

Section 4.12. _Rights and Remedies Cumulative_. The rights and remedies
provided by this Agreement are cumulative and the use of any one right
or remedy by any party shall not preclude or waive the right to use any or
all other remedies. Such rights and remedies are given in addition to any
other rights the parties may have by law, statute, ordinance or otherwise. No
failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant,
duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such
breach or any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

  



  

Section 4.13. _Amendment_. The provisions of this Agreement may be amended
only by the affirmative vote or written consent of each of (a) the
Corporation, (b) the Company and (c) as the Securityholder Representative;

partnership agreement of Company as described in Section 761(c) of the Code
and Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(h) and 1.761-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, for federal, state and local tax purposes, the Corporation, the
Company and the Holders shall report each Exchange consummated pursuant to
this Agreement, whether directly to the Corporation or to the Company, as a
taxable transfer of an interest in the Company to the Corporation eligible to
give rise to a Basis Adjustment (as such term is defined in the
Tax Receivable Agreement) and none of the Corporation, the Company or any
Holder shall take a contrary position on any tax return or otherwise unless
otherwise required pursuant to a determination within the meaning of Section
1313 of the Code.

  



  

Section 4.15. _Further Action_. Each party hereto shall execute, deliver,
acknowledge and file such other documents and take such further actions
as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the other party hereto to
give effect to and carry out the transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

Section 4.16. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto recognize that
irreparable injury will result from a breach of any provision of this
Agreement and that money damages will be inadequate to fully remedy the
injury. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of one or
more of the provisions of this Agreement, any party which may be injured (in
addition to any other remedies which may be available to that party) shall be
entitled (without the need to post any bond, surety, or other security) to one
or more preliminary or permanent orders (a) restraining and enjoining any act
which would constitute a breach or (b) compelling the performance of any
obligation which, if not performed, would constitute a breach. Each party
hereto further agrees that, in the event of any action for an injunction or
other equitable remedy in respect of such breach or enforcement of specific
performance, it will not assert the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

  



  

Section 4.17. _Independent Nature of Holders ' Rights and Obligations_. The
obligations of each Holder hereunder are several and not joint with
the obligations of any other Holder, and no Holder shall be responsible in
any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Holder under
hereunder. The decision of each Holder to enter into to this Agreement has
been made by such Holder independently of any other Holder. Nothing contained
herein, and no action taken by any Holder pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to
constitute the Holders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or
any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Holders are in any
way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the
transactions contemplated hereby and the Corporation acknowledges that the
Holders are not acting in concert or as a group, and the Corporation will not
assert any such claim, with respect to such obligations or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

on the average closing price of the Common Stock over 20 trading days
preceding the Demand Registration Notice (the " _Demand Registrable
Securities_ ") held by such Initiating Holder(s) on the date thereof (a "
_Demand Registration_ "), then the Corporation shall, subject to
the limitations of this _Section 2.1_ , use its commercially reasonable
efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of all such
Demand Registrable Securities that such Initiating Holder(s) request(s) to be
registered.

  



  

(b) The Demand Registration Notice shall specify (i) the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be registered, (ii) the anticipated per
share price range for such offering (which range may be revised from time to
time by the Initiating Holder(s) by written notice to the Corporation to that
effect), (iii) the intended methods of disposition and the name of the lead
underwriter, if any, and (iv) subject to _Section 2.1(e)_ , whether such
registration shall be a "shelf" registration pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act (a " _Shelf Registration_ ").

  



  

(c) Within 10 days after receipt of a Demand Registration Notice, the
Corporation shall give written notice (a " _Registration Notice_ ") of the
requested registration to all other Holders of Registrable Securities (the "
_Other Holders_ " and, together with the Initiating Holder(s), the "
_Demanding Holders_ "). The Registration Notice shall describe the amount
and type of securities being registered, the intended method(s) of
distribution and the name of the proposed managing underwriter, if any. The
Corporation shall include in such registration all Registrable Securities of
the same class as the Demand Registrable Securities with respect to which the
Corporation has received written requests from Other Holders (each of which
requests shall specify the Other Holder, the number of Registrable Securities
that such Other Holder elects to include in such registration and the
intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities) within 10 days
after the receipt of the Registration Notice. The Corporation shall, as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within 120 days after the date of
the Demand Registration Notice, file a Registration Statement under the
Securities Act covering (i) all Demand Registrable Securities, (ii) any
additional Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by any Other Holders, as specified by notice given timely by each
such Other Holders to the Corporation (the " _Member Registrable Securities_
"), (iii) any newly issued or treasury securities of the Corporation of the
same class as the Demand Registrable Securities which the Corporation seeks to
have included in such registration (the " _Corporation Registrable
Securities_ "), and (iv) any securities of the Corporation of the same class
as the Demand Registrable Securities proposed to be included in such
registration by holders of registration rights granted other than pursuant to
this Agreement (the " _Other Holder Registrable Securities_ ").

(d) If a Demand Registration pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ involves an
Underwritten Offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters advise the
Corporation, in writing, that in its or their opinion the total number or
dollar amount of Registrable Securities and, if permitted hereunder, other
securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering exceeds the
number of Registrable Securities and other securities, if any, which can be
sold therein without adversely affecting the Corporation or the marketability
of the Underwritten Offering (an " _Adverse Effect_ "), the Corporation may
exclude such number of Registrable Securities as necessary or desirable to
negate such Adverse Effect, in which case it shall include in such
registration: (i) _first_ , subject to the below, all Demand Registrable
Securities and Member Registrable Securities, (ii) _second_ , all Other
Holder Registrable Securities, in each case pro rata based on the amount of
all such Other Holder Registrable Securities requested to be included, and
(iii) _third_ , all Company Registrable Securities. If such managing
underwriter or underwriters advise the Corporation that only a portion of the
Registrable Securities in clause (i) above may be included in such
registration without such Adverse Effect, the Corporation shall include the
Registrable Securities in such clause on a pro rata basis based on the
relative number of Registrable Securities of each Holder requested to be so
included in a registration ( _provided_ that any such amount thereby
allocated to any such Holder that exceeds such Holder's request shall be
reallocated among the remaining requesting Holders in a like manner). Any
Person (other than Holders of Registrable Securities) that participates in
Demand Registrations which are not at the Corporation's expense must pay
their share of any Registration Expenses.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this _Section 2.1_ , in no event
shall the Holder(s) collectively be permitted to (i) request more than one
(1) Demand Registration in any twelve (12)-month period; _provided_ that in
no event shall the Corporation be obligated to file a Registration Statement
relating to any registration request under this _Section 2.1_ within a
period of 180 days after the effective date of any other Registration
Statement relating to any registration request under this _Section 2.1_ or
any other registration effected by the Corporation (other than on Form S-4 or
Form S-8 or any similar or successor form), including under _Section 2.2_ ;
or (ii) request a Demand Registration if, at the time such request is made, a
Shelf Registration or other Registration Statement is effective which
includes all of the Registrable Securities of such Holders and also permits
an Underwritten Offering of such Registrable Securities.

(f) The Corporation shall be entitled to postpone (but not more than once in
any twelve-month period), for a reasonable period of time not in excess of
120 days, the filing of a Registration Statement (including a Shelf
Registration) if the Corporation delivers to the Holders
requesting registration a resolution of the Board that, in the good faith
judgment of the Board, such registration and offering would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect any bona fide material financing of
the Corporation or any material transaction under consideration by the
Corporation (including an acquisition) or would require disclosure of
information that has not been disclosed to the public and is not otherwise
required to be disclosed at that time that would reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the Corporation or a transaction contemplated by
the Corporation. Such Board resolution shall contain a summary statement of
the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the anticipated
delay. The Holders receiving such resolution shall keep the information
contained in such resolution confidential. If the Corporation shall so
postpone the filing of a Registration Statement, the Initiating Holder(s)
shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving
written notice to the Corporation within 20 days of the anticipated
termination date of the postponement period, as provided in such resolution
delivered to the Holders, and in the event of such withdrawal, such request
shall not be counted for purposes of the number of Demand Registrations to
which the Holders are entitled pursuant to the terms herein. In addition, a
Holder of Registrable Securities may not use a Shelf Registration Statement
to effect the sale of any such Registrable Securities unless such Holder has
given the Corporation at least three (3) Business Days advance written notice
of the date or dates of a proposed sale of such securities by such Holder
pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement (which notice may be given as
often as such Holder desires), and upon receipt of such a notice, the
Corporation agrees to provide prompt written notice to such Holder if such
Shelf Registration Statement is not then usable (whether for reasons
described above or otherwise).

  



  

(g) If the Corporation has filed a Shelf Registration Statement and has
included Registrable Securities therein, the Corporation shall be entitled to
suspend (but not more than an aggregate of 120 days in any twelve-month
period), for a reasonable period of time not in excess of 120 days, the offer
or sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration
Statement by any Holder of Registrable Securities if (i) a "road show" is not
then in progress with respect to a proposed offering of Registrable Securities
by such Holder pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement and such Holder
has not executed an underwriting agreement with respect to a pending sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement and (ii)
the Corporation delivers to the Holders included in such Shelf Registration
Statement a resolution of the Board that, in the good faith judgment of the
Board, such offer or sale would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect any bona fide material financing of the Corporation or any
material transaction under consideration by the Corporation (including an
acquisition) or would require disclosure of information that has not been
disclosed to the public and is not otherwise required to be disclosed at that
time that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the
Corporation.

  



  

Such Board resolution shall contain a statement of the reasons for such
postponement and an approximation of the anticipated delay. The Holders
receiving such resolution shall keep the information contained in such
certificate confidential.

(h) The Corporation shall be required to maintain the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement (except in the case of a Shelf Registration) with
respect to any Demand Registration for a period of at least 180 days after
the effective date thereof or such shorter period in which all Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement have actually been sold;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such period shall be extended for a period of
time equal to the period the Holder of Registrable Securities refrains
from selling any securities included in such registration at the request of
(x) an underwriter or (y) the Corporation pursuant to the provisions herein.
The Corporation shall be required to maintain the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement that is a Shelf Registration with respect to any
Demand Registration at all times after the effective date thereof until all
Registrable Securities included in such Shelf Registration Statement have
actually been sold; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Holder of Registrable
Securities whose securities have been included in such Shelf Registration may
request that such Registrable Securities be removed from such Registration
Statement, in which event the Corporation shall promptly either withdraw such
Registration Statement if the Registrable Securities of such Holder are the
only securities still covered by such Registration Statement or file a post-
effective amendment to such Registration Statement removing such Registrable
Securities.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Corporation hereby agrees that (i) each Demand Registration that is a Shelf
Registration shall contain all language (including on the Prospectus cover
sheet, the principal stockholders' table and the plan of distribution) as may
be reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities to allow for a
distribution to, and resale by, the direct and indirect partners, members or
stockholders of a Holder of Registrable Securities (a " _Partner Distribution_
") and (ii) the Corporation shall, at the reasonable request of any Holder of
Registrable Securities seeking to effect a Partner Distribution, file any
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendments and otherwise take any
action reasonably necessary to include such language, if such language was
not included in the initial Registration Statement, or revise such language if
deemed reasonably necessary by such Holder to effect such Partner
Distribution.

  



  

(j) At the election of the Initiating Holder(s), a requested registration
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ may involve an Underwritten Offering and,
in such case, the Initiating Holder(s), in consultation with the Other
Holders, shall have the right to select the investment banker and manager to
administer the offering relating to such Demand Registration, subject to the
approval of the Board, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

  



  

(k) For purposes of this _Section 2.1_ , a registration shall not be counted
as "effected" and shall not be considered a Demand Registration:

  



  

(i) unless a Registration Statement with respect thereto has become effective
and remained effective in compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Act until the earlier of (x) such time as all of the Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition thereof set forth in such
Registration Statement or (y) 180 days after the effective date of such
Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the failure of any
such Registration Statement to become or remain effective in compliance with
this _Section 2.1(k)_ is due solely to acts or omissions of the Initiating
Holder(s), such registration requested pursuant to this _Section 2.1 _will
be deemed to have been effected;

  



  

(ii) if, after it has become effective, the Registration Statement with
respect thereto is subject to any stop order, injunction or other order or
requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or authority prohibiting
the sale of Demand Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement, other than by reason of an act or omission on the part of the
Initiating Holder(s); or

  



  

   

 | -8-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) if, as a result of an exercise of any cutback, a majority of the total
number of Registrable Securities that the Initiating Holder(s) had requested
to be included in such Registration Statement are not included.

  



  

Section 2.2. _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporation proposes to file a registration statement under the
Securities Act (i) with respect to an offering of shares of Capital Stock by
and for the account of the Corporation (other than a registration statement
filed on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any successor forms thereto or filed solely in
connection with an exchange offer, an offering of securities solely to the
Corporation's existing stockholders, an offering of debt securities
convertible into equity securities of the Corporation or any employee stock
options, benefit or dividend reinvestment plan or filed pursuant to _Section
2.1_ hereof), or (ii) pursuant to registration rights of other Persons (a "
_Third Party Holder_ "), then, each such time, the Corporation shall give
prompt written notice of such proposed filing at least 10 days before the
anticipated filing date (the " _Piggyback Notice_ ") to all of the Holders
holding Registrable Securities.

  



  

(b) The Piggyback Notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity to include
in such registration statement the number of Registrable Securities of
the same class as the securities being registered as each such Holder may
request in writing within 5 days after receipt of such Piggyback Notice (a "
_Piggyback Registration_ "). Subject to _Section 2.2(d)_ , the Corporation
shall include in each such Piggyback Registration all Registrable Securities
of the same class as the securities being registered with respect to which
the Corporation has timely received written requests for inclusion therein.
The Holders exercising their rights under _Section 2.2(b)_ shall be
permitted to withdraw all or part of the Registrable Securities from a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effective date of such
Piggyback Registration. The Corporation shall not be required to maintain the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement for a Piggyback Registration
beyond the earlier to occur of (i) 180 days after the effective
date therefore and (ii) the date on which all Registrable Securities included
in such Registration Statement have actually been sold; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Holder of Registrable Securities that has been included
in such Shelf Registration may request that such Registrable Securities be
removed from such Registration Statement, in which event the Corporation shall
promptly either withdraw such Registration Statement if the shares of Common
Stock of such Holder are the only shares of Common Stock still covered by such
Registration Statement or file a post-effective amendment to such
Registration Statement removing such Registrable Securities.

  



  

(c) The Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
managing underwriter of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit Holders of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in the Piggyback Registration
to include all such Registrable Securities on the same terms and conditions
as any other shares of Capital Stock, if any, of the Corporation included
therein.

  



  

   

 | -9-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 2.2(b)_ and _Section 2.2(c)_ , if
registration pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ involves an Underwritten
Offering and if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such Underwritten
Offering have informed the Corporation, in writing, that in its or their view
the total number or dollar amount of shares of Capital Stock that the Holders,
the Corporation and any other Persons having rights to participate in such
registration, intend to include in such offering is such as to have an Adverse
Effect on such offering, then the Corporation may exclude such number of
shares of Capital Stock as necessary or desirable to negate such Adverse
Effect, in which case the number of shares of Capital Stock that in the
opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters can be sold without
adversely affecting such offering shall be included in the following order:

  



  

(i) _first_ , (A) shares of Capital Stock for the account of the Corporation
if the Corporation initiated the filing of the Registration Statement with
respect to an offering for its own account as referenced under _Section
2.2(a)_ or (B) shares of Capital Stock for the account of a Third Party
Holder if such Third Party Holder initiated the filing of the Registration
Statement as referenced under _Section 2.2(a)_ ;

  



  

(ii) _second_ , securities for the account of any Person who has piggyback
registration rights pursuant to agreements of the Corporation in
existence prior to the date hereof, Registrable Securities of Holders and
Preferred Unit Holder Registrable Securities, in each case requested to be
registered, pro rata based on the number of securities so requested to be
included by the holders thereof;

  



  

(iii) _third_ , shares of Capital Stock for the account of the Corporation if
the Corporation did not initiate the filing of the Registration
Statement; and

  



  

(iv) _fourth_ , shares of Capital Stock for the account of any other Persons,
pro rata based on the number of shares of Capital Stock requested to be
included by the holders thereof.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Corporation hereby agrees that (i) any Piggyback Registration that is a Shelf
Registration shall contain all language (including on the Prospectus cover
sheet, the principal stockholders' table and the plan of distribution) as may
be reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities to allow for a
Partner Distribution and (ii) the Corporation shall, at the reasonable
request of any Holder of Registrable Securities seeking to effect a Partner
Distribution, file any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendments and
otherwise take any action reasonably necessary to include such language, if
such language was not included in the initial Registration Statement, or
revise such language if deemed reasonably necessary by such Holder to effect
such Partner Distribution.

  



  

(f) Upon delivering a request under this _Section 2.2_ , a Holder will, if
requested by the Corporation, execute and deliver a custody agreement
and power of attorney in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation with respect to such Holder's Registrable Securities to be
registered pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ (a " _Custody Agreement and Power
of Attorney_ "). The Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney will provide,
among other things, that the Holder will deliver to and deposit in
custody with the custodian and attorney-in-fact named therein a certificate
or certificates representing such Registrable Securities (duly endorsed in
blank by the registered owner or owners thereof or accompanied by duly
executed stock powers in blank) and irrevocably appoint said custodian and
attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to act under the Custody
Agreement and Power of Attorney on such Holder's behalf with respect to the
matters specified therein. Such Holder also agrees to execute such other
agreements as the Corporation may reasonably request to further evidence the
provisions of this _Section 2.2_.

(g) The Corporation shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any
registration initiated by it as referenced under _Section 2.2(a)_.

  



  

Section 2.3. _Form S-3 Registration_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_ , at
such time as the Corporation shall have qualified for the use of Form S-3
promulgated under the Securities Act or any successor form thereto, in case
the Corporation shall receive from any Holder(s) a written request or
requests that the Corporation effect a registration on Form S-3 with respect
to all or a part of the Registrable Securities held by such Holder(s), which
request shall (a) specify the number of Registrable Securities intended to be
sold or disposed of and the holders thereof and (b) the intended method of
distribution, including the name of the lead underwriter, if available, the
Corporation will use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such
registration as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the
sale and distribution of all or such portion of the Registrable Securities as
are specified in such request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Corporation shall not be obligated to effect any such
registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ :

  



  

(i) if the requesting Holder(s) propose(s) to sell Registrable Securities
that would result in aggregate gross proceeds of less than $15,000,000
based on the average closing price of the Common Stock over the 20 trading
days preceding such request pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ ;

  



  

(ii) if within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the Holder(s)
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ , the Corporation gives notice to such
Holder(s) of the Corporation's intention to make a public offering within 90
days, other than pursuant to a Registration Statement relating to any
employee, stock option, benefit or dividend reinvestment plan;

  



  

(iii) if a Shelf Registration or other Registration Statement is then
effective and includes all of the Registrable Securities of such
Holder(s) and permits an Underwritten Offering of such Registrable
Securities;

  



  

(iv) if the Corporation has already effected another registration on Form S-3
on the account of Holders in the immediately preceding 12-month period; or

  



  

(v) in any particular jurisdiction in which the Corporation would be required
to qualify to do business or to execute a general consent to service
of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance.

  



  

(b) To the extent the Corporation is a WKSI at the time that the Shelf
Registration Statement is to be filed, the Corporation shall file an automatic
Shelf Registration Statement which covers such Registrable Securities.

  



  

   

 | -11-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall not be
counted as demands for registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

  



  

(d) The Corporation and Holders shall comply with all other provisions of
_Section 2.1(c)_ , _Section 2.1(d)_ , _Section 2.1(f)_ , _Section 2.1(g)_ ,
_Section 2.1(h)_ and _Section 2.1(i)_ with respect to a registration under
this _Section 2.3_.

  



  

Section 2.4. _Holdback Agreements; Notice Requirements_. Each Holder agrees
that if requested in writing in connection with an Underwritten Offering made
pursuant to a Registration Statement for which such Holder has registration
rights pursuant to this _Article II_ by the managing underwriter or
underwriters of such Underwritten Offering, such Holder will not effect any
public sale or distribution, including any sale pursuant to Rule 144, of any
of the securities being registered or any securities convertible or
exchangeable or exercisable for such securities (except as part of such
Underwritten Offering) or give any Demand Notice during the period beginning
30 days prior to, and ending 90 days after, the effective date of any such
underwritten registration, except as part of any such
underwritten registration (or for such shorter period as to which the
managing underwriter or underwriters may agree, provided that such
shorter period or longer period as required by applicable Law applies equally
to all Holders).

  



  

Section 2.5. _Registration Procedures_. If and whenever the Corporation is
required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the
Securities Act as provided in this Agreement, the Corporation shall use its
reasonable best efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods
of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Corporation shall cooperate
in the sale of the securities and shall, as expeditiously as possible:

  



  

(a) Prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on any form which
shall be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the
Holders thereof or the Corporation in accordance with the intended method or
methods of distribution thereof (including a Partner Distribution), and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to
become effective and to remain effective as provided herein; _provided_
that no later than 5 days before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus
or any amendments or supplements thereto (including documents that would be
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), the
Corporation shall furnish or otherwise make available to the Holders of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement, their counsel
and the managing underwriters, if any, copies of all such documents proposed
to be filed, which documents shall be subject to the review and comments of
such Holders, counsel and managing underwriters. With respect to a Demand
Registration that covers the Registrable Securities of a Holder, such Holder
and its counsel shall have the opportunity to object to any
information pertaining to such Holder that is contained in such Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (including
such documents that, upon filing, would be incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference therein) before it is filed with the SEC, and the
Corporation will make the corrections reasonably requested by such Holder
prior to such filing with the SEC.

  



  

   

 | -12-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective
amendments to each Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such
Registration Statement continuously effective during the period provided
herein and comply in all material respects with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered
by such Registration Statement; and cause the related Prospectus to be
supplemented by any Prospectus supplement as may be necessary to comply with
the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, and as so supplemented to
be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) under
the Securities Act; _provided_ that any Holder of Registrable Securities
that has been included on a Shelf Registration may request that such Holder's
Registrable Securities be removed from such Registration Statement, in which
event the Corporation shall promptly either withdraw such Registration
Statement or file a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement
removing such Registrable Securities.

  



  

(c) Notify each selling Holder of Registrable Securities, its counsel and the
managing underwriters, if any, promptly, and (if requested by any such
Person) confirm such notice in writing:

  



  

(i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective;

  



  

(ii) of any notice from the SEC that there will be a review of a Registration
Statement and, to the extent requested by a Holder, promptly provide such
Holders, their counsel and the managing underwriters, if any, with a copy of
any SEC comments received by the Corporation in connection therewith;

  



  

(iii) of any request by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental
authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or
related Prospectus or for additional information;

  



  

(iv) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings
for that purpose;

  



  

(v) if at any time the representations and warranties of the Corporation
contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement)
contemplated by _Section 2.5(o)_ cease to be true and correct;

  



  

(vi) of the receipt by the Corporation of any notification with respect to
the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of
the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and

  



  

(vii) of the happening of any event that makes any statement made in such
Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material
respect or that requires the making of any changes in such Registration
Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of the Registration
Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

   

 | -13-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the
lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from
qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction.

  



  

(e) If requested by the managing underwriters, if any, or any Holder of
Registrable Securities being sold in connection with an Underwritten
Offering, promptly include in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment such information as the managing underwriters, if any, and such
Holders may reasonably request in order to permit the intended method of
distribution of such securities and make all required filings of such
Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable
after the Corporation has received such request.

  



  

(f) Furnish or make available to each selling Holder of Registrable
Securities, its counsel and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge,
at least five conformed copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus
and Prospectus supplements, if applicable, and each post-effective amendment
thereto, including financial statements (but excluding schedules, all
documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and
all exhibits, unless requested by such Holder, counsel or underwriter).

  



  

(g) Deliver to each selling Holder of Registrable Securities, its counsel and
the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus
or Prospectuses (including each form of Prospectus) and each amendment or
supplement thereto as such Persons may reasonably request in connection with
the distribution of the Registrable Securities; and the Corporation, subject
to the last paragraph of this _Section 2.5_ , hereby consents to the use of
such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the
selling Holders of Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, in
connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered
by such Prospectus and any such amendment or supplement thereto.

  



  

(h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the
selling Holders of Registrable Securities, the underwriters, if any, and
their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification
(or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable
Securities for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions within the United States as any seller or underwriter
reasonably requests and to keep each such registration or qualification (or
exemption therefrom) effective during the period such Registration Statement
is required to be kept effective and to take any other action that may be
necessary or advisable to enable such Holders of Registrable Securities to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdiction; _provided_ that the Corporation will not be required to (i)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so
qualified or (ii) take any action that would subject it to general service of
process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.

certificates (not bearing any legends) representing Registrable Securities to
be sold after receiving written representations from each Holder of such
Registrable Securities that the Registrable Securities represented by the
certificates so delivered by such Holder will be transferred in accordance
with the Registration Statement, and enable such Registrable Securities to be
in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing

in all reasonable respects with the filing of such Registration Statement and
the granting of such approvals, as may be necessary to enable the seller
or sellers thereof or the underwriters, if any, to consummate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities.

  



  

(k) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by _Section 2.5(c)(vii)_ ,
prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any
document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or
file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, such
Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

(i) make such representations and warranties to the Holders of such

other matters as may be reasonably requested by such Holders, counsel and

such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type
customarily covered in comfort letters in connection with Underwritten

selling Holders of the Registrable Securities;

  



  

(iv) if an underwriting agreement is entered into, the same shall contain
indemnification provisions and procedures substantially to the effect set
forth in _Section 2.7_ with respect to all parties to be indemnified
pursuant to _Section 2.7_ ; and

  



  

(v) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by
any Holder of Registrable Securities being sold, such Holder's counsel and
the managing underwriters, if any, to evidence the continued validity of the
representations and warranties made pursuant to _Section 2.5(o)(i)_ and to
evidence compliance with the conditions contained in the underwriting
agreement or other agreement entered into by the Corporation. The above shall

the Corporation and its subsidiaries, and cause the officers, directors and
employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to supply all information
in each case reasonably requested by any such Holder, underwriter, attorney or
accountant in connection with such Registration Statement; _provided_ that
if (1) the Corporation believes after consultation with counsel for the
Corporation, that to do so would cause the Corporation to forfeit an attorney-
client privilege that was applicable to such information or (2) either (x)
the Corporation has requested and been granted from the SEC confidential
treatment of such information contained in any filing with the SEC or
documents provided supplementally or otherwise or (y) the Corporation
reasonably determines in good faith that such records are confidential and so
notifies the Persons requesting the records in writing, the Corporation shall
not be required to provide such information unless prior to furnishing any
such information with respect to (1) or (2) such Person requesting the
records in writing agrees to enter into a confidentiality agreement in
customary form and subject to customary exceptions; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any information that is not publicly available at the time
of delivery of such information shall be kept confidential by such Persons

(i) disclosure of such records is necessary to avoid or correct a
misstatement or omission in the Registration Statement;

  



  

(ii) disclosure of such information is required by court or administrative
order or other legal process;

a result of a disclosure or failure to safeguard by such Person.

  



  

In the case of a proposed disclosure pursuant to (ii) or (iii) above, such
Person shall be required to give the Corporation written notice of the
proposed disclosure prior to such disclosure and, if requested by the
Corporation, assist the Corporation in seeking to prevent or limit the
proposed disclosure.

  



  

(q) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and make
available to its security holders earning statements satisfying the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder, or any
similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act, no later than 45 days
after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month
period if such period is a fiscal year) (i) commencing at the end of any
fiscal quarter in which Registrable Securities are sold to underwriters in a
firm commitment or best efforts Underwritten Offering and (ii) if not sold to
underwriters in such an offering, commencing on the first day of the
first fiscal quarter of the Corporation after the effective date of a
Registration Statement, which statements shall cover one of said 12-month
periods.

diligence sessions in connection with any offering and to participate in
customary "road show" presentations in connection with any Underwritten
Offerings.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Corporation
hereby agrees that any Demand Registration that is a Shelf Registration
shall contain all language (including on the Prospectus cover sheet, the
principal stockholders' table and the plan of distribution) as may be
reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities.

  



  

Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees if such Holder has Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement that, upon receipt of any
notice from the Corporation of the happening of any event of the kind
described in _Section 2.5(c)(iii)_ , _Section 2.5(c)(iv)_ ,
_Section 2.5(c)(v)_ , _Section 2.5(c)(vi)_ or _Section 2.5(c)(vii)_ , such
Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement or Prospectus until such Holder is
advised in writing by the Corporation that the disposition may be resumed
and, if applicable, has received copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by _Section 2.5(k)_ , together with any additional
or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference in such Prospectus; _provided_ that the Corporation shall extend
the time periods under _Section 2.1_ with respect to the length of time
that the effectiveness of a Registration Statement must be maintained by the
amount of time the Holder is required to discontinue disposition of such
securities.

Section 2.7. _Indemnification._

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by the Corporation_. The Corporation shall, without
limitation as to time, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, each Holder whose Registrable Securities are covered by a
Registration Statement or Prospectus, the affiliates, officers, directors,
partners, members, managers, stockholders, accountants, attorneys, agents and
employees of each of them, each Person who controls each such Holder (within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act) and the officers, directors, partners, members, managers, stockholders,
accountants, attorneys, agents and employees of each such controlling person
(collectively, the " _Stockholder Indemnified Persons_ "), from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including reasonable
out-of-pocket costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees of one firm
of counsel for all Stockholder Indemnified Persons and any legal or other
reasonable out-of-pocket fees or expenses incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding), expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties, charges and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_
"), as incurred, arising out of or based upon:

  



  

(i) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any Prospectus, offering circular or other document
(including any related Registration Statement, "issuer free writing
Prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act), "issuer
information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the
Securities Act, notification or the like) incident to any such registration,
qualification, or compliance; or

  



  

   

 | -19-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or, with respect to any Prospectus, necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

  



  

 _provided_ that the Corporation will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based on any untrue statement
(or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) by such
Holder or underwriter, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such
Registration Statement, Prospectus, offering circular or other document
(including any related Registration Statement, "issuer free writing
Prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act), "issuer
information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under
the Securities Act, notification or the like) in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Corporation by such
Holder or underwriter specifically for use in connection with the preparation
of such Registration Statement, Prospectus, offering circular, or other
document (including any related Registration Statement, "issuer free writing
Prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act), "issuer
information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the
Securities Act, notification or the like).

  



  

It is agreed that the indemnity agreement contained in this _Section 2.7(a)_
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such Loss if
such settlement is effected without the consent of the Corporation (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Corporation also agrees to
indemnify any underwriter of Registrable Securities and each Person who
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act) such underwriter, on substantially the same basis as
that provided to the Stockholder Indemnified Persons in this _Section
2.7(a)_.

  



  

(b) _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. In connection
with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of Registrable
Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Corporation in
writing such information as the Corporation reasonably requests for use in
connection with any Registration Statement or Prospectus and agrees to
indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, severally and not jointly,
the Corporation, its directors, officers, managers, accountants, attorneys,
agents and employees, each Person who controls the Corporation (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the
Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, partners, members, managers,
stockholders, accountants, attorneys, agents or employees of such controlling
persons (collectively, the " _Corporation Indemnified Persons_ "), from and
against all Losses arising out of or based upon: (i) any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any Prospectus,
offering circular or other document (including any related Registration
Statement, "issuer free writing Prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the
Securities Act), "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant
to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, notification or the like) incident
to any such registration, qualification, or compliance; or (ii) any
omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
or, with respect to any Prospectus, necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
will reimburse each such Corporation Indemnified Person for any legal and any
other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending any such Loss, in each case to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such untrue statement or omission is made in such Registration
Statement, Prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Corporation by
such Holder specifically for use in connection with the preparation of such
Registration Statement, Prospectus, offering circular or other document
(including any related Registration Statement, "issuer free writing
Prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act), "issuer
information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the
Securities Act, notification or the like); _provided_ that the obligations
of such Holder hereunder shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any
such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) if such settlement is effected
without the consent of such Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the liability of each selling
Holder of Registrable Securities hereunder shall be limited to the net
proceeds received by such selling Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement. Each such
Holder also agrees to indemnify any underwriter of Registrable Securities and
each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such underwriter, on substantially
the same basis as that provided to the Corporation Indemnified Persons in this
_Section 2.7(b)_.

  



  

   

 | -20-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_.

  



  

(i) If any Person shall be entitled to indemnity under this _Section 2.7_
(an " _indemnified party_ "), such indemnified party shall give prompt notice
to the party from which such indemnity is sought (the " _indemnifying party_
") of any claim or of the commencement of any proceeding with respect to
which such indemnified party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant
hereto; _provided_ that the delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any obligation or
liability except to the extent that the indemnifying party has been prejudiced
by such delay or failure.

  



  

(ii) The indemnifying party shall have the right, exercisable by giving
written notice to an indemnified party promptly after the receipt of
written notice from such indemnified party of such claim or proceeding, to,
unless in the indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest
between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such
claim, assume, at the indemnifying party's expense, the defense of any such
claim or proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party; _provided_ that an indemnified party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such claim or proceeding and to participate in
the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
the expense of such indemnified party unless:

  



  

(A) the indemnifying party agrees to pay such fees and expenses;

  



  

(B) the indemnifying party fails promptly to assume, or in the event of a
conflict of interest cannot assume, the defense of such claim or
proceeding (in which case the indemnified party shall have the right to
employ counsel and to assume the defense of such claim or proceeding);

  



  

   

 | -21-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(C) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified
party which are additional to or conflict with those available to the
indemnifying party; or

  



  

(D) the named parties to any such claim or proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them
(which may include that the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded
that there may be one or more legal or equitable defense available to such
indemnified party which conflict with those available to the indemnifying
party); _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not, in
connection with any one such claim or proceeding or separate but substantially
similar or related claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising
out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one firm of attorneys (together with appropriate
local counsel) at any time for all of the indemnified parties, or for fees
and expenses that are not reasonable;

  



  

in each of which cases, the indemnifying party shall only be responsible for
the reasonable fees and expenses of one firm of legal counsel for the
indemnified party.

  



  

(iii) Whether or not such defense is assumed by the indemnifying party, such
indemnified party will not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made without its consent (but such consent will not be
unreasonably withheld) unless the settlement includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect of such
claim or litigation for which such indemnified party would be entitled to
indemnification hereunder. The indemnifying party shall not consent to entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party, from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation for which such indemnified party would be entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(d) _Contribution_.

  



  

(i) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 2.7_ is
unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any Losses (other than
in accordance with its terms), then each applicable indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other
hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted
in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and indemnified
party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such
indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any
such action, statement or omission.

  



  

   

 | -22-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section 2.7(d)_ were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 2.7(d)_ , an
indemnifying party that is a selling Holder of Registrable Securities
shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the net proceeds from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold by
such indemnifying party exceeds the amount of any damages that such
indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

  



  

(iv) No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



  

(v) The obligation of each selling Holder of Registrable Securities to
contribute pursuant to this _Section 2.7(d)_ is several, and not joint, in
proportion to the net proceeds of the offering received by such selling Holder
in relation to the total net proceeds of the offering received by all of the
selling Holders.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on
indemnification and contribution contained in any underwriting agreement
entered into in connection with any underwritten public offering are in
conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the
underwriting agreement shall control.

  



  

Section 2.8. _Participation in Public Offering_. No Holder may participate in
any registration of Public Offering hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to
sell such Holder's securities on the basis provided in any underwriting
arrangements approved by the Holders entitled hereunder to approve such
arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably
required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and the provisions
of this Agreement in respect of registration rights.

  



  

Section 2.9. _Other Indemnification_. Indemnification similar to that
specified herein (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the
Corporation and the registering Holder participating therein with respect to
any required registration or other qualification of securities under any
federal or state law or regulation or Governmental Authority other than the
Securities Act.

  



  

   

 | -23-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.10. _Rule 144_. At all times after the Corporation has filed a
Registration Statement with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of either the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the Corporation will timely file all
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, and
will take such further action as any Holder of Registrable Securities may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time, to enable
such Holder to sell, without registration, Registrable Securities pursuant to
Rule 144 or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC,
including furnishing to any Holder of Registrable Securities, so long as such
Holder owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request:

  



  

(a) a written statement by the Corporation that it has complied with the
reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act
(at any time after the Corporation has become subject to such reporting
requirements), or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be
resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after the Corporation so qualifies);

  



  

(b) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Corporation
and such other reports and documents so filed by the Corporation; and

  



  

(c) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any
such Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of
any such securities without registration (at any time after the Corporation
has become subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act) or
pursuant to such Form S-3 (at any time after the Corporation so qualifies to
use such form).

  



  

Section 2.11. _Parties in Interest_. Each Holder shall be entitled to receive
the benefits of this Agreement and shall be bound by the terms and provisions
of this Agreement by reason of such Holder's election to participate in a
registration under this _Article II_. To the extent Class B Units are
effectively transferred in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement, the
Permitted Transferee of such Class B Units shall be entitled to receive the
benefits of this Agreement and shall be bound by the terms and provisions of
this Agreement upon becoming bound hereby pursuant to _Section 3.10_.

  



  

Article III 
 MISCELLANEOUS

required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and either

jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of
this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any party or

EXHIBIT L

  



  

TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS Tax Receivable Agreement (" _TRA_ ") is made and entered into as of [●],
2017 (the " _Effective Date_ ") by and among Sequel Youth and Family
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Sequel CS, Inc.,
an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of Sequel Camelot Parent, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company that is wholly owned by the Company ("
_Camelot_ "), the holders of Class B units in Sequel Youth and Family
Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ ")
listed on Schedule 1 (the " _Class B Unitholders_ "), The Ripley Revocable
Trust (" _Ripley_ ") and John F. Ripley in his capacity as the representative
of the Class B Unitholders and who is referred to herein from time to time as
the " _TRA Representative_." Ripley and the Class B Unitholders are jointly
known as " _Minority Members_ ," and each a Minority Member.

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

1. Prior to the Effective Date of this TRA and the Closing Arrangements,
defined below, the equity in Company was owned by Parent, Camelot, the Class
B Unit Holders, Ripley, and Alaris USA Inc. (the " _Preferred Holder_ ").

  



  

2. Also prior to the Effective Date of this TRA, (i) Sequel Acquisition, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent,
will have merged with and into the Company in accordance with the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated January 11, 2017 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), and
the parties will have received the consideration as set forth in the Merger
Agreement; (ii) the Preferred Holder will have received a distribution from
the Company of Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000.00); and (iii) pursuant to
the covenant in the Merger Agreement, the Class B Unitholders and Ripley will
have received (a) a cash distribution, (b) rights under an agreement relating
to the exchange of interests in the Company into stock of Parent dated as of
the date hereof (the " _Exchange Agreement_ "), (c) warrants (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) to acquire the stock of Parent and (d) the rights under
this TRA. Steps (i) - (iii) are defined as the " _Closing Arrangements_."

  



  

3. At the Effective Date, after the completion of the Merger and the Closing
Arrangements, Parent, Camelot, the Preferred Holder, Ripley and the Class B
Unitholders will hold the units of the Company (the Company's units generally
referred to as " _Units_ " herein) outstanding as shown on Exhibit C, and
will be parties to the Seventh Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of
the Company (the " _LLC Agreement_ ").

  



  

4. The parties intend to treat the merger and the Closing Arrangements as
integrated transactions, such that the Surviving Entity, as defined in the
Merger Agreement, is a continuation of the Company for United States federal
income tax purposes, and Parent is treated as having acquired by purchase
(79.3%) of the then outstanding common Units of the Company on a fully diluted
basis as a result of the merger and the Closing Arrangements, for the
consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement and in the
Closing Arrangements.

  



  

5. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Minority Members may exchange
their Class B Units for shares of common stock of Parent (" _Common Shares_
") and the right to certain payments under this TRA.

  



  

   



 



    



  

6. The Company and each of its direct and (to the extent owned through a
chain of pass-through entities) indirect subsidiaries (if any) which is
treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes (the
Company, such subsidiaries, and any direct or (to the extent owned through a
chain of pass-through entities) indirect subsidiary that is disregarded as an
entity separate from its owner, together, " _Company Group_ "), have, or will
have, in effect an election under Section 754 of the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), for each Taxable Year
(as such term is defined below) in which an Exchange (as such term is defined
below) occurs, which election is intended to result in an adjustment to the
tax basis of the assets owned by the Company Group (solely with respect to
Parent and Camelot) at the time of an Exchange (such time, the " _Exchange
Date_ ").

  



  

7. The income, gain, loss, deduction and other Tax (as such term is defined
below) items of Parent Consolidated Group may be affected by (i) the Basis
Adjustments (as such term is defined below) and (ii) the Imputed Interest (as
such term is defined below).

  



  

8. The parties to this Agreement desire to make certain arrangements with
respect to the effect of the Basis Adjustments and Imputed Interest on the
liability for Taxes of Parent and certain other matters.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

Article 1 
 DEFINITIONS

  



  

Section 1.1. _Definitions_. As used in this TRA, the terms set forth in this
Article 1 shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined).

  



  

" _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that
directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, Controls, is
Controlled by, or is under common Control with, such first Person.

  



  

" _Amended Schedule_ " is defined in Section 2.4(b).

  



  

" _Basis Adjustment_ " means the adjustment to the tax basis of a Reference
Asset, whether as reported on a Tax Return or as a result of a
Determination, under sections 732, 743(b) or 1012 of the Code, as applicable,
and any other similar or successor provisions of the Code (both in situations
where, as a result of one or more Exchanges, Company becomes an entity that is
disregarded as separate from its owner for tax purposes and in situations
where, following an Exchange, Company remains in existence as an entity for
United States federal income tax purposes) and, in each case, comparable
sections of foreign, state and local income and franchise tax laws, arising
by reason of the Closing Arrangements, the Exchange Agreement (or any Exchange
thereunder) and all payments under this TRA, and that arise solely with
respect to Units held by the Minority Members. For purposes of calculating the
Basis Adjustment with respect to the Minority Members, the transferee's share
of partnership property will be determined in accordance with section 743(b)
and regulations promulgated thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties intend that as of the Closing Date all gain recognized on a
hypothetical sale of Company would be allocated solely to the Minority Members
with no portion of such hypothetical gain allocated to the Preferred Member,
such that no Basis Adjustment arises from any transactions related to
the Units held by the Preferred Holder. The amount of any Basis Adjustment
resulting from an Exchange of one or more Units shall be determined without
regard to any Pre-Exchange Transfer of such Units and as if any such Pre-
Exchange Transfer had not occurred.

consummation of any transaction or series of integrated transactions
immediately following which (A) the record holders of the shares of Capital

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the application of the Valuation
Assumptions when provided for in this TRA) over (b) the Hypothetical Tax
Liability determined with reference to such Minority Member in respect of the
Taxable Year. If all or a portion of the actual tax liability of Parent for
the Taxable Year arises as a result of an audit by a Taxing Authority of any
Taxable Year, such liability shall not be included in determining the Realized
Tax Benefit unless and until there has been a Determination.

Article 2 
 DETERMINATION OF CERTAIN REALIZED TAX BENEFITS

  



  

Section 2.1. _Basis Adjustment_. The parties hereto acknowledge that an
Exchange constitutes a transfer of an interest in Company giving rise to a
Basis Adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, payments made under this TRA
shall not be treated as resulting in a Basis Adjustment to the extent such
payments are treated as Imputed Interest.

  



  

Section 2.2. _Basis Schedule_. Within forty-five (45) calendar days after the
filing of the United States federal income tax return of Parent for each
Taxable Year in which any Exchange has been effected, Parent shall deliver to
the TRA Representative (on behalf of each Minority Member) a schedule (the "
_Exchange Basis Schedule_ ") that shows, in reasonable detail necessary to
perform the calculations required by this TRA, including with respect to each
Minority Member, for purposes of Taxes, (i) the Non-Stepped Up Tax Basis of
the Reference Assets as of the Exchange Date, (ii) the Basis Adjustments with
respect to the Reference Assets as a result of any Exchanges effected in the
Closing Arrangements, any other Exchanges effected in such Taxable Year
and Exchanges effected in prior Taxable Years, calculated in the aggregate
and identified separately based on whether the Basis Adjustment arises by
virtue of an Exchange effected in the Closing Arrangements, the current
Taxable Year or prior Taxable Years, (iii) the period (or periods) over which
the Reference Assets are amortizable and/or depreciable and (iv) the period
(or periods) over which each Basis Adjustment is amortizable and or
depreciable, identified separately based on whether the Basis Adjustment
arises by virtue of an Exchange effected in the Closing Arrangements, the
current Taxable Year or prior Taxable Years. The Exchange Basis Schedule will
become final as provided in Section 2.4(a) and may be amended as provided in
Section 2.4(b) (subject to the procedures set forth in Section 2.4(b)).

  



  

Section 2.3. _Tax Benefit Schedule_.

  



  

(a)  _Tax Benefit Schedule_. Within sixty (60) calendar days after the filing
of the United States federal income tax return of Parent for any Taxable Year
in which there is a Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment, Parent
shall provide to the TRA Representative (on behalf of each Minority Member) a
schedule showing, in reasonable detail and, at the request of the TRA
Representative, with respect to each separate Exchange by a Minority Member,
the calculation of the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment with
respect to an Exchange effected in the Closing Arrangements, for any Exchange
effected in a prior Taxable Year and for any Exchange effected for such
Taxable Year with respect to such Minority Member (each a " _Tax Benefit
Schedule_ "). The Tax Benefit Schedule will become final as provided in
Section 2.4(a) and may be amended as provided in Section 2.4(b) (subject to
the procedures set forth in Section 2.4(b)).

  



  

   

 | -10-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  _Applicable Principles_. Subject to Sections 3.3 and 3.4, the Realized
Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for each Taxable Year is intended to
measure the decrease or increase in the actual cash liability for Taxes of
Parent (on a consolidated basis, as relevant) for such Taxable Year
attributable to the Basis Adjustments and Imputed Interest, determined using a
"with and without" methodology. In preparing the Tax Returns upon which the
Realized Tax Benefit or Detriment are prepared, and in calculating the
Hypothetical Tax Liability, Parent will not take any positions that are not
more likely than not to be sustained if challenged by a Tax authority. For
the avoidance of doubt, the actual liability for Taxes will take into account
the deduction of the portion of each Tax Benefit Payment that must be
accounted for as interest under the Code based upon the characterization of
Tax Benefit Payments as additional consideration payable by Parent for the
Units acquired in an Exchange, and any tax items of any member of the
consolidated tax return of Parent, including, for example, net operating
losses of Camelot that are deductible in a year after the Closing Date.
Carryovers or carrybacks of any Tax item attributable to the Basis Adjustment
and Imputed Interest shall be considered to be subject to the rules of Code
and the Treasury Regulation or the appropriate provisions of foreign,
state and local income and franchise tax law, as applicable, governing the
use, limitation, and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant-
type. If a carryover or carryback of any Tax item includes a portion that is
attributable to the Basis Adjustment or Imputed Interest and another portion
that is not, such portions shall be considered to be used in accordance with
the "with and without" methodology, recognizing that the Hypothetical Tax
Liability for the year would not include any such carryover or carryback, but
such amount would be taken into account in calculating the Realized Tax
Benefit for the year, if it is actually utilized in such year. For the
avoidance of doubt, if there is a carryover or carryback of any Tax item that
is not attributable to the Basis Adjustment or Imputed Interest, it will be
utilized in the calculation of the Hypothetical Tax Liability and
the Realized Tax Benefit and Realized Tax Detriments for the year to which it
is carried, to the extent possible. The parties agree that (1) all Tax
Benefit Payments (other than amounts accounted for as interest under the Code)
will (A) be treated as subsequent upward purchase price adjustments that give
rise to further Basis Adjustments to Reference Assets for Parent and (B) have
the effect of creating additional Basis Adjustments to Reference Assets for
Parent in the year of payment, and (2) as a result, such additional Basis
Adjustments will be incorporated into the current year calculation and into
future year calculations, as appropriate.

  



  

Section 2.4. _Procedures, Amendments_.

  



  

(a)  _Procedure_. Every time Parent delivers to the TRA Representative or a
Minority Member an applicable Schedule under this TRA, including any Amended
Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(b), but excluding any Early
Termination Schedule, Change of Control Termination Schedule, amended Early
Termination Schedule or amended Change of Control Termination Schedule,
Parent shall also (i) deliver to the TRA Representative (on behalf of each
Minority Member) schedules and work papers, as reasonably determined by
Parent or reasonably requested by the TRA Representative, providing reasonable
detail regarding the preparation of the Schedule and (ii) allow the TRA
Representative reasonable access at no cost to the appropriate representatives
at Parent, as determined by Parent or requested by the TRA Representative in
connection with a review of such Schedule. An applicable Schedule or
amendment thereto shall become final and binding on Parent and a Minority
Member thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on which the TRA
Representative received the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto unless
the TRA Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving
an applicable Schedule or amendment thereto, provides Parent with notice of a
material objection to such Schedule (" _Objection Notice_ ") made in good
faith or (ii) provides a written waiver of such right of any Objection Notice
within the period described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule
or amendment thereto becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by
Parent. If the parties, for any reason, are unable to successfully
resolve the issues raised in the Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar
days after receipt by Parent of an Objection Notice, Parent and the TRA
Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures as described in
Section 7.9 (the " _Reconciliation Procedures_ ").

  



  

   

 | -11-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  _Amended Schedule_. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year shall
be amended from time to time by Parent (i) in connection with a Determination
affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct inaccuracies in the Schedule
identified as a result of the receipt of additional factual information
relating to any Taxable Year after the date the Schedule was provided to the
TRA Representative, (iii) to comply with the Expert's determination under the
Reconciliation Procedures, (iv) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax
Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to a
carryback or carryforward of a loss or other Tax item to such Taxable Year,
(v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment
for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such
Taxable Year or (vi) to adjust an Exchange Basis Schedule to take into
account payments made pursuant to this TRA (any such Schedule an " _Amended
Schedule_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, no Minority Member shall have any
obligation to make any payment to Parent, or to reimburse Parent, for amounts
previously paid pursuant to this TRA.

  



  

Article 3 
 TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS

  



  

Section 3.1. _Payments_.

  



  

(a)  _Payments_. Within five (5) Business Days after a Tax Benefit Schedule
or Amended Schedule delivered to TRA Representative (on behalf of the
Minority Members) becomes final in accordance with Section 2.4, Parent shall
pay to each Minority Member for the applicable Taxable Year the Tax Benefit
Payment with respect to such Minority Member for such Taxable Year, as
determined pursuant to Section 3.l(b). Each such Tax Benefit Payment shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account
previously designated by the Minority Member to Parent or as otherwise agreed
by Parent and the Minority Member. For the avoidance of doubt, no Tax Benefit
Payment shall be made in respect of estimated tax payments, including, without
limitation, United States federal estimated income tax payments.

  



  

(b) A " _Tax Benefit Payment_ " for a Taxable Year means, with respect to
each Minority Member, an amount, not less than zero, equal to the sum of the
Minority Member's Net Tax Benefit. Subject to Sections 3.3 and 3.4, the "
_Net Tax Benefit_ " with respect to each Class B Unitholder (other than
Ripley) for a Taxable Year shall be an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
eighty percent (80%) of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit with respect
to such Class B Unitholder for such Taxable Year over the total amount of
payments previously made to such Class B Unitholder under this Section 3.1
(excluding payments attributable to Imputed Interest). Subject to Sections
3.3 and 3.4, the " _Net Tax Benefit_ " with respect to Ripley for a Taxable
Year shall be the excess, if any, of eighty percent (80%) of the Ripley
Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit for such Taxable Year over the sum of (i)
the Exception Amount, and (ii) the total amount of payments previously made to
such Ripley under this Section 3.1 (excluding payments attributable to
Imputed Interest). For avoidance of doubt, Schedule 1 attached hereto sets
forth the calculation of the Net Tax Benefit with respect to Ripley and the
Net Tax Benefit attributable to Class B Unitholders (other than Ripley) based
upon hypothetical amounts of Basis Adjustments and Realized Tax Benefits.

  



  

   

 | -12-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 3.2. _No Duplicative Payments and Principles_. It is intended that
the provisions of this TRA will not result in duplicative payment of any
amount required under this TRA. It is also intended that the provisions of
this TRA provide that eighty percent (80%) of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax
Benefit with respect each Class B Unitholder (other than Ripley) will be paid
to such Class B Unitholder, and that Ripley will also be paid eighty percent
(80%) of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax benefit attributable to his
Exchanges, but only to the extent that the Ripley Cumulative Net Realized Tax
Benefit exceeds the Exception Amount; Parent retains the first five million
dollars ($5,000,000) of Net Tax Benefit with respect to the Ripley Cumulative
Net Realized Tax Benefit attributable to Ripley's Exchanges. The provisions
shall be construed in the appropriate manner to ensure such intentions are
realized.

  



  

Section 3.3. _Insufficient Taxable Income or Insufficient Funds_.
Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.1(a) or (b) to the contrary, and
subject to Section 3.4 hereof, to the extent that the aggregate tax benefit of
Parent's deduction with respect to the Basis Adjustments or Imputed Interest
under this TRA is limited in a particular Taxable Year because Parent does not
have sufficient taxable income, or to the extent that Parent lacks sufficient
funds to satisfy its obligations to make all Tax Benefit Payments due with
respect to a particular Taxable Year, the limitation on the tax benefit for
Parent, or the payments under this TRA that may be made, as the case may be,
shall be taken into account or made for each Person entitled to receive a
payment pursuant to Section 3.1(a) on a first-in first-out basis by
calculating and paying out Net Tax Benefits in the following order of
priority: (i) first Net Tax Benefits during such Taxable Year (whether by
virtue of current year deductions or carryovers of net operating losses
arising in prior years from Basis Adjustments) arising from Exchanges effected
in the Closing Arrangements (pro rata among the members who Exchanged units
in the Closing Arrangements), and then (ii) Net Tax Benefits during such
Taxable Year (whether by virtue of current year deductions or carryovers of
net operating losses arising in prior years from Basis Adjustments)
arising from Exchanges following the Exchanges effected in the Closing
Arrangements on a first-in first-out basis, with the Net Tax Benefits arising
from Exchanges effected in an earlier Taxable Year calculated and paid out
prior to Net Tax Benefits arising from Exchanges effected in later Taxable
Years (pro rata among members who Exchange in a Taxable Year (but after the
Closing Arrangements), without regard to when the Exchange occurred in the
Taxable Year). For avoidance of doubt, Schedule 2 attached hereto sets forth
the calculation of the ordering of the calculation and payment of such Net
Tax Benefits on a first-in first-out basis based upon hypothetical amounts of
Basis Adjustments and Realized Tax Benefits.

Article 4 
 TERMINATION

  



  

Section 4.1. _Termination and Breach of TRA_.

  



  

(a) With the written approval of the Required Independent Directors, Parent
may terminate this TRA with respect to all amounts payable to the Minority
Members at any time by paying to them the Early Termination Payments in cash;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this TRA shall only terminate under this
Section 4.l(a) effective upon the receipt of the Early Termination Payments by
the Minority Members; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may withdraw
any notice to execute its termination rights under this Section 4.1(a) prior
to the time at which all or any portion of any Early Termination Payment has
been paid. Upon payment in full of the Early Termination Payments by Parent,
Parent shall not have any further payment obligations under this TRA,
other than for any (i) Tax Benefit Payments due and payable but unpaid as of
the Early Termination Notice; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments due for the
Taxable Year ending with or including the date of the Early Termination Notice
(except to the extent that the amount described in clause (ii) is included in
Early Termination Payments). If an Exchange occurs after Parent has made all
Tax Benefit Payments to the Minority Members in full as specified above,
Parent shall have no obligations under this TRA with respect to
such Exchange.For purposes of this Section 4.1, a Minority Member includes a
person who was a Minority Member prior to the receipt of notice from Parent
pursuant to this Section 4.1(a), and who exchanged Class B Units for Parent
Common Stock prior to such notice pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Exchange
Agreement..

  



  

(b) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, Parent shall be obligated to
terminate this TRA effective as of the Change of Control Termination Date by
paying to the Minority Members the Change of Control Termination Payments,
substituting "Change of Control Termination Date" for "Early Termination
Date" each time Early Termination Date appears in the definition of Valuation
Assumptions and substituting "Change of Control Termination Schedule" for
"Early Termination Schedule" each time Early Termination Schedule appears in
the definition of Valuation Assumptions, and following the procedures set
forth in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, as applicable to a Change of Control;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this TRA shall only terminate under this
Section 4.1(b) effective upon the receipt of all of the Change of Control
Termination Payments by the Minority Members. Upon payment in full of the
Change of Control Termination Payments by Parent, Parent shall have no further
payment obligations under this TRA, other than for any (i) Tax Benefit
Payments due and payable but unpaid as of the Change of Control
Termination Notice; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments due for the Taxable Year
ending with or including the date of the Change of Control Termination Notice
(except to the extent that the amount described in clause (ii) is included in
Change of Control Termination Payments). If an Exchange occurs after Parent
has made all Tax Benefit Payments to the Minority Members in full as specified
above, Parent shall have no obligations under this TRA with respect to such
Exchange. For purposes of a Change of Control Termination Payment, a Minority
Member includes a person who was a Minority Member immediately prior to the
Change of Control, who exchanged Class B Units for Parent Common Stock
immediately prior to the Change of Control pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the
Exchange Agreement.

  



  

(c) In the event that Parent breaches any of its material obligations under
this TRA, whether as a result of failure to make any payment within thirty
(30) days of when due, failure to honor any other material obligation required
hereunder or by operation of law as a result of the rejection in a case
commenced under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, then all obligations
hereunder shall be accelerated and such obligations shall be calculated as if
an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such breach and
shall include, but shall not be limited to: (i) Early Termination Payments
calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date
of the breach; (ii) any Tax Benefit Payments due and payable but unpaid as of
the date of the breach; and (iii) any Tax Benefit Payments due for the
Taxable Year ending with or including the date of the breach. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that Parent breaches this TRA, the TRA
Representative (on behalf of any Minority Member) shall be entitled to elect
to receive the amounts set forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above or
to seek specific performance of the terms hereof. The parties agree that the
failure to make any payment due pursuant to this TRA within thirty (30) days
after the date such payment is due shall be deemed to be a breach of a
material obligation under this TRA for all purposes hereof.

  



  

   

 | -14-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 4.2. _Termination Notice_. If Parent chooses to exercise its right of
early termination under Section 4.1 above, or within thirty (30) days of a
Change of Control, Parent shall deliver to each of the Minority Members notice
of such intention to exercise such right or of such occurrence (" _Early
Termination Notice_ " or " _Change of Control Termination Notice_ ," as
applicable) and a schedule (the " _Early Termination Schedule_ " or " _Change
of Control Termination Schedule_ ," as applicable) specifying Parent's
intention to exercise such right, or the presence of such occurrence, and
showing in reasonable detail the calculation of the Early Termination Payments
or the Change of Control Termination Payments, as applicable, for the
Minority Members. Parent shall, along with such notice and schedule, (i)
deliver to the TRA Representative (on behalf of the Minority Members)
schedules and work papers, as reasonably determined by Parent or reasonably
requested by the TRA Representative providing reasonable detail regarding the
preparation of the Schedule and (ii) allow the TRA Representative reasonable
access, at no cost, to the appropriate representatives at Parent, as
reasonably determined by Parent or reasonably requested by the TRA
Representative, in connection with a review of such schedule. The Early
Termination Schedule or Change of Control Termination Schedule, as
applicable, shall become final and binding on Parent and a Minority Member
thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on which the TRA Representative
received such schedule or amendment thereto unless the TRA Representative (i)
within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving such schedule, provides
Parent with notice of a material objection to such schedule made in good
faith (" _Material Objection Notice_ ") or (ii) provides a written waiver of
such right of a Material Objection Notice within the period described in
clause (i) above, in which case such schedule becomes binding on the date the
waiver is received by Parent (the " _Early Termination Effective Date_ " or "
_Change of Control Termination Effective Date_ "). If for any reason the
parties are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by Parent of the Material
Objection Notice, Parent and the TRA Representative shall engage in the
Reconciliation Procedures.

  



  

Section 4.3. _Payment upon Termination_.

  



  

(a) Within three (3) Business Days after the Early Termination Effective
Date, Parent shall pay to each Minority Member an amount equal to the Early
Termination Payment with respect to such Minority Member. On the Change of
Control Termination Effective Date, Parent shall pay to each Minority Member
an amount equal to the Change of Control Termination Payment with respect to
such Minority Member. Such payments shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts designated by each
of the Minority Members or as otherwise agreed by Parent and each of the
Minority Members.

  



  

   

 | -15-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) " _Early Termination Payment_ " for a Minority Member shall equal the
present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of the Early
Termination Effective Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments that would be required
to be paid by Parent to the Minority Member hereunder beginning from the
Early Termination Date and assuming that the Valuation Assumptions are
applied. " _Change of Control Termination Payment_ " for a Minority Member
shall equal the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of
the Change of Control Termination Effective Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments
that would be required to be paid by Parent to the Minority Member hereunder
beginning as of the Change of Control Termination Date and assuming that the
Valuation Assumptions are applied, as amended by Section 4.l(b). The present
value determinations pursuant to this Section 4.3(b) shall be made assuming
the Parent filed its U. S. federal income tax returns on the original due date
(without extension).

  



  

Section 4.4. _Scheduled Termination_. No Tax Benefit Payment shall accrue, or
shall become due or payable with respect to any Exchange after the sixtieth
(60th) anniversary (the "Scheduled Termination Date") of the effective date of
such Exchange. For avoidance of doubt, this TRA shall continue to be in
effect in periods after the Scheduled Termination Date with respect to
Tax Benefit Payments that arise on or before such date, or any adjustment
thereto, and shall terminate upon such time as when all Tax Benefit Payments
due and payable hereunder have been paid and the Determinations have been made
with respect to all such payments.

  



  

Article 5 
 SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS

  



  

Section 5.1. _Subordination_. Notwithstanding any other provision to the
contrary, any payment required to be made by Parent under this TRA shall rank
subordinate and junior in right of payment to any principal, interest or other
amounts due and payable in respect of any obligations in respect of
indebtedness for borrowed money of Parent and its Subsidiaries from unrelated
lenders (" _Senior Obligations_ ") and shall rank pari passu with all current
or future unsecured obligations of Parent that are not Senior Obligations.
For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that a payment is subordinated pursuant
to this Section 5.1 and thus cannot be made, does not mean that a failure to
make a payment in a timely manner under Section 4.1(c) is not a
material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.2. _Late Payments by Parent_. The amount of all or any portion of
any payment not made by Parent when due under the terms of this TRA shall be
payable together with any interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate and
commencing from the date on which such payment was due. For avoidance of
doubt, this Section 5.2 shall not limit or restrict in any way the rights of
the Minority Members hereunder, including, without limitation, their rights
under Section 4.1(c) hereof.

  



  

Article 6 
 NO DISPUTES; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION

  



  

Section 6.1. _Election to be Filed_. As the sole managing member of Company,
Parent shall cause Company and each Company Group member that is treated as a
partnership for United States federal income tax purposes to file an election
under Section 754 of the Code (a " _754 Election_ ") commencing no later than
with its first Taxable Year which includes an Exchange, unless such entity
already has a 754 Election in effect, and shall not cause any such entity to
revoke such election until this TRA is no longer in effect for any Minority
Member. If Company acquires an interest in an entity that is treated as a
partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, either directly or
indirectly through one or more entities treated as a partnership or
disregarded entity for United States federal income tax purposes, Parent shall
use its best efforts to cause such entity to file a 754 Election effective
for each such entity's Taxable Year in which such acquisition occurs, unless
such entity already has a 754 Election in effect, and shall not cause such
entity to revoke such election until this TRA is no longer in effect.

Section 6.2. _Participation in Parent 's and Company's Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, Parent shall have full
responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all Tax matters
concerning Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing. Parent shall notify the TRA
Representative (on behalf of the Minority Members) of, and keep the TRA
Representative (on behalf of the Minority Members) reasonably informed with
respect to, the portion of any audit of Parent by a Taxing Authority the
outcome of which is reasonably expected to materially affect the rights and
obligations of such Minority Member under this TRA, and shall provide to the
TRA Representative reasonable opportunity to provide information and other
input to Parent and its advisors concerning the conduct of any such portion of
such audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to
take any action that is inconsistent with any provision of the LLC Agreement.

  



  

(b) The rights and responsibilities of Parent and the Minority Members with
respect to Tax matters concerning Company and its Subsidiaries shall be as
set forth in the LLC Agreement or, as applicable, the Merger Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.3. _Consistency_. Parent and the Minority Members agree to report
and cause to be reported for all purposes, including federal, foreign, state
and local Tax purposes and financial reporting purposes, all Tax-related items
(including, without limitation, the Basis Adjustments and each Tax Benefit
Payment) in a manner consistent with that specified by Parent in any Schedule
required to be provided by or on behalf of Parent under this TRA, provided
Parent prepares and finalizes each such Schedule in accordance with the terms
hereof, unless otherwise required by a Determination.

  



  

Section 6.4. _Cooperation_. Each applicable Minority Member shall (a) furnish
to Parent in a timely manner such information, documents and other materials
as Parent may reasonably request for purposes of making any determination or
computation necessary or appropriate under this TRA, preparing any Tax Return
or contesting or defending any audit, examination or controversy with any
Taxing Authority, (b) make itself available to Parent and its representatives
to provide explanations of documents and materials and such other information
as Parent or its representatives may reasonably request in connection with any
of the matters described in clause (a) above, and (c) reasonably cooperate in
connection with any such matter, and Parent shall reimburse any such Minority
Member for any reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred pursuant to
this Section 6.4.

will be deemed given: (i) three (3) Business Days after such notice is mailed
to an address within the United States of America or (ii) seven (7) Business

addressees for notices; thereafter, notices are to be directed to those
substitute addresses or addressees.

  



  

Section 7.2. _Counterparts_. This TRA and any amendments may be executed
simultaneously in two or more counterparts and delivered via facsimile or
.pdf, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one and the same document. The signature of any
party to any counterpart shall be deemed a signature to, and may be appended
to, any other counterpart.

  



  

Section 7.3. _Entire TRA_ : No Third Party Beneficiaries. This TRA, together
with the LLC Agreement, the Exchange Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersedes all
prior agreements or arrangements (written and oral), including any prior
representation, statement, condition or warranty between the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This TRA is not intended to, and
does not, provide or create any rights or benefits of any Person other than
the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

Section 7.4. _Governing Law_. The parties hereto hereby agree that all
questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this
TRA and the performance of the obligations imposed by this TRA shall be
governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect
to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule, notwithstanding
that public policy in Delaware or any other forum jurisdiction might indicate
that the laws of that or any other jurisdiction should otherwise apply based
on contacts with such state or otherwise.

  



  

   

 | -18-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 7.5. _Severability_. It is expressly understood and agreed that if
any provision of this TRA or the application of any such provision to any
party or circumstance shall be determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of
this TRA, or the application of such provision to any party or circumstance
other than those to which it is so determined to be invalid or unenforceable,
shall not be affected thereby, and each provision hereof shall be enforced to
the fullest extent permitted by law so long as the economic or legal substance
of the matters contemplated by this TRA is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares or finds that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, or to
delete specific words or phrases, and to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this TRA shall be enforceable as so modified. If such
court of competent jurisdiction does not so replace an invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto will negotiate in good
faith to modify this TRA so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the matters
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 7.6. _Successors, Assignment, Amendments and Waivers_.

  



  

(a) No Minority Member may assign any of its rights under this TRA to any
person without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that (i) to the extent Units are
transferred in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement, the
transferring Minority Member shall have the option to assign to the transferee
of such Units the transferring Minority Member's rights under this TRA with
respect to such transferred Units, as long as such transferee has executed
and delivered, or, in connection with such transfer, executes and delivers, a
joinder to this TRA, in form and substance substantially similar to Exhibit A
to this TRA, agreeing to become a "Minority Member" for all purposes of this
TRA, except as otherwise provided in such joinder, and (ii) once an Exchange
has occurred, any and all payments that may become payable to a Minority
Member pursuant to this TRA with respect to the Exchanged Units may be
assigned to any Person or Persons as long as any such Person has executed and
delivered, or, in connection with such assignment, executes and delivers, a
joinder to this TRA, in form and substance substantially similar to Exhibit A
to this TRA, and acknowledging specifically the terms of Section 7.6(b). For
the avoidance of doubt, if a Minority Member transfers Units but does not
assign to the transferee of such Units such Minority Member's rights under
this TRA with respect to such transferred Units, such Minority Member shall
continue to be entitled to receive the Tax Benefit Payments arising in
respect of a subsequent Exchange of such Units.

  



  

(b) No provision of this TRA may be amended unless such amendment is approved
in writing by Parent and the TRA Representative (on behalf of the Minority
Members); provided, that, the definition of Change of Control cannot be
amended and no material amendment of this TRA may be made without the written
approval of the Required Independent Directors, Parent and the TRA
Representative (on behalf of the Minority Members). No provision of this TRA
may be waived unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective (which, with respect to waivers
applicable to all Minority Members, shall be the TRA Representative (on
behalf of the Minority Members)).

  



  

   

 | -19-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) All of the terms and provisions of this TRA shall be binding upon, shall
inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and
their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and
legal representatives. Parent shall require and cause any direct or indirect
successor (whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business or assets of Parent, by written agreement,
expressly to assume and agree to perform this TRA in the same manner and to
the same extent that Parent would be required to perform if no such succession
had taken place.

  



  

(d) In the event of a change in the Securityholder Representative under the
Merger Agreement, the successor Securityholder Representative shall become
the TRA Representative hereunder without further action of the parties.

  



  

Section 7.7. _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles of the sections and
subsections are for convenience of reference only and are not to be
considered in construing this TRA.

  



  

Section 7.8. _Resolution of Disputes_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties hereto submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this TRA and agrees that all claims in respect
of the action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court.
Each party hereto also agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this TRA in any other court. Each of the parties hereto
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might
be required of any other party hereto with respect thereto. The parties
hereto each agree that final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding on it and may be
enforced in any court to the jurisdiction of which it is subject by a suit
upon such judgment.

  



  

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 7.8.

  



  

   

 | -20-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 7.9. _Reconciliation_. In the event that Parent and the TRA
Representative or a Minority Member are unable to resolve a disagreement with
respect to the matters governed by Section 2.4, or Section 4.2, within the
relevant period designated in this TRA (" _Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the
Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a nationally
recognized expert (the " _Expert_ ") in the particular area of disagreement
mutually acceptable to both parties. The Expert shall be a partner or
principal in a nationally recognized accounting or law firm, and unless
Parent and the TRA Representative agree otherwise, the Expert shall not, and
the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any material relationship
with Parent or the TRA Representative (or the affected Minority Member(s)) or
other actual or potential conflict of interest. If the parties are unable to
agree on an Expert within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the respondent(s)
of written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, the Expert shall be
appointed by the Qualified Tax Advisor. The Expert shall resolve any matter
relating to an Exchange Basis Schedule, or an amendment thereto, the Early
Termination Schedule, or an amendment thereto, the Change of Control
Termination Schedule, or an amendment thereto or Section 3.l(c), within
thirty (30) calendar days and shall resolve any matter relating to a Tax
Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days or
as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter
has been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is
the subject of a disagreement would be due (in the absence of such
disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is
due, the undisputed amount shall be paid on the date prescribed by this TRA
and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by Parent, subject to adjustment
or amendment upon resolution. The costs and expenses relating to
the engagement of such Expert, amending any Tax Return and the proceeding
shall be borne by Parent except as provided in the next sentence. Parent and
the Minority Members shall bear their own costs and expenses of such
proceeding, unless the TRA Representative has a prevailing position that is
more than 10% of the payment at issue, in which case Parent shall reimburse
the Minority Members for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in
such proceeding. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a
Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this Section 7.9 shall be
decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any
Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this
Section 7.9 shall be binding on Parent and the TRA Representative (and the
affected Minority Member(s)) party to such Dispute and may be entered and
enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 7.10. _Withholding_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid to the applicable Minority Member. The parties anticipate
that, on the basis of current law, no federal income tax withholding would be
required with respect to any holder of Units who is a "United States person"
within the meaning of Section 770l(a)(30) of the Code and who
properly certified that such holder is not subject to federal backup
withholding.

Section 7.11. _Admission of Parent into a Consolidated Group and Transfers of
Corporate Assets_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Date, Parent will be the common parent of an
affiliated group of corporations that file a consolidated income tax return
pursuant to Section 1501 et seq. of Code. The provisions of this TRA will be
applied with respect to the group as a whole and the Tax Benefit Payments,
Early Termination Payments, Change of Control Termination Payments and other
applicable items shall be computed with reference to the consolidated taxable
income of the groups as a whole. Similar provisions apply to any state or
local consolidated group of which Parent is a member.

  



  

(b) If Parent transfers one or more assets to a corporation (or a Person
classified as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes)
with which it does not file a consolidated tax return pursuant to Section 1501
of the Code, then, for purposes of calculating the amount of any Tax Benefit
Payment, Early Termination Payment or Change of Control Termination Payment
due hereunder, Parent shall be treated as having disposed of such asset in a
fully taxable transaction on the date of such transfer. The
consideration deemed to be received by Parent shall be equal to the fair
market value of the transferred asset. For purposes of this Section 7.11, a
transfer of a partnership or limited liability company interest shall be
treated as a transfer of the transferring partner's or member's share of each
of the assets and liabilities of that partnership or limited liability
company.

  



  

Section 7.12. _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) The TRA Representative and each Minority Member and assignee acknowledges
and agrees that the information of Parent and of its Affiliates is
confidential and, except (i) in the course of performing any duties as
necessary for Parent and its Affiliates, (ii) as required by law or legal
process, (iii) to enforce the terms of this TRA, or (iv) such disclosure is
related to the performance of obligations under this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement, the Related Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereunder, such person shall keep and retain in the strictest
confidence and not disclose to any Person any confidential matters, acquired
pursuant to this TRA, of Parent and its Affiliates and successors, concerning
the Company and its Affiliates and successors or the other Minority Members,
learned by the TRA Representative or Minority Member heretofore or hereafter.
This Section 7.12(a) shall not apply to (i) any information that has been
made publicly available by Parent or any of its Affiliates, becomes
public knowledge (except as a result of an act of the TRA Representative or
such Minority Member in violation of this TRA) or is generally known to the
business community, (ii) the disclosure of information to the extent necessary
for the TRA Representative or a Minority Member to prepare and file his or
her Tax returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding the same from any
Taxing authority or to prosecute or defend any action, proceeding or audit by
any Taxing authority with respect to such returns, and (iii) was
independently developed by such TRA Representative or Minority Member,
provided that such independent development can reasonably be proven by such
TRA Representative's or Minority Member's written records.

  



  

(b) If the TRA Representative or a Minority Member or assignee commits a
breach, or threatens to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of Section
7.12(a), Parent shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions of
Section 7.12(a) specifically enforced by injunctive relief or otherwise by
any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other
security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened
breach shall cause irreparable injury to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
the TRA Representative or the other Minority Members and the accounts and
funds managed by Parent and that money damages alone shall not provide an
adequate remedy to such Persons. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available at law or in
equity.

powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws (" _Bylaws_ ") of the
Corporation, the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do
all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation,
subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL and this Amended and
Restated Certificate.

the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. Upon the effectiveness of this Amended and Restated
Certificate, the members of the Board shall be assigned to such classes in a
manner that is consistent with applicable disclosures made by the Corporation
in its definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the approval by the stockholders of the

successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at
that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. Subject to
_Section 5.5_ hereof, if the number of directors that constitute the Board is
changed, any increase or decrease in directorships shall be apportioned by
the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each
class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the
number of directors that constitute the Board shorten the term of any
incumbent director.

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the

such director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

_Section 5.5_ hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an increase
in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may

in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and
not by the stockholders of the Corporation), and any director so chosen shall
hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to
which the new directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and
until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however,
to such director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal.

then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

Section 5.5. _Preferred Stock - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Article V_ , and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal
from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such
directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to
this _Article V_ unless expressly provided by such terms.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt,
amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended,
altered or repealed by the stockholders of the Corporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Amended
and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to
adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and _provided further_ , _however_

Article VIII 
 LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1. _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the
extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted
under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any
amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

  



  

   

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 8.2. _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect
to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and
expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding.
The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law
pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnitee in
defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of
its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent
required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final
disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this
_Section 8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to
an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_ , except
for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board.

  



  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of the
Corporation's stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of
the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision
of this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this
_Section 8.2_ , shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only
(except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely
affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any
proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced
or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

   

 | -6-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) This _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  



  

Article IX 
 EXCLUSIVE FORUM

  



  

Section 9.1. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of
an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for
any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) of the Corporation to bring
(i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought or purporting to
be brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former
director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or
the Corporation's stockholders, creditors or other constituents, (iii) any
action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Corporation or any
of its current or former directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to
any provision of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate or the
Bylaws or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the
Corporation or any of its current or former directors, officers or employees
governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of clauses
(i) through (iv), any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that
there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such
determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or
forum other than the Court of Chancery or for which the Court of Chancery does
not have subject matter jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 9.2. Personal Jurisdiction. If any action the subject matter of which
is within the scope of _Section 9.1_ immediately above is filed in a court
other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a "Foreign Action")
in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have
consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in
any such court to enforce _Section 9.1 _ immediately above (an " _Enforcement
Action_ ") and (ii) having service of process made upon such stockholder in
any such Enforcement Action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the
Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

  



  

Section 9.3. If any provision of this _Article IX_ shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or circumstance
for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in any other
circumstance to such person and of the remaining provisions of this
_Article IX_ (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of
this _Article IX_ containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) to such person, and the application of such provision to other
persons and circumstances, shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest
in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have
received notice of and consented to the provisions of this _Article IX_.

Section 5. _Shares of Common Stock Subject to the Plan_.

  



  

5.1. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 8 hereof, the total number
of shares of Common Stock available for Awards under the Plan shall be
2,850,000 (the " _Plan Limit_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no more than
800,000 shares may be awarded to any Participant in any one calendar year.
For purposes of determining the number of shares available for Awards under
the Plan, each stock-settled SAR shall count against the Plan Limit based on
the number of shares underlying the exercised portion of such SAR rather than
the number of shares issued in settlement of such SAR. Any shares tendered,
with the Committee's approval, by a Participant in payment of an exercise
price for an Award or the tax liability with respect to an Award, including
shares withheld from any such Award, shall not be available for future Awards
hereunder. Common Stock awarded under the Plan may be reserved or made
available from the Company's authorized and unissued Common Stock or from
Common Stock reacquired and held in the Company's treasury. Any shares of
Common Stock issued by the Company through the assumption or substitution of
outstanding grants from an acquired company shall not reduce the shares
of Common Stock available for Awards under the Plan.

  



  

5.2. If any shares subject to an Award under the Plan are forfeited or such
Award otherwise terminates or is settled for any reason whatsoever without an
actual distribution of shares to the Participant, any shares counted against
the number of shares available for issuance pursuant to the Plan with respect
to such Award shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture, settlement, or
termination, again be available for Awards under the Plan; provided, however,
that the Committee may adopt procedures for the counting of shares relating
to any Award to ensure appropriate counting, avoid double counting,
provide for adjustments in any case in which the number of shares actually
distributed differs from the number of shares previously counted in
connection with such Award, and if necessary, to comply with applicable law or
regulations.

  



  

Section 6. _Awards_. Awards may be granted on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Section 6. In addition, the Committee may impose on any Award
or the settlement or exercise thereof, at the date of grant or thereafter,
such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of
the Plan, as the Committee shall determine, including without limitation
terms requiring forfeiture of Awards in the event of the termination of a
Participant's employment or other relationship with the Company or any
Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Committee shall retain full power to
accelerate or waive any such additional term or condition as it may have
previously imposed (provided that, in any case, any such action is
permitted under Code Section 409A). The right of a Participant to exercise or
receive a grant or settlement of any Award, and the timing thereof, may be
subject to such Performance Goals as may be determined by the Committee. Each
Award, and the terms and conditions applicable thereto, shall be evidenced by
an Award Agreement.

  



  

   

 | -7-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

6.1. _Options_. Options give a Participant the right to purchase a specified
number of shares of Common Stock from the Company for a specified time period
at a fixed exercise price, as provided in the applicable Award Agreement. The
grant of Options shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

  



  

(a) _Exercise Price_. The price per share at which Common Stock may be
purchased upon exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Committee and
specified in the Award Agreement, but shall be not less than the Fair Market
Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant.

  



  

(b)  _Term of Options._ The term of an Option shall be specified in the Award
Agreement, but shall in no event be greater than ten years.

  



  

(c) _Exercise of Option._ Each Award Agreement with respect to an Option
shall specify the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole
or in part and the terms and conditions applicable thereto, including (i) a
vesting schedule which may be based upon the passage of time, attainment of
Performance Goals or a combination thereof, (ii) whether the exercise
price for an Option shall be paid in cash, with shares of Common Stock, with
any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, or with other legal
consideration that the Committee may deem appropriate, (iii) the methods of
payment, which may include payment through cashless and net exercise
arrangements, to the extent permitted by applicable law and (iv) the methods
by which, or the time or times at which, Common Stock will be delivered or
deemed to be delivered to Participants upon the exercise of such Option.
Payment of the exercise price shall in all events be made within three days
after the date of exercise of an Option. Participants who are subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act may elect to pay all
or a portion of the exercise price of an Option by directing the Company to
withhold shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be received upon
exercise of such Option.

  



  

(d)  _Termination of Employment or Other Service_. Unless otherwise provided
in an Award Agreement or as may be determined by the Committee, upon a
Participant's termination of employment or other service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries, the unvested portion of such Participant's Options shall
cease to vest and shall be forfeited with no further compensation due to
the Participant and the vested portion of such Participant's Options shall
remain exercisable by the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary or
legal representative, as the case may be, for a period of (i) 90 days in the
event of a Participant's termination of service by the Company or a
Subsidiary without Cause, (ii) one year in the event of a Participant's
termination of service due to death or Disability and (iii) 30 days in the
event of a Participant's voluntary termination of service; provided, however,
that in no event shall any Option be exercisable after its stated term has
expired. All of a Participant's Options, whether or not vested, shall be
forfeited immediately upon such Participant's termination by the Company or a
Subsidiary for Cause.

  



  

6.2. _Stock Appreciation Rights_. An SAR shall confer on the Participant a
right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (i) the Fair Market
Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over (ii) the grant
price of the SAR as determined by the Committee, but which may never be less
than the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of grant.
The grant of SARs shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

  



  

(a) _General_. Each Award Agreement with respect to an SAR shall specify the
number of SARs granted, the grant price of the SAR, the time or times at
which an SAR may be exercised in whole or in part (including vesting upon the
passage of time, the attainment of Performance Goals, or a combination
thereof), the method of exercise, method of settlement (in cash, Common Stock
or a combination thereof), method by which Common Stock will be delivered or
deemed to be delivered to Participants (if applicable) and any other terms
and conditions of any SAR.

(b)  _Termination of Employment or Other Service_. Unless otherwise provided
in an Award Agreement or as may be determined by the Committee, upon a

Participant and the vested portion of such Participant's SARs shall remain
exercisable by the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary or legal
representative, as the case may be, for a period of (i) 90 days in the event
of a Participant's termination of service by the Company or a Subsidiary
without Cause, (ii) one year in the event of a Participant's termination of
service due to death or Disability and (iii) 30 days in the event of a
Participant's voluntary termination of service; provided, however, that in no
event shall any SAR be exercisable after its stated term has expired. All of a
Participant's SARs, whether or not vested, shall be forfeited immediately
upon such Participant's termination by the Company or a Subsidiary for Cause.

  



  

(c) _Term_. The term of an SAR shall be specified in the Award Agreement, but
shall in no event be greater than ten years.

  



  

6.3. _Restricted Stock_. An Award of Restricted Stock is a grant by the
Company of a specified number of shares of Common Stock to the Participant,
which shares are subject to forfeiture upon the happening of specified events
during the Restriction Period. Such an Award shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:

  



  

(a) _General_. Each Award Agreement with respect to Restricted Stock shall
specify the duration of the Restriction Period, if any, and/or
each installment thereof, the conditions under which the Restricted Stock may
be forfeited to the Company, and the amount, if any, the Participant must pay
to receive the Restricted Stock. Such restrictions may include a vesting
schedule based upon the passage of time, the attainment of Performance Goals
or a combination thereof.

  



  

(b) _Transferability_. During the Restriction Period, if any, the
transferability of Restricted Stock shall be prohibited or restricted in
the manner and to the extent prescribed in the applicable Award Agreement.
Such restrictions may include, without limitation, rights of repurchase or
first refusal in the Company or provisions subjecting the Restricted Stock to
a continuing substantial risk of forfeiture in the hands of any transferee.

  



  

(c) _Shareholder Rights_. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award
Agreement, during the Restriction Period the Participant shall have all the
rights of a shareholder with respect to Restricted Stock, including, without
limitation, the right to receive dividends thereon (whether in cash or shares
of Common Stock) and to vote such shares of Restricted Stock. Dividends shall
be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying Restricted Stock unless
otherwise provided by the Committee.

(d)  _Termination of Employment or Other Service_. Unless otherwise provided
in an Award Agreement or as may be determined by the Committee, upon a
Participant's termination of employment or other service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries for any reason, the unvested portion of each Award of
Restricted Stock held by such Participant shall be forfeited with no further
compensation due the Participant.

  



  

6.4. _Restricted Stock Units_. Restricted Stock Units are solely a device for
the measurement and determination of the amounts to be paid to a Participant
under the Plan. Restricted Stock Units do not constitute Common Stock and
shall not be treated as (or as giving rise to) property or as a trust fund of
any kind; provided, however, that the Company may establish a
bookkeeping reserve to meet its obligations hereunder or a trust or other
funding vehicle that would not cause the Plan to be deemed to be funded for
tax purposes or for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended. The right of any Participant in respect of
an Award of Restricted Stock Units shall be no greater than the right of any
unsecured general creditor of the Company. The grant of Restricted Stock
Units shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

  



  

(a) _Restriction Period_. Each Award Agreement with respect to Restricted
Stock Units shall specify the duration of the Restriction Period, if any,
and/or each installment thereof and the conditions under which such Award may
be forfeited to the Company. Such restrictions may include a vesting schedule
based upon the passage of time, the attainment of Performance Goals or
a combination thereof.

in an Award Agreement or as may be determined by the Committee, upon a
Participant's termination of employment or other service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries for any reason, the unvested portion of each Award of
Restricted Stock Units credited to such Participant shall be forfeited with no
compensation due the Participant.

  



  

(c) _Settlement_. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement (i) an
Award of Restricted Stock Units shall be settled in shares of Common Stock,
provided that any fractional Restricted Stock Units shall be settled in cash
and (ii) subject to the Participant's continued employment or other service
with the Company or a Subsidiary from the date of grant through
the expiration of the Restriction Period (or applicable portion thereof), the
vested portion of an Award of Restricted Stock Units shall be settled within
30 days after the expiration of the Restriction Period (or applicable portion
thereof).

  



  

(d)  _Shareholder Rights_. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed
to give any Participant rights as a shareholder with respect to an Award of
Restricted Stock Units (including, without limitation, any voting, dividend or
derivative or other similar rights). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Committee may provide in an Award Agreement that amounts equal to any
dividends declared during the Restriction Period and, if applicable, any
deferral period, on the shares of Common Stock represented by an Award
of Restricted Stock Units will be credited to the Participant's account and
deemed to be reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units, such additional
Restricted Stock Units to be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions and
payment elections, if any, as the Restricted Stock Units to which they
relate.

outstanding Awards such that all outstanding Awards are fully vested and, if
applicable, exercisable (effective immediately prior to such Change
in Control).

  



  

7.2. _Options and SARs_. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the
contrary, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Committee, in its
discretion, may take one or more of the following actions with respect to all
Options and SARs that are outstanding as of such Change in Control: (a)
cancel all outstanding Options or SARs in exchange for a cash payment in
an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock underlying the unexercised portion of the Option or SAR as of the date
of the Change in Control over the exercise price or grant price, as the case
may be, of such portion, provided that any Option or SAR with an exercise
price or grant price, as the case may be, that equals or exceeds the Fair
Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of such Change in Control shall
be cancelled with no payment due the Participant; (b) terminate all Options
or SARs, effective immediately prior to the Change in Control, provided that
the Company provides the Participant an opportunity to exercise such Award
within a specified period following the Participant's receipt of a written
notice of such Change in Control and the Company's intention to terminate
such Awards, effective immediately prior to such Change in Control; or (c)
require the successor corporation, following a Change in Control if the
Company does not survive such Change in Control, to assume all outstanding
Options or SARs and to substitute such Options or SARs with awards involving
the common stock of such successor corporation on terms and
conditions necessary to preserve the rights of Participants with respect to
such Options or SARs.

Agreement or an election form that, upon the occurrence of a Change

Committee may take such other actions as it deems appropriate with respect to
any other type of Award granted under the Plan.

  



  

The judgment of the Committee with respect to any matter referred to in this
Section 7 shall be conclusive and binding upon each Participant without the
need for any amendment to the Plan.

Section 8. _Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization_.

  



  

8.1. In the event that the Committee shall determine that any stock dividend,
recapitalization, forward split or reverse split, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase or share exchange,
extraordinary or unusual cash distribution or other similar corporate
transaction or event, affects the Common Stock such that an adjustment is
appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of
Participants under the Plan, then the Committee shall proportionately and
equitably adjust any or all of (i) the number and kind of shares of Common
Stock which may thereafter be issued in connection with Awards, (ii) the
number and kind of shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of
outstanding Awards, (iii) the aggregate number and kind of shares of Common
Stock available under the Plan, (iv) the limits described in Section 5 of the

outstanding Award.

terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards, including any
Performance Goals, in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events
(including, without limitation, events described in Section 8.1) affecting
the Company or any Subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable
laws, regulations, or accounting principles.

9.1. _Changes to the Plan and Awards_. The Board may amend, alter, suspend,
discontinue, or terminate the Plan without the consent of the Company's
shareholders or Participants, except that any such amendment, alteration,
suspension, discontinuation, or termination shall be subject to the approval
of the Company's shareholders if (i) such action would decrease the price at
which outstanding Awards may be exercised or (ii) such shareholder approval is
required by any applicable federal, state or foreign law or regulation or the
rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Common
Stock may then be listed or quoted, and the Board may otherwise, in its
discretion, determine to submit such other changes to the Plan to the
Company's shareholders for approval; provided, however, that without the
consent of an affected Participant, no amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuation, or termination of the Plan may materially and
adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any outstanding Award
unless such modification is necessary to ensure a deduction under Section
162(m) of the Code, if applicable, or to avoid the additional tax described in
Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

9.2. The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, or amend, alter,
suspend, discontinue, or terminate, any Award theretofore granted and any
Award Agreement relating thereto; provided, however, that without the consent
of an affected Participant, no such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuation, or termination of any Award may materially and adversely
affect the rights of such Participant under such Award, unless such
modification is necessary to ensure a deduction under Section 162(m) of the
Code, if applicable, or to avoid the additional tax described in Section 409A
of the Code.

  



  

   

 | -12-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

9.3. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9 to the contrary, any
Performance Goal applicable to an Award shall not be deemed a fixed
contractual term, but shall remain subject to adjustment by the Committee, in
its discretion at any time in view of the Committee's assessment of the
Company's strategy, performance of comparable companies, and other
circumstances, except to the extent that any such adjustment to a performance
condition would adversely affect the status of an Award intended to satisfy
the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception under Section 162(m)
of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

  



  

Section 10. _No Right to Award, Employment or Service_. No Participant shall
have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no
obligation that the terms of Awards be uniform or consistent among
Participants. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be
construed as giving any Participant any right to be retained in the employ or
service of the Company or any Subsidiary. For purposes of this Plan, a
transfer of employment or service between the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be deemed a termination of employment or service; provided,
however, that individuals employed by, or otherwise providing services to,
an entity that ceases to be a Subsidiary shall be deemed to have incurred a
termination of employment or service, as the case may be, as of the date such
entity ceases to be a Subsidiary unless such individual becomes an employee
of, or service provider to, the Company or another Subsidiary as of the date
of such cessation.

  



  

Section 11. _Taxes_. Each Participant must make appropriate arrangement for
the payment of any taxes relating to an Award granted hereunder. The Company
or any Subsidiary is authorized to withhold from any payment relating to an
Award under the Plan, including from a distribution of Common Stock or any
payroll or other payment to a Participant, amounts of withholding and other
taxes due in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take
such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company
and Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes
and other tax obligations relating to any Award. This authority shall include
the ability to withhold or receive Common Stock or other property and to make
cash payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of a Participant's tax
obligations. Participants who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act may elect to direct to the Company to withhold
shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be received upon the vesting,
settlement or exercise of an Award to satisfy the withholding taxes
applicable to such Award. Withholding of taxes in the form of shares of Common
Stock with respect to an Award shall not occur at a rate that exceeds the
minimum required statutory federal and state withholding rates.

  



  

Section 12. _Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries_. No Award or other
right or interest of a Participant under the Plan shall be pledged,
encumbered, or hypothecated to, or in favor of, or subject to any lien,
obligation, or liability of such Participant to, any party, other than the
Company or any Subsidiary, or assigned or transferred by such Participant
otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and such
Awards and rights shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant
only by the Participant or his or her guardian or legal representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide
that Awards or other rights or interests of a Participant granted pursuant to
the Plan be transferable, without consideration, to immediate family members
(i.e., children, grandchildren or spouse), to trusts for the benefit of such
immediate family members and to partnerships in which such family members are
the only partners. The Committee may attach to such transferability feature
such terms and conditions as it deems advisable. In addition, a Participant
may, in the manner established by the Committee, designate a beneficiary
(which may be a person or a trust) to exercise the rights of the Participant,
and to receive any distribution, with respect to any Award upon the death of
the Participant. A beneficiary, guardian, legal representative or other
person claiming any rights under the Plan from or through any Participant
shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award
Agreement applicable to such Participant, except as otherwise determined by
the Committee, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary
or appropriate by the Committee.

Section 13. _Securities Law Requirements_.

  



  

13.1. No shares of Common Stock may be issued hereunder if the Company shall
at any time determine that to do so would (i) violate the listing
requirements of an applicable securities exchange, or adversely affect the
registration or qualification of the Company's Common Stock under any state
or federal law, or (ii) require the consent or approval of any regulatory
body or the satisfaction of withholding tax or other withholding liabilities.
In any of the events referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) above, the
issuance of such shares shall be suspended and shall not be effective unless
and until such withholding, listing, registration, qualifications or approval
shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to
the Company in its sole discretion, notwithstanding any termination of any
Award or any portion of any Award during the period when issuance has been
suspended.

  



  

13.2. The Committee may require, as a condition to the issuance of shares
hereunder, representations, warranties and agreements to the effect that such
shares are being purchased or acquired by the Participant for investment only
and without any present intention to sell or otherwise distribute such shares
and that the Participant will not dispose of such shares in transactions
which, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, would violate the
registration provisions of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

  



  

13.3. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or any Award
Agreement, all Awards granted hereunder shall be subject to any clawback
policy that the Company may adopt in order to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and/or any related Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations.

  



  

Section 14. _Termination_. Unless earlier terminated, the Plan shall
terminate on the 10th anniversary of its approval by the Board, and no Awards
under the Plan shall thereafter be granted.

  



  

Section 15. _Fractional Shares_. The Company will not be required to issue
any fractional shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan. The Committee may
provide for the elimination of fractions and settlement of such fractional
shares of Common Stock in cash.

  



  

Section 16. _Governing Law_. The validity and construction of the Plan and
any Award Agreements entered into thereunder shall be construed and enforced
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, but without giving
effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  



  

Section 17. _Effective Date_. The Plan shall become effective upon the
Effective Date.

 _TERM SHEET FOR PARENT PREFERRED STOCK_

  



  

INTRODUCTORY NOTES: Except as set forth below, the Parent preferred stock
issuable in exchange for the Class C Units and Class D Units shall have
substantially equivalent rights, preferences and privileges as the Class C
Units and Class D Units. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Term
Sheet shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Company's Seventh Amended and Restated Operating Agreement ("
_Operating Agreement_ ").

  



     _Mandatory Dividends:_   | The holders of the Series A Preferred
shall be entitled to receive, in preference and priority to any dividends on
the Parent common stock and all other series of Parent preferred stock,
mandatory annual dividends of the Series A Dividend Amount, in cash, prorated
monthly and payable on the 15th day of calendar each month. In the event that
full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred have not been declared and
paid or set apart for payment when due, the Corporation shall not declare and
pay or set apart for payment any dividends or make any distributions on, or
make any payment on account of the purchase, redemption or retirement of any
shares of any Parent common stock or any other series of Parent preferred
stock. The " _Series A Dividend Amount_ " means: 
---|--- 
  



   | (i)| In respect of the period from and after the Exchange Date to and
including the last day of the then-current Fiscal Year, an amount equal to
the aggregate then-current annualized Class C Distribution and Class D
Distribution  _multiplied by_ (the number of calendar days remaining in such
Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2017 following the Exchange Date divided by the
total number of days in such Fiscal Year); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| In respect of each Fiscal Year thereafter, the product of: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| one (1) plus any positive percentage change (or minus any
negative percentage change) in Same Program Revenues (expressed as a decimal
carried four places) for the most recently completed Fiscal Year, compared to
the next preceding Fiscal Year, _multiplied by_ 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| the annualized amount of the Series A Dividend Amount calculated
with respect to the most recently completed Fiscal Year; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

provided, that any such positive or negative percentage change in Same
Program Revenues shall be limited to a positive or negative (as applicable)
five percent (5%) change per Fiscal Year.

  



  

   



 

    



   | (iii)| Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if at any time any
shares of Series A Preferred are converted to Parent common stock, the Series
A Dividend Amount shall immediately be reduced to an amount equal to the
product of (a) the number of shares of Series A Preferred outstanding
following such conversion, and (b) the quotient of (x) the Series A
Dividend Amount immediately prior to such conversion, and (y) the number of
shares of Series A Preferred outstanding immediately prior to such
conversion. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| In the event any monthly installment of the Series A Dividend
Amount is not paid within 30 days of the date due (but such installment is
paid prior to the one (1)-year anniversary of the date due), the amount of
each such delinquent installment of the Series A Dividend Amount, as adjusted
pursuant to the preceding clause (iii) and the following clause (vi), shall
be automatically increased by an amount equal to 1/12th of 2% of the capital
contributions made in respect of all shares of Series A Preferred outstanding
as of such date due, until paid. In the event any monthly installment of the
Series A Dividend Amount remains unpaid for more than one (1) year following
the date due (but such installment is paid prior to the two
(2)-year anniversary of the date due), the amount of each such delinquent
Series A Dividend Amount, as adjusted pursuant to the preceding clause (iii)
and the following clause (vi), shall be automatically increased by an amount
equal to 1/12th of 4% of the capital contributions made in respect of all
shares of Series A Preferred outstanding as of such date due, until paid. In
the event any monthly installment of the Series A Dividend Amount remains
unpaid for more than two (2) years following the date due, the amount of each
such delinquent Series A Dividend Amount, as adjusted pursuant to the
preceding clause (iii) and the following clause (vi), shall be automatically
increased by an amount equal to 1/12th of 5% of the capital contributions made
in respect of all shares of Series A Preferred outstanding as of such date
due, until paid.

---|---|--- 

 

    



       | (v)  | Effective as of the 42-Month Anniversary, and again
effective as of the one (1)-year anniversary of the 42-Month Anniversary, and
again effective as of each successive such one (1)-year anniversary occurring
thereafter, and in addition to any other adjustments to the Series A Dividend
Amount set forth herein, the annualized Series A Dividend Amount shall be
automatically recalculated and adjusted to an amount equal to the product of
(A plus B) _multiplied by_ C, where: 
---|---|--- 
    



   | A  | =| 100 basis points 
---|---|---|--- 
  



   | B  | =| the annualized Series A Dividend Amount as of immediately
prior thereto divided by the capital contributions made in respect of all
shares of Series A Preferred then outstanding 
---|---|---|--- 
  



   | C  | =| the capital contributions made in respect of all shares of
Series A Preferred then outstanding 
---|---|---|---

Preferred) in the same manner and on the same terms as the previous monthly
installments of the Series A Dividend Amount. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vii)| At no time shall any Series A Dividend Amount be less than
zero. 
---|---|--- 
  



     _Liquidation Preference:_   | In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of Parent, whether voluntary or involuntary,  the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of
the assets of Parent available for distribution  to the stockholders of

   | (i)| all installments of the Series A Dividend Amount that are due and
payable; and

the applicable Current Prices of the Escrowed Units to be delivered to Parent
exceeds Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), the objecting party shall, prior to
11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the
Parent Certificate, deliver to Parent and the Escrow Agent a certificate
specifying in reasonable detail (a) each such amount to which the objecting
party objects, and (b) the nature and basis for each such objection (the "
_Objection Notice_ "). If the Escrow Agent shall have received an Objection
Notice contesting the amount claimed in the Parent Certificate, the amount so
contested (the " _Contested Amount_ ") shall continue to be held by the Escrow
Agent pending resolution of the claim in the Parent Certificate and Objection
Notice. If the non-claiming party shall not deliver to claiming party and the
Escrow Agent an Objection Notice in response to any claim in a Parent
Certificate, within 30 days after delivery by of such certificate, the Escrow
Agent, in no event later than the thirty-first (31st) day after the receipt of
the Parent Certificate, shall deliver to the claiming party (or any party
designated in the Parent Certificate) the number of Escrowed Units as set
forth in the Parent Certificate, to the extent that such Escrowed Units are
available in the Escrow Account. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Escrow
Agent shall be able to rely conclusively and without further inquiry that the
date it receives a Claim Notice shall be the same date that such Parent
Certificate was received by the non-claiming party.

1.5 _Disbursements_. Except as set forth below in _Section 2.7_ , if,
as of the termination of the Escrow Period (the " _Escrow Termination Date_
"), there are any Escrowed Units remaining in the Escrow Account (the "
_Escrow Balance_ "), then Parent and Securityholder Representative shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent Joint Instructions to distribute the Escrow
Balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the Escrow Termination
Date, the Escrow Agent has received one or more claims pursuant to _Sections
1.3_ or _1.4_ which involve amounts unresolved on the Escrow Termination Date
(" _Outstanding Claims_ "), then the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold in
the Escrow Account the number of Escrowed Units set forth in the Outstanding
Claims unless otherwise provided in the Joint Instructions. From time to time
promptly after final resolution of any indemnification claim set forth in any
notice relating to an Outstanding Claim, Parent and the Securityholder
Representative will provide Joint Instructions to the Escrow Agent
authorizing the Escrow Agent to disburse all Escrowed Units remaining in the
Escrow Account to Parent and the Securityholder Representative in the same
manner as described above. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, if at any time after the Escrow Termination Date the Escrow Balance
from time to time exceeds the aggregate number of Escrowed Units of all
Outstanding Claims, the Escrow Agent shall promptly cause such excess to be
delivered to the Survivor after receipt of Joint Instructions in accordance
with the procedures of _Section 1.2_ above.

  



  

1.6 _Class B Unit Certificates_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided in this Escrow Agreement, (i) all Escrowed Units
delivered to, and held by, the Escrow Agent pursuant to any provision of this
Escrow Agreement shall be represented by no more than one certificate of the
Survivor, (ii) all Escrowed Units delivered to and held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to any provision of this Escrow Agreement shall be registered on the
books and records of the issuer thereof in the name of the Escrow Agent in its
capacity as Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement, (iii) Escrowed Units
delivered to and held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to any provision of this
Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding Class B Units of
the Survivor for notice, quorum, voting or dividend purposes (and shall be
deemed issued and outstanding for purposes of any applicable lock-up period
related thereto) and any dividends issued thereon shall be delivered to the
Escrow Agent to be held in an escrow account by the Escrow Agent
and distributed pursuant to Joint Instructions, (iv) the Escrow Agent shall
have no duty or obligation to distribute or disburse any Escrowed Units
except to Parent or the Survivor , in each case, in accordance with a Joint
Instruction and any such instruction shall set forth the number of Escrowed
Units to be distributed and the mailing instructions. Parent and the
Securityholder Representative agree that in no event shall the number of
Escrowed Units be delivered to Parent which exceeds the quotient of Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000) divided by the sum of the Current Prices, as
applicable, with respect to each such delivered Escrowed Units;
provided, however that the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to
determine compliance with this Section 1.6, or to calculate such amounts, and
may conclusively rely upon the Joint Instructions, or any order, decree or
judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction, with no liability therefor.
If applicable, Parent shall cause the Survivor to deposit with the Escrow
Agent certificate(s) representing any balance of Escrowed Units to be
retained by the Escrow Agent in accordance with such Joint Instruction. Each
notice, certificate or other communication delivered to the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this Escrow Agreement shall state the specific section or sub-
section of this Escrow Agreement pursuant to which it is delivered.

1.7  _Escrow Income_. Securityholder Representative and Parent agree,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, that any interest, income,
cash distributions or other similar consideration (" _Escrow Income_ ")
received by the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrowed Units shall be
deemed to be for the account of the Securityholders, and all such Escrow
Income and any income or loss of the Company attributed to the holders of
Escrowed Units shall be allocable to the Securityholders in the respective
amounts set forth in a Joint Instruction for tax purposes. Any
Joint Instruction relating to the Escrow Income shall include the amount to
be disbursed and shall identify the party to whom the disbursement shall be
made. Promptly upon receipt of any Escrow Income, but in no event later than
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such Escrow Income, Escrow Agent
shall pay such Escrow Income to the Payments Administrator to be distributed
to the Securityholders in accordance with the Joint Instruction. The Escrow
Income shall be reported, as and to the extent required by law, by the
Escrow Agent to the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), or any other taxing
authority, on IRS Form 1099 or 1042-S (or other appropriate form) as income
earned on the Escrow Account by the Securityholders in accordance with the
Joint Instruction.

  



  

1.8 The Representative Fund is solely for the use of the Securityholder
Representative and shall not be available to Parent in satisfaction of any
indemnification obligations of the Securityholders pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or otherwise. From time to time and as directed by the
Securityholder Representative, the Escrow Agent will distribute amounts to the
Securityholder Representative and/or third parties, until the Representative
Fund is equal to zero. If, as of the third anniversary of the Effective Time,
there are any funds remaining in the Representative Account, then, within
fifteen (15) days of such date, Securityholder Representative shall instruct
the Escrow Agent in writing to distribute an amount equal to one-half of the
amount then remaining in the Escrow Account. If, as of the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, there are any funds remaining in the Representative
Account, then, within fifteen (15) days of such date, Securityholder
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to distribute the
balance of the amount then remaining in the Escrow Account.

  



     II.  | Provisions as to the Escrow Agent 
---|--- 
    



  

2.1. This Escrow Agreement expressly and exclusively sets forth the
duties of the Escrow Agent with respect to any and all matters
pertinent hereto and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this
Escrow Agreement against the Escrow Agent. In performing its duties under
this Escrow Agreement, or upon the claimed failure to perform its duties, the
Escrow Agent shall have no liability except for the Escrow Agent's fraud,
willful misconduct or gross negligence. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be
liable for incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages
of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if
the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability
with respect to the transfer or distribution of any Escrowed Units effected by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to Joint Instructions provided to the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the provisions of this Escrow Agreement. Any distributions
or disbursements of Escrowed Units made by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Escrow Agreement will be made subject to and in accordance with the Escrow
Agent's usual and ordinary transfer procedures in effect from time to time. No
provision of this Escrow Agreement shall require the Escrow Agent to risk or
advance its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability or potential
financial liability in the performance of its duties or the exercise of its
rights under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated
to take any legal action or to commence any proceedings in connection with
this Escrow Agreement or any property held hereunder or to appear in,
prosecute or defend in any such legal action or proceedings.

  



  

2.2. Parent and the Securityholder Representative acknowledge and agree
that the Escrow Agent acts hereunder as a depository only, and is not
responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the sufficiency,
correctness, genuineness or validity of the subject matter of this Escrow
Agreement or any part thereof, or of any person executing or depositing such
subject matter.

  



  

   

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

2.3. This Escrow Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
Escrow Agent and Parent and the Securityholder Representative in connection
with the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement, and no other agreement
entered into between Parent and the Securityholder Representative, or either
of them, including, without limitation, the Merger Agreement, shall be
considered as adopted or binding, in whole or in part, upon the Escrow Agent
notwithstanding that any such other agreement may be deposited with the Escrow
Agent or the Escrow Agent may have knowledge thereof.

  



  

2.4. The Escrow Agent shall in no way be responsible for nor shall it
be its duty to notify any party hereto or any other party interested in this
Escrow Agreement of any payment required or maturity occurring under this
Escrow Agreement or under the terms of any instrument deposited therewith
unless such notice is explicitly provided for in this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

2.5. The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any written
instruction, notice, request, waiver, consent, certificate,
receipt, authorization, power of attorney or other paper or document which
the Escrow Agent in good faith believes to be genuine and what it purports,
to be, including, but not limited to, items directing investment or non-
investment of funds, items requesting or authorizing release, disbursement or
retainage of the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement and items amending
the terms of this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

2.6. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of
its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates or agents and shall not
be liable for the acts or omissions of any such agent appointed with due care.
The Escrow Agent and any director, officer or employee of the Escrow Agent
may become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which any of the other
parties hereto may be interested and may contract and lend money to any such
party and otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not escrow
agent under this Escrow Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Escrow
Agent from acting in any other capacity for any such party. The Escrow Agent
may consult with legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to
the construction of any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, and
it shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected in acting in
accordance with the advice of such counsel.

  



  

2.7. In the event of any disagreement between Parent and the
Securityholder Representative , or between either of them and any other
party, resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with
the matters covered by this Escrow Agreement, or in the event that the Escrow
Agent, in good faith, be in reasonable doubt as to what action it should take
hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, refuse to comply with any
claims or demands on it, or refuse to take any other action hereunder, so long
as such disagreement continues or such reasonable doubt exists, and in any
such event, the Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable in any way or to
any party for its failure or refusal to act, and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to continue to refrain from acting until (i) the rights of Parent
and the Securityholder Representative and all other interested parties shall
have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction,
or (ii) all differences shall have been adjudged and all doubt resolved by
agreement among Parent and the Securityholder Representative and all other
interested parties, and the Escrow Agent shall have been notified thereof in
writing signed by Parent and the Securityholder Representative.
Notwithstanding the preceding, the Escrow Agent may in its discretion obey
the order, judgment, decree or levy of any court, whether with or without
jurisdiction, or of an agency of the United States or any political
subdivision thereof, or of any agency of any State of the United States or
of any political subdivision thereof, and the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized in its sole discretion, to comply with and obey any such orders,
judgments, decrees or levies. The rights of the Escrow Agent under this sub-
paragraph are cumulative of all other rights which it may have by law or
otherwise.

  



  

   

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

In the event of any disagreement or doubt, as described above, the Escrow
Agent shall have the right, in addition to the rights described above and at
the election of the Escrow Agent, to tender into the registry or custody of
any court having jurisdiction, all property held under this Escrow Agreement,
and the Escrow Agent shall have the right to take such other legal action as
may be appropriate or necessary, in the sole discretion of the Escrow Agent.
Upon such tender, Parent and the Securityholder Representative agree that the
Escrow Agent shall be discharged from all further duties under this Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

2.8. Parent and the Securityholder Representative (solely on behalf of
the Securityholders and in its capacity as the Securityholder
Representative, not in its individual capacity) jointly and severally agree
to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent and each of the
Escrow Agent's officers, directors, agents and employees (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims made by
any Party or any other person or entity, damages, expenses and costs
(including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) of every nature
whatsoever (collectively, " _Losses_ ") which any such Indemnified Party may
incur and which arise directly or indirectly from this Escrow Agreement or
which arise directly or indirectly by virtue of the Escrow Agent's
undertaking to serve as the Escrow Agent hereunder; provided, however,
that no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnity with respect to
Losses that have been finally adjudicated by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have been directly caused by such Indemnified
Party's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The provisions of this
section shall survive the termination of this Escrow Agreement and any
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

  



  

2.9. Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted
or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or
substantially all the escrow business of the Escrow Agent may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further act.

  



  

2.10. The Escrow Agent may resign at any time from its obligations under
this Escrow Agreement by providing written notice to Parent and the
Securityholder Representative. Such resignation shall be effective on the date
set forth in such written notice, which shall be no earlier than thirty (30)
days after such written notice has been furnished. Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall promptly appoint a successor escrow
agent. In the event no successor escrow agent has been appointed on or prior
to the date such resignation is to become effective, the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to tender into the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction
all Escrowed Units and other property then held by the Escrow Agent hereunder
and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon be relieved of all further duties and
obligations under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility for the appointment of a successor escrow agent hereunder.

  



     III.  | Compensation of the Escrow Agent 
---|--- 
    



  

3.1. The Escrow Agent shall not charge fees to Parent and the
Securityholder Representative for the services provided by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the terms of this paragraph shall not in
any way limit the rights of the Escrow Agent to indemnification as set forth
in this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

   

 | -6-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



     IV.  | Miscellaneous 
---|--- 
    



  

4.1 The Escrow Agent shall make no disbursement, investment or other
use of funds until and unless it has collected funds. The Escrow Agent shall

4.2. The Escrow Agent shall invest all funds held pursuant to this
Escrow Agreement in accordance with _Exhibit C_. Instructions to make any
other investment must be in writing and signed by each of the Parties. Parent

investment of moneys held hereunder or the purchase, sale, retention or other
disposition of any investment, and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable
to Parent or the Securityholder Representative or any other person or entity
for any loss incurred in connection with any such investment. The Escrow
Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments
through the facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or
those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent, Acquiom and/or any of their
affiliates may receive compensation with respect to any investment directed

connection with each transaction. The Escrow Agent shall use its best efforts
to invest funds on a timely basis upon receipt of such funds; _provided,
however_ , that the Escrow Agent shall in no event be liable for compensation
to Parent or the Securityholder Representative or any other person or entity
related to funds which are held un-invested or funds which are not invested
timely. The Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to sell or redeem any
investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or
distributions required under this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

4.3 The Escrow Agent shall provide monthly reports of transactions and
holdings to Parent and the Securityholder Representative as of the end of

Representative.

  



  

4.4 On or before the execution and delivery of this Escrow Agreement,
each of Parent and Securityholder Representative, for itself and for each of
the Securityholders, shall provide to the Escrow Agent a correct, duly
completed, dated and executed current IRS Form W-9 or the applicable Form
W-8, whichever is appropriate or any successor forms thereto, in a form and
substance satisfactory to the Escrow Agent including appropriate supporting
documentation and/or any other form, document, and/or certificate required or
reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent to validate the form provided.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein provided, except for the
delivery and filing of tax information reporting forms required pursuant to
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to be delivered and filed with
the IRS by the Escrow Agent, and any required state and local tax information
forms to be delivered and filed with the appropriate state and local tax
authorities by the Escrow Agent, as escrow agent hereunder, the Escrow Agent
shall have no duty to prepare or file any Federal or state tax report or
return with respect to the Escrowed Units pursuant to this Escrow Agreement
or any income earned thereon. Parent and the Securityholder Representative
(solely on behalf of the Securityholders and in its capacity as the
Securityholder Representative, not in its individual capacity), jointly and
severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from
and against any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense
that may be assessed against the Escrow Agent on or with respect to the
Escrowed Units or any earnings or interest thereon unless such tax, late
payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense was finally
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been directly caused
by the fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent.
The indemnification provided in this section is in addition to the
indemnification provided to the Escrow Agent elsewhere in this Escrow
Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and
the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

laws of the State of Delaware. Except as permitted in _Section 2.9_ , neither
this Escrow Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned
by any party hereto without the express written consent of each of the other

the form of _Exhibit A-1_ and _A-2_ hereto (a " _Certificate of Incumbency_
") for the purpose of establishing the identity and authority of persons
entitled to issue notices, instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent on
behalf of each such party. Until such time as the Escrow Agent shall receive
an amended Certificate of Incumbency replacing any Certificate of Incumbency
theretofore delivered to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be fully
protected in relying, without further inquiry, on the most recent Certificate
of Incumbency furnished to the Escrow Agent. Whenever this Escrow Agreement
provides for joint written notices, joint written instructions or other joint
actions to be delivered to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be fully
protected in relying, without further inquiry, on any joint written notice,
instructions or action executed by persons named in such Certificate of
Incumbency.

  



  

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT:

  



  

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When
a party opens an account, the Escrow Agent will ask for each party's name,
address, date of birth, or other appropriate information that will allow
the Escrow Agent to identify such party. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see
each party's driver's license or other identifying documents.

FORM OF WARRANT AGREEMENT

  



  

Dated as of [●], 2017

  



  

between

  



  

SEQUEL YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES, INC.

  



  

and

  



  

CONTINENTAL STOCK TRANSFER and TRUST COMPANY

  



  

THIS WARRANT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of [●], 2017, is by
and between Sequel Youth and Family Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New
York corporation, as warrant agent (the " _Warrant Agent_ ," also referred to
herein as the " _Transfer Agent_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company has entered into that certain Agreement and plan of
Merger dated as of January 11, 2017 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to
which the holders (the " _Legacy Equityholders_ ") of Class A Units and/or
Class B Units of Sequel Youth and Family Services, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (collectively, the " _Legacy Equity Units_ "), will receive
an aggregate of 6,532,000 warrants as consideration in exchange for such
persons' Legacy Equity Units simultaneously with the closing of the
transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement, bearing the legend set
forth in _Exhibit B_  hereto (the " _Warrants_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one
share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Common
Stock_ "), for $5.75 per half share, subject to adjustment as described
herein; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company desires the Warrant Agent to act on behalf of the
Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing to so act, in connection with the
issuance, registration, transfer, exchange, redemption and exercise of the
Warrants; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide for the form and provisions of the
Warrants, the terms upon which they shall be issued and exercised, and the
respective rights, limitation of rights, and immunities of the Company, the
Warrant Agent and the holders of the Warrants; and

  



  

WHEREAS, all acts and things have been done and performed which are necessary
to make the Warrants, when executed on behalf of the Company and
countersigned by or on behalf of the Warrant Agent, as provided herein, the
valid, binding and legal obligations of the Company, and to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

1.  _Appointment of Warrant Agent_. The Company hereby appoints the Warrant
Agent to act as agent for the Company for the Warrants, and the Warrant Agent
hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform the same in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.  _Warrants_.

  



  

2.1  _Effect of Countersignature_. If a physical certificate is issued,
unless and until countersigned by the Warrant Agent pursuant to this
Agreement, a Warrant shall be invalid and of no effect and may not be
exercised by the holder thereof.

  



  

2.2  _Warrants_. So long as the Warrants are held by a Legacy Equityholder or
any of their Permitted Transferees (as defined below), the Warrants: (i) may
be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, pursuant to _subsection
3.3.1(b)_ hereof, (ii) may not be transferred, assigned or sold until six (6)
months following the date hereof and (iii) shall not be redeemable by the
Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of (ii), the Warrants and
any shares of Common Stock held by any Legacy Equityholder and issued upon
exercise of the Warrants may be transferred by the holders thereof:

  



  

(a) in the case of an individual, by gift to such person's immediate family
or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of such person's
immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization,

  



  

(b) to the Company's officers or directors, any affiliate or family member of
any of the Company's officers or directors or any member of the Global
Partner Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Sponsor_
"), or any affiliate of the Sponsor or its members,

  



  

(c) in the case of an individual, by virtue of the laws of descent and
distribution upon death of such person,

  



  

(d) in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order,

  



  

(e) in the event of the Company's liquidation, or

  



  

(f) in the event that the Company consummates a merger, stock exchange or
other similar transaction that results in all of the holders of the Company's
equity securities having the right to exchange their shares of Common Stock
for cash, securities or other property; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the
case of clauses (a) through (d), these transferees (the "
_Permitted Transferees_ ") enter into a written agreement with the Company
agreeing to be bound by the transfer restrictions in this Agreement.

  



  

2.3  _Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1  _Warrant Register_. The Warrant Agent shall maintain books (the "
_Warrant Register_ "), for the registration of original issuance and the
registration of transfer of the Warrants. Upon the initial issuance of the
Warrants in book-entry form, the Warrant Agent shall issue and register the
Warrants in the names of the respective holders thereof in such
denominations and otherwise in accordance with instructions delivered to the
Warrant Agent by the Company.

  



  

Upon request, the Warrant Agent shall issue to holders of Warrants definitive
certificates in physical form evidencing such Warrants which shall be in the
form annexed hereto as Exhibit A.

  



  

   

 | -2-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The certificates, if issued, shall be signed by, or bear the facsimile
signature of, the Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or other principal officer of the Company.
In the event the person whose facsimile signature has been placed upon any
Warrant shall have ceased to serve in the capacity in which such person signed
the Warrant before such Warrant is issued, it may be issued with the same
effect as if he or she had not ceased to be such at the date of issuance.

  



  

2.3.2  _Registered Holder_. Prior to due presentment for registration of
transfer of any Warrant, the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat
the person in whose name such Warrant is registered in the Warrant Register
(the " _Registered Holder_ ") as the absolute owner of such Warrant and of
each Warrant represented thereby, for the purpose of any exercise thereof, and
for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary.

  



  

3.  _Terms and Exercise of Warrants_.

  



  

3.1  _Warrant Price_. Each Warrant shall, when countersigned by the Warrant
Agent, entitle the Registered Holder thereof, subject to the provisions of
such Warrant and of this Agreement, to purchase from the Company the number of
shares of Common Stock stated therein, at the price of $5.75 per half share,
subject to the adjustments provided in _Section 4_ hereof and in the
last sentence of this _Section 3.1_. The term " _Warrant Price_ " as used in
this Agreement shall mean the price per share at which shares of Common Stock
may be purchased at the time a Warrant is exercised. The Company in its sole
discretion may lower the Warrant Price at any time prior to the Expiration
Date (as defined below) for a period of not less than twenty (20) Business
Days, provided, that the Company shall provide at least twenty (20) days prior
written notice of such reduction to Registered Holders of the Warrants and,
provided further that any such reduction shall be identical among all of the
Warrants.

  



  

3.2  _Duration of Warrants_. A Warrant may be exercised only during the
period (the " _Exercise Period_ ") commencing on the date that is thirty (30)
days after the date hereof and terminating at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on
the date that is five (5) years after the date hereof (the " _Expiration
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise of any Warrant shall be
subject to the satisfaction of any applicable conditions, as set forth in
_subsection 3.3.2_ below, with respect to an effective registration
statement. The Company in its sole discretion may extend the duration of
the Warrants by delaying the Expiration Date; _provided_ , that the Company
shall provide at least twenty (20) days prior written notice of any such
extension to Registered Holders of the Warrants and, provided further that any
such extension shall be identical in duration among all the Warrants.

  



  

3.3  _Exercise of Warrants_.

  



  

3.3.1  _Payment_. Subject to the provisions of the Warrant and this
Agreement, a Warrant, when countersigned by the Warrant Agent, may be
exercised by the Registered Holder thereof by surrendering it, at the office
of the Warrant Agent, or at the office of its successor as Warrant Agent, in
the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, with the subscription
form, as set forth in the Warrant, duly executed, and by paying in full the
Warrant Price for each full share of Common Stock as to which the Warrant is
exercised and any and all applicable taxes due in connection with the exercise
of the Warrant, the exchange of the Warrant for the shares of Common Stock
and the issuance of such Common Stock, as follows:

  



  

(a) in lawful money of the United States, in good certified check or good
bank draft payable to the order of the Warrant Agent;

  



  

   

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) so long as a Warrant is held by a Legacy Equityholder or its Permitted
Transferee, by surrendering such Warrants for that number of shares of Common
Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number
of shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the
difference between the Warrant Price and the "Fair Market Value", as defined
in this  _subsection 3.3.1(b)_ , by (y) the Fair Market Value. Solely for
purposes of this _subsection 3.3.1(b)_ , the "Fair Market Value" shall mean
the average last sale price of the Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days
ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of exercise
of the Warrant is sent to the Warrant Agent; or

  



  

(c) as provided in _Section 7.4_ hereof.

  



  

3.3.2  _Issuance of Shares of Common Stock on Exercise_. As soon as
practicable after the exercise of any Warrant and the clearance of the funds
in payment of the Warrant Price (if payment is pursuant to _subsection
3.3.1(a))_ , the Company shall issue to the Registered Holder of such Warrant
a book-entry position or certificate, as applicable, for the number of full
shares of Common Stock to which he, she or it is entitled, registered in such
name or names as may be directed by him, her or it, and if such Warrant shall
not have been exercised in full, a new book-entry position or countersigned
Warrant, as applicable, for the number of shares as to which such Warrant
shall not have been exercised. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
exercise of a Warrant and shall have no obligation to settle such Warrant
exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with
respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants is then
effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the
Company's satisfying its obligations under _Section 7.4_. No Warrant shall be
exercisable and the Company shall not be obligated to issue shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of a Warrant unless the Common Stock issuable upon such
Warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under
the securities laws of the state of residence of the Registered Holder of the
Warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding
sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Warrant, the holder of such
Warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such Warrant and such Warrant may
have no value and expire worthless. Subject to _Section 4.6_ of
this Agreement, a Registered Holder of Warrants may exercise its Warrants
only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock (i.e., only an even number
of Warrants may be exercised at any given time by a Registered Holder). In no
event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Warrant exercise.

  



  

3.3.3  _Valid Issuance_. All shares of Common Stock issued upon the proper
exercise of a Warrant in conformity with this Agreement shall be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

  



  

3.3.4  _Date of Issuance_. Each person in whose name any book-entry position
or certificate, as applicable, for shares of Common Stock is issued shall for
all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares of
Common Stock on the date on which the Warrant, or book-entry position
representing such Warrant, was surrendered and payment of the Warrant Price
was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate in the
case of a certificated Warrant, except that, if the date of such surrender
and payment is a date when the share transfer books of the Company or book-
entry system of the Warrant Agent are closed, such person shall be deemed to
have become the holder of such shares at the close of business on the next
succeeding date on which the share transfer books or book-entry system are
open.

  



  

   

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.3.5  _Maximum Percentage_. A holder of a Warrant may notify the Company in
writing in the event it elects to be subject to the provisions contained in
this _subsection 3.3.5_ ; _however_ , no holder of a Warrant shall be subject
to this _subsection 3.3.5_ unless he, she or it makes such election. If the
election is made by a holder, the Warrant Agent shall not effect the exercise
of the holder's Warrant, and such holder shall not have the right to exercise
such Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such
person (together with such person's affiliates), to the Warrant
Agent's actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of [9.8%] (the "
_Maximum Percentage_ ") of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after giving effect to such exercise. For purposes of the foregoing sentence,
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such
person and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant with respect to which the
determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of
Common Stock that would be issuable upon (x) exercise of the remaining,
unexercised portion of the Warrant beneficially owned by such person and its
affiliates and (y) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such
person and its affiliates (including, without limitation, any
convertible notes or convertible preferred stock or warrants) subject to a
limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained
herein. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this
paragraph, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ "). For purposes of the Warrant, in determining the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the holder may rely on the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (1) the Company's most
recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, current
report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the Commission as the case may
be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (3) any other
notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the
written request of the holder of the Warrant, the Company shall, within two
(2) Business Days, confirm orally and in writing to such holder the number of
shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to
the conversion or exercise of equity securities of the Company by the holder
and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock was reported. By written notice to the Company, the
holder of a Warrant may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum
Percentage applicable to such holder to any other percentage specified in such
notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such increase shall not be
effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to
the Company.

  



  

4.  _Adjustments_.

  



  

4.1  _Stock Dividends_.

  



  

4.1.1  _Split-Ups_. If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions
of _Section 4.6_ below, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is
increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, or by a
split-up of shares of Common Stock or other similar event, then, on the
effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be
increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of Common
Stock. A rights offering to holders of the Common Stock entitling holders to
purchase shares of Common Stock at a price less than the "Fair Market Value"
(as defined below) shall be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity
securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or
exercisable for the Common Stock) multiplied by (ii) one (1) minus the
quotient of (x) the price per share of Common Stock paid in such rights
offering divided by (y) the Fair Market Value. For purposes of this
_subsection 4.1.1_ , (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible
into or exercisable for Common Stock, in determining the price payable for
Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received
for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or
conversion and (ii) " _Fair Market Value_ " means the volume weighted average
price of the Common Stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day
period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares
of Common Stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market,
regular way, without the right to receive such rights.

  



  

   

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.1.2  _Extraordinary Dividends_. If the Company, at any time while the
Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, shall pay a dividend or make a
distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the holders of the Common
Stock on account of such shares of Common Stock (or other shares of the
Company's capital stock into which the Warrants are convertible), other than
(a) as described in _subsection 4.1.1_ above, or (b) Ordinary Cash Dividends
(as defined below) (any such non-excluded event being referred to herein as
an " _Extraordinary Dividend_ "), then the Warrant Price shall be decreased,
effective immediately after the effective date of such Extraordinary
Dividend, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value (as determined
by the Board, in good faith) of any securities or other assets paid on each
share of Common Stock in respect of such Extraordinary Dividend. For purposes
of this _subsection 4.1.2_ , " _Ordinary Cash Dividends_ " means any cash
dividend or cash distribution which, when combined on a per share basis, with
the per share amounts of all other cash dividends and cash distributions paid
on the Common Stock during the 365-day period ending on the date of
declaration of such dividend or distribution (as adjusted to appropriately
reflect any of the events referred to in other subsections of this _Section 4_
and excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an
adjustment to the Warrant Price or to the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable on exercise of each Warrant) does not exceed $0.50.

  



  

4.2  _Aggregation of Shares_. If after the date hereof, and subject to the
provisions of _Section 4.6_ hereof, the number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split
or reclassification of shares of Common Stock or other similar event, then,
on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock
split, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be decreased in proportion
to such decrease in outstanding shares of Common Stock.

  



  

4.3  _Adjustments in Exercise Price_. Whenever the number of shares of Common
Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants is adjusted, as provided
in _subsection 4.1.1_ or _4.2_ above, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to
the nearest cent) by multiplying such Warrant Price immediately prior to such
adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants
immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock so purchasable immediately thereafter.

  



  

   

 | -6-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.4  _Replacement of Securities upon Reorganization, etc_. In case of any
reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
(other than a change under _subsections 4.1.1_ or _4.1.2_ or _Section 4.2_
hereof or that solely affects the par value of such shares of Common Stock),
or in the case of any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into
another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company
is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any
reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Common Stock),
or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of
the assets or other property of the Company as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety in connection with which the Company is
dissolved, the holders of the Warrants shall thereafter have the right to
purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions
specified in the Warrants and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock of the
Company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise
of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of stock or
other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such
reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a
dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the
Warrants would have received if such holder had exercised his, her or its
Warrant(s) immediately prior to such event (the " _Alternative Issuance_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the holders of the Common Stock were
entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of
securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger,
then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets constituting the
Alternative Issuance for which each Warrant shall become exercisable shall be
deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by
the holders of the Common Stock in such consolidation or merger that
affirmatively make such election, and (ii) if a tender, exchange or redemption
offer shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of the Common Stock
under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange
offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a
part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the
meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and any members of any such
group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, the holder of a Warrant shall be entitled
to receive as the Alternative Issuance, the highest amount of cash, securities
or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a
stockholder if such Warrant holder had exercised the Warrant prior to the
expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of
the Common Stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such
tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustments (from and after the
consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as
possible to the adjustments provided for in this _Section 4_ ; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that if less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the
holders of the Common Stock in the applicable event is payable in the form of
common stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national
securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market,
or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such
event, and if the Registered Holder properly exercises the Warrant within
thirty (30) days following the public disclosure of the consummation of such
applicable event by the Company pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed
with the SEC, the Warrant Price shall be reduced by an amount (in dollars)
equal to the difference of (i) the Warrant Price in effect prior to such
reduction minus (ii) (A) the Per Share Consideration (as defined below) (but
in no event less than zero) minus (B) the Black-Scholes Warrant Value (as
defined below). The " _Black-Scholes Warrant Value_ " means the value of a
Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of the applicable event based
on the Black-Scholes Warrant Model for a Capped American Call on Bloomberg
Financial Markets ("Bloomberg"). For purposes of calculating such amount, (1)
the price of each share of Common Stock shall be the volume weighted average
price of the Common Stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period
ending on the trading day prior to the effective date of the applicable
event, (2) the assumed volatility shall be the 90 day volatility obtained
from the HVT function on Bloomberg determined as of the trading day
immediately prior to the day of the announcement of the applicable event and
(3) the assumed risk-free interest rate shall correspond to the U.S. Treasury
rate for a period equal to the remaining term of the Warrant. " _Per Share
Consideration_ " means (i) if the consideration paid to holders of the
Common Stock consists exclusively of cash, the amount of such cash per share
of Common Stock, and (ii) in all other cases, the volume weighted average
price of the Common Stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period
ending on the trading day prior to the effective date of the applicable
event. If any reclassification or reorganization also results in a change in
shares of Common Stock covered by _subsection 4.1.1_ , then such adjustment
shall be made pursuant to _subsection 4.1.1_ or _Sections 4.2_ , _4.3_ and
this _Section 4.4_. The provisions of this _Section 4.4_ shall similarly apply
to successive reclassifications, reorganizations, mergers or consolidations,
sales or other transfers. In no event will the Warrant Price be reduced to
less than the par value per share issuable upon exercise of such Warrant.

  



  

   

 | -7-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.5  _Notices of Changes in Warrant_. Upon every adjustment of the Warrant
Price or the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant, the
Company shall give written notice thereof to the Warrant Agent, which notice
shall state the Warrant Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase
or decrease, if any, in the number of shares purchasable at such price upon
the exercise of a Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of
calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. Upon the
occurrence of any event specified in _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ or _4.4_ ,
the Company shall give written notice of the occurrence of such event to each
holder of a Warrant, at the last address set forth for such holder in
the Warrant Register, of the record date or the effective date of the event.
Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the
legality or validity of such event.

  



  

4.6  _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not issue fractional shares upon
the exercise of Warrants. If, by reason of any adjustment made pursuant to
this _Section 4_ , the holder of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the
exercise of such Warrant, to receive a fractional interest in a share,
the Company shall, upon such exercise, round down to the nearest whole number
the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to such holder.

  



  

4.7  _Form of Warrant_. The form of Warrant need not be changed because of
any adjustment pursuant to this _Section 4_ , and Warrants issued after such
adjustment may state the same Warrant Price and the same number of shares as
is stated in the Warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may at any time in its sole
discretion make any change in the form of Warrant that the Company may deem
appropriate and that does not affect the substance thereof, and any Warrant
thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution for an
outstanding Warrant or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.

  



  

4.8  _Other Events_. In case any event shall occur affecting the Company as
to which none of the provisions of preceding subsections of this _Section 4_
are strictly applicable, but which would require an adjustment to the terms of
the Warrants in order to (i) avoid an adverse impact on the Warrants and (ii)
effectuate the intent and purpose of this _Section 4_ , then, in each such
case, the Company shall appoint a firm of independent public accountants,
investment banking or other appraisal firm of recognized national standing,
which shall give its opinion as to whether or not any adjustment to the rights
represented by the Warrants is necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose
of this _Section 4_ and, if they determine that an adjustment is
necessary, the terms of such adjustment. The Company shall adjust the terms
of the Warrants in a manner that is consistent with any
adjustment recommended in such opinion.

  



  

5.  _Transfer and Exchange of Warrants_.

  



  

5.1  _Registration of Transfer_. The Warrant Agent shall register the
transfer, from time to time, of any outstanding Warrant upon the Warrant
Register, upon surrender of such Warrant for transfer, properly endorsed with
signatures properly guaranteed and accompanied by appropriate instructions
for transfer. Upon any such transfer, a new Warrant representing an equal
aggregate number of Warrants shall be issued and the old Warrant shall be
cancelled by the Warrant Agent. The Warrants so cancelled shall be delivered
by the Warrant Agent to the Company from time to time upon request.

  



  

5.2  _Procedure for Surrender of Warrants_. Warrants may be surrendered to
the Warrant Agent, together with a written request for exchange or transfer,
and thereupon the Warrant Agent shall issue in exchange therefor one or more
new Warrants as requested by the Registered Holder of the Warrants so
surrendered, representing an equal aggregate number of Warrants; _provided_
,  _however_ , that in the event that a Warrant surrendered for transfer
bears a restrictive legend, the Warrant Agent shall not cancel such Warrant
and issue new Warrants in exchange thereof until the Warrant Agent has
received an opinion of counsel for the Company stating that such transfer may
be made and indicating whether the new Warrants must also bear a restrictive
legend.

  



  

   

 | -8-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.3  _Fractional Warrants_. The Warrant Agent shall not be required to effect
any registration of transfer or exchange which shall result in the issuance
of a warrant certificate or book-entry position for a fraction of a warrant.

  



  

5.4  _Service Charges_. No service charge shall be made for any exchange or
registration of transfer of Warrants.

  



  

5.5  _Warrant Execution and Countersignature_. The Warrant Agent is hereby
authorized to countersign and to deliver, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Warrants required to be issued pursuant to the provisions
of this _Section 5_ , and the Company, whenever required by the Warrant
Agent, shall supply the Warrant Agent with Warrants duly executed on behalf of
the Company for such purpose.

  



  

6.  _[Reserved]_.

  



  

7.  _Other Provisions Relating to Rights of Holders of Warrants_.

  



  

7.1  _No Rights as Stockholder_. A Warrant does not entitle the Registered
Holder thereof to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company,
including, without limitation, the right to receive dividends, or other
distributions, exercise any preemptive rights to vote or to consent or to
receive notice as stockholders in respect of the meetings of stockholders or
the election of directors of the Company or any other matter.

  



  

7.2  _Lost, Stolen, Mutilated, or Destroyed Warrants_. If any Warrant is
lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Company and the Warrant Agent may
on such terms as to indemnity or otherwise as they may in their discretion
impose (which shall, in the case of a mutilated Warrant, include the
surrender thereof), issue a new Warrant of like denomination, tenor, and date
as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed. Any such new Warrant
shall constitute a substitute contractual obligation of the Company, whether
or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed Warrant shall be at
any time enforceable by anyone.

  



  

7.3  _Reservation of Common Stock_. The Company shall at all times reserve
and keep available a number of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock that shall be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all
outstanding Warrants issued pursuant to this Agreement.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

  

7.4  _Registration of Common Stock; Cashless Exercise at Company 's Option_.

  



   

7.4.1  _Registration of Common Stock._ The Company agrees that as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date hereof, it shall use its best efforts to file with the Commission a
registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. The Company shall use its best
efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus
relating thereto, until the expiration of the Warrants in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. If any such registration statement has not been
declared effective by the 60th Business Day following the date hereof,
holders of the Warrants shall have the right, during the period beginning on
the 61st Business Day after the date hereof and ending upon such registration
statement being declared effective by the Commission, and during any other
period when the Company shall fail to have maintained an effective
registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants, to exercise such Warrants on a "cashless basis," by
exchanging the Warrants (in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Act or another exemption) for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of
Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between
the Warrant Price and the "Fair Market Value" (as defined below) by (y) the
Fair Market Value. Solely for purposes of this _subsection 7.4.1_ , " _Fair
Market Value_ " shall mean the volume weighted average price of the Common
Stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading
day prior to the date that notice of exercise is received by the Warrant
Agent from the holder of such Warrants or its securities broker or
intermediary. The date that notice of cashless exercise is received by the
Warrant Agent shall be conclusively determined by the Warrant Agent. In
connection with the "cashless exercise" of a Warrant, the Company shall, upon
request, provide the Warrant Agent with an opinion of counsel for the Company
(which shall be an outside law firm with securities law experience) stating
that (i) the exercise of the Warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with
this _subsection 7.4.1_ is not required to be registered under the Securities
Act and (ii) the shares of Common Stock issued upon such exercise shall be
freely tradable under United States federal securities laws by anyone who is
not an affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act) of the Company and, accordingly, shall not be required to
bear a restrictive legend. Except as provided in _subsection 7.4.2_ , for the
avoidance of any doubt, unless and until all of the Warrants have been
exercised, the Company shall continue to be obligated to comply with its
registration obligations under the first three sentences of this _subsection
7.4.1_.

  



  

7.4.2  _Cashless Exercise at Company 's Option._ If the Common Stock is at
the time of any exercise of a Warrant not listed on a national securities
exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a "covered security" under
Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, (i)
require holders of Warrants who exercise Warrants to exercise such Warrants
on a "cashless basis" in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act
as described in _subsection 7.4.1_ and (ii) in the event the Company so
elects, the Company shall not be required to file or maintain in effect a
registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary. If the Company does not elect at the time
of exercise to require a holder of Warrants who exercises Warrants to
exercise such Warrants on a "cashless basis," it agrees to use its best
efforts to register or qualify for sale the Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrant under the blue sky laws of the state of residence
in those states in which the Warrants were initially offered by the Company
of the exercising Warrant holder to the extent an exemption is not available.

  



  

8.  _Concerning the Warrant Agent and Other Matters_.

  



  

8.1  _Payment of Taxes_. The Company shall from time to time promptly pay all
taxes and charges that may be imposed upon the Company or the Warrant Agent
in respect of the issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of the Warrants, but the Company shall not be obligated to pay any
transfer taxes in respect of the Warrants or such shares.

8.2  _Resignation, Consolidation, or Merger of Warrant Agent_.

  



  

8.2.1  _Appointment of Successor Warrant Agent_. The Warrant Agent, or any
successor to it hereafter appointed, may resign its duties and be discharged
from all further duties and liabilities hereunder after giving sixty (60)
days' notice in writing to the Company. If the office of the Warrant Agent
becomes vacant by resignation or incapacity to act or otherwise, the Company
shall appoint in writing a successor Warrant Agent in place of the Warrant
Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of
thirty (30) days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or
incapacity by the Warrant Agent or by the holder of a Warrant (who shall,
with such notice, submit his Warrant for inspection by the Company), then the
holder of any Warrant may apply to the Supreme Court of the State of New York
for the County of New York for the appointment of a successor Warrant Agent
at the Company's cost. Any successor Warrant Agent, whether appointed by the
Company or by such court, shall be a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of New York, in good standing and having its principal
office in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, and
authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to
supervision or examination by federal or state authority. After appointment,
any successor Warrant Agent shall be vested with all the authority, powers,
rights, immunities, duties, and obligations of its predecessor Warrant Agent
with like effect as if originally named as Warrant Agent hereunder, without
any further act or deed; but if for any reason it becomes necessary or
appropriate, the predecessor Warrant Agent shall execute and deliver, at the
expense of the Company, an instrument transferring to such successor Warrant
Agent all the authority, powers, and rights of such predecessor Warrant Agent
hereunder; and upon request of any successor Warrant Agent the Company shall
make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all instruments in writing
for more fully and effectually vesting in and confirming to such successor
Warrant Agent all such authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties, and
obligations.

  



  

8.2.2  _Notice of Successor Warrant Agent_. In the event a successor Warrant
Agent shall be appointed, the Company shall give notice thereof to the
predecessor Warrant Agent and the Transfer Agent for the Common Stock not
later than the effective date of any such appointment.

  



  

8.2.3  _Merger or Consolidation of Warrant Agent_. Any corporation into which
the Warrant Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated or any
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Warrant
Agent shall be a party shall be the successor Warrant Agent under this
Agreement without any further act.

  



  

8.3  _Fees and Expenses of Warrant Agent_.

  



  

8.3.1  _Remuneration_. The Company agrees to pay the Warrant Agent reasonable
remuneration for its services as such Warrant Agent hereunder and shall,
pursuant to its obligations under this Agreement, reimburse the Warrant Agent
upon demand for all expenditures that the Warrant Agent may reasonably incur
in the execution of its duties hereunder.

  



  

8.3.2  _Further Assurances_. The Company agrees to perform, execute,
acknowledge, and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged,
and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments, and assurances as
may reasonably be required by the Warrant Agent for the carrying out or
performing of the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

8.4  _Liability of Warrant Agent_.

  



  

8.4.1  _Reliance on Company Statement_. Whenever in the performance of its
duties under this Agreement, the Warrant Agent shall deem it necessary or
desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company
prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter
(unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed)
may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a statement signed
by the President, Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board of the
Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent may rely upon
such statement for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it pursuant
to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | -11-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.4.2  _Indemnity_. The Warrant Agent shall be liable hereunder only for its
own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Company agrees to
indemnify the Warrant Agent and save it harmless against any and all
liabilities, including judgments, costs and reasonable counsel fees, for
anything done or omitted by the Warrant Agent in the execution of this
Agreement, except as a result of the Warrant Agent's gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith.

  



  

8.4.3  _Exclusions_. The Warrant Agent shall have no responsibility with
respect to the validity of this Agreement or with respect to the validity or
execution of any Warrant (except its countersignature thereof). The Warrant
Agent shall not be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant
or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Warrant. The Warrant Agent
shall not be responsible to make any adjustments required under the
provisions of _Section 4_ hereof or responsible for the manner, method, or
amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts
that would require any such adjustment; nor shall it by any act hereunder be
deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or
reservation of any shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement or any Warrant or as to whether any shares of Common Stock
shall, when issued, be valid and fully paid and nonassessable.

  



  

8.5  _Acceptance of Agency_. The Warrant Agent hereby accepts the agency
established by this Agreement and agrees to perform the same upon the terms
and conditions herein set forth and among other things, shall account promptly
to the Company with respect to Warrants exercised and concurrently account
for, and pay to the Company, all monies received by the Warrant Agent for the
purchase of shares of Common Stock through the exercise of the Warrants.

  



  

8.6  _Waiver_. The Warrant Agent has no right of set-off or any other right,
title, interest or claim of any kind (" _Claim_ ") in, or to any distribution
of, the Trust Account (as defined in that certain Investment Management Trust
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Company and the
Warrant Agent as trustee thereunder) and hereby agrees not to seek
recourse, reimbursement, payment or satisfaction for any Claim against the
Trust Account for any reason whatsoever. The Warrant Agent hereby waives any
and all Claims against the Trust Account and any and all rights to seek access
to the Trust Account.

  



  

9.  _Miscellaneous Provisions_.

  



  

9.1  _Successors_. All the covenants and provisions of this Agreement by or
for the benefit of the Company or the Warrant Agent shall bind and inure to
the benefit of their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

9.2  _Notices_. Any notice, statement or demand authorized by this Agreement
to be given or made by the Warrant Agent or by the holder of any Warrant to
or on the Company shall be sufficiently given when so delivered if by hand or
overnight delivery or if sent by certified mail or private courier service
within five (5) days after deposit of such notice, postage prepaid,

9.3  _Applicable Law_. The validity, interpretation, and performance of this
Agreement and of the Warrants shall be governed in all respects by the laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles
that would result in the application of the substantive laws of another
jurisdiction. The Company hereby agrees that any action, proceeding or claim
against it arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be
brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and irrevocably
submits to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be exclusive. The
Company hereby waives any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that
such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

9.4  _Persons Having Rights under this Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to confer upon, or give to, any person or corporation
other than the parties hereto and the Registered Holders of the Warrants any
right, remedy, or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or of any

the interest of the Registered Holders. All other modifications or
amendments, including any amendment to increase the Warrant Price or shorten

Registered Holders of 65% of the then outstanding Warrants. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company may lower the Warrant Price or extend the duration
of the Exercise Period pursuant to _Sections 3.1_ and _3.2_ , respectively,
without the consent of the Registered Holders.

  



  

9.9  _Severability_. This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the

Warrant Certificate

  



  

 _This Warrant Certificate certifies that_ __________________, or registered
assigns, is the registered holder of warrant(s) (the " _Warrants_ " and each,
a " _Warrant_ ") to purchase shares of Common Stock, $.0001 par value ("
_Common Stock_ "), of Sequel Youth and Family Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "). Each Warrant entitles the holder, upon
exercise during the period set forth in the Warrant Agreement referred to
below, to receive from the Company that number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock as set forth below, at the exercise
price (the " _Exercise Price_ ") as determined pursuant to the Warrant
Agreement, payable in lawful money (or through " _cashless exercise_ " as
provided for in the Warrant Agreement) of the United States of America upon
surrender of this Warrant Certificate and payment of the Exercise Price at
the office or agency of the Warrant Agent referred to below, subject to the
conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement. Defined terms used
in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the Warrant Agreement.

  



  

Each Warrant is initially exercisable for one-half of one fully paid and non-
assessable share of Common Stock. The number of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

  



  

The initial Exercise Price per share of Common Stock for any Warrant is equal
to $5.75 per half share; provided however, that a Warrant may not be
exercised for a fractional share, so that only an even number of Warrants may
be exercised at a given time. The Exercise Price is subject to adjustment
upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

  



  

Subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement, the Warrants
may be exercised only during the Exercise Period and to the extent not
exercised by the end of such Exercise Period, such Warrants shall become void.

  



  

   

 | -15-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Warrant
Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof and such further provisions shall
for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.

  



  

This Warrant Certificate shall not be valid unless countersigned by the
Warrant Agent, as such term is used in the Warrant Agreement.

  



  

This Warrant Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts
of laws principles thereof.

[Form of Warrant Certificate]

  



  

[Reverse]

  



  

The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are part of a duly
authorized issue of Warrants entitling the holder on exercise to receive
shares of Common Stock and are issued or to be issued pursuant to a Warrant
Agreement dated as of [______], 2017 (the " _Warrant Agreement_ "), duly
executed and delivered by the Company to Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, a New York corporation, as warrant agent (the " _Warrant
Agent_ "), which Warrant Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference in and
made a part of this instrument and is hereby referred to for a description of
the rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and immunities
thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company and the holders (the words "
_holders_ " or " _holder_ " meaning the Registered Holders or Registered
Holder) of the Warrants. A copy of the Warrant Agreement may be obtained by
the holder hereof upon written request to the Company. Defined terms used in
this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the meanings given
to them in the Warrant Agreement.

  



  

Warrants may be exercised at any time during the Exercise Period set forth in
the Warrant Agreement. The holder of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant
Certificate may exercise them by surrendering this Warrant Certificate, with
the form of election to purchase set forth hereon properly completed and
executed, together with payment of the Exercise Price as specified in the
Warrant Agreement (or through " _cashless exercise_ " as provided for in the
Warrant Agreement) at the principal corporate trust office of the Warrant
Agent. In the event that upon any exercise of Warrants evidenced hereby the
number of Warrants exercised shall be less than the total number of Warrants
evidenced hereby, there shall be issued to the holder hereof or his, her or
its assignee, a new Warrant Certificate evidencing the number of Warrants not
exercised.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything else in this Warrant Certificate or the Warrant
Agreement, no Warrant may be exercised unless at the time of exercise (i) a
registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon
exercise is effective under the Securities Act and (ii) a prospectus
thereunder relating to the shares of Common Stock is current, except through "
_cashless exercise_ " as provided for in the Warrant Agreement.

  



  

The Warrant Agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants set
forth on the face hereof may, subject to certain conditions, be adjusted. If,
upon exercise of a Warrant, the holder thereof would be entitled to receive a
fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the Company shall, upon
exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of shares of Common Stock to
be issued to the holder of the Warrant.

  



  

Warrant Certificates, when surrendered at the principal corporate trust
office of the Warrant Agent by the Registered Holder thereof in person or by
legal representative or attorney duly authorized in writing, may be exchanged,
in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant
Agreement, but without payment of any service charge, for another Warrant
Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor evidencing in the aggregate
a like number of Warrants.

  



  

   

 | -17-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of this Warrant
Certificate at the office of the Warrant Agent a new Warrant Certificate or
Warrant Certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the aggregate a like
number of Warrants shall be issued to the transferee(s) in exchange for this
Warrant Certificate, subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant
Agreement, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge
imposed in connection therewith.

  



  

The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the Registered Holder(s)
hereof as the absolute owner(s) of this Warrant Certificate (notwithstanding
any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone), for the
purpose of any exercise hereof, of any distribution to the holder(s) hereof,
and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent
shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the Warrants nor
this Warrant Certificate entitles any holder hereof to any rights of
a stockholder of the Company.

  



  

Election to Purchase

  



  

(To Be Executed Upon Exercise of Warrant)

  



  

The undersigned hereby irrevocably elects to exercise the right, represented
by this Warrant Certificate, to receive shares of Common Stock and herewith
tenders payment for such shares to the order of Sequel Youth and Family
Services, Inc. (the " _Company_ ") in the amount of $______ in accordance
with the terms hereof. The undersigned requests that a certificate for such
shares be registered in the name of _________, whose address is and that such
shares be delivered to whose address is ______________________________. If
said number of shares is less than all of the shares of Common Stock
purchasable hereunder, the undersigned requests that a new Warrant
Certificate representing the remaining balance of such shares be registered in
the name of _________, whose address is ________________________, and that
such Warrant Certificate be delivered to , whose address is
_______________________.

  



  

In the event that the Warrant is to be exercised on a "cashless" basis
