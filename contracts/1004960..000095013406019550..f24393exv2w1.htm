promulgated thereunder or any applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect to which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.
