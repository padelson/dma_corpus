merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at

is referred to as the "Effective Time". 

   

 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time: 

   

 (a) the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read: "The name of the corporation is Connetics Corporation." 

  

 (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Legal Requirements; 

  

 (c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 1.5 Conversion of Shares, Options, and Warrants. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: 

   

 (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company in treasury or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

   

 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

   

 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to Section 1.5(b), each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of Company Options before the Effective Time), but 

   ##### 

  

    

excluding any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive
$17.50 in cash, without interest (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"); 

   

 (iv) each outstanding and unexercised Company Option shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement and all rights outstanding under the Company ESPP shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.3(b) of this Agreement; 

   

 (v) each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

The aggregate amount of cash consideration that each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock is entitled to receive for shares of Company Common
Stock held by such holder pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) shall be rounded
down to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating the cash amounts
payable for all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder. 

   

 (b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if the Company declares a stock dividend during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event occurs during such period, then the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for in Section 1.5(a)(iii), but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (but only after the value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 1.7, the total amount of cash consideration to which such holder would be entitled in respect thereof under Section 1.5(a) as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares (and all such cash shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have become deliverable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5(a)). The Company shall give Parent (i) reasonably prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required under the applicable provisions of the DGCL, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to 

   ##### 

  

    

settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, if the
Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of
such stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall
cease. 

  

 1.6 Payment Fund. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable national bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") to act as paying agent under this Agreement for the purpose of distributing the aggregate cash consideration distributable pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii) (the "Cash Consideration") upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with Section 1.7. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Cash Consideration (the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent will invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent. 

   

 1.7 Payment Procedures. 

   

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five days following the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates"): (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effective, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree before the Effective Time; and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for such holders applicable portion of the Cash Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent (or receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or any other evidence of transfer that the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of the transfer of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions to the transmittal letter, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the Certificate the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholding). 

  

 (b) No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Cash Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration shall be payable to such transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

  

 1.8 Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock who have not complied with the provisions of this Section 1 as of that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, and Parent shall, 

   ##### 

  

   

upon the request of any such former stockholder, promptly pay to such Persons
the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration to which he, she or it is
entitled. Any such portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Common Stock on the date that is five years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements) shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled to that portion of the Payment Fund. 

   

 1.9 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist (in exchange for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration or the right to receive consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(c)), and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such transfer books after the Effective Time. 

   

 1.10 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable portion of the Cash Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby only after the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed makes an affidavit to such effect and, if reasonably required, posts a bond in a reasonable amount and for a reasonable period of time as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate. 

   

 1.11 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Cash Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

   

 1.12 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation determine that any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

The Company shall promptly request that each Person who has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company in connection with such Persons consideration of an Acquisition Proposal (other than the parties hereto and their respective advisors) return or destroy all non-public 

   ##### 

  

 

information furnished to that Person by or on behalf of the Company. The
Company shall promptly inform its Representatives of the Companys
obligations under this Section 4.3. 

   

 (d) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provisions) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement. 

  

  Section 5\. Additional Covenants of the Parties  

  

 5.1 Company Proxy Statement. 

   

 (a) Promptly after the date of this Agreement (but in any event within 12 business days of the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that such 12 business day period shall be tolled during any period in which the Company has provided Parent with the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and Parent has not provided its comments, if any, to the Company within 24 hours of having received a draft of the Proxy Statement), the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC preliminary proxy materials to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote. Promptly following the later of (i) receipt and resolution of SEC comments thereon or (ii) the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company shall file definitive proxy materials with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. The Company will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities in connection with the Merger (or as required or appropriate to facilitate the Merger) to (x) comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable SEC requirements, and (y) otherwise comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Prior to filing the preliminary proxy materials, definitive proxy materials or any other filing with the SEC or any other Governmental Body, the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such filing in advance. 

  

 (b) The Company will notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff (or of notice of the SECs intent to review the Proxy Statement) and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any other filing or for additional/supplemental information, and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or other filing. The Company shall promptly respond to any comments from the SEC or its staff and use reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written response in advance. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any other filing, the Company shall promptly inform Parent of such occurrence, provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such amendment or supplement in advance, and shall cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or, to the extent required, mailing to the Companys stockholders, such amendment or supplement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 5.2 Company Stockholders Meeting. 

   

 (a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock to vote on the Required Company Stockholder Vote (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"). The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. The written consent of Parent will be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting in excess of 30 days; _provided, however_ , that in the event that there is present at such meeting, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company will not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting unless the Company is advised by counsel that failure to do so would result in a breach of applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of the Company recommends that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting (such recommendation being referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation"); and (ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude, (A) the Company from making any public disclosure of any material facts, including the fact that an Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal has been submitted to the Company, if the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after taking into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make such disclosure would conflict with its fiduciary duties or any Legal Requirement, or (B) the Companys board of directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that any disclosure with respect to an Acquisition Proposal other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to be a withdrawal, modification or amendment of the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent unless the board of directors of the Company (i) expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Merger or (ii) rejects such other Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time before this Agreement is adopted by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, if: (i) the Company shall have provided to Parent reasonably prompt notice before any meeting of the Companys board of directors at which the Companys board of directors will consider the possibility of withdrawing the Company Board Recommendation or modifying the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, together with reasonably detailed information regarding the circumstances giving rise to the consideration of such possibility; (ii) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and financial advisors: either (A) that the Company has received a Superior Offer not solicited in material violation of Section 4.3 that has not been withdrawn; or (B) that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would conflict with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under Legal Requirements, and (iii) prior to any such withdrawal, modification or amendment to the Company Board Recommendation in 

   ##### 

  

 

connection with such Superior Offer, (A) the Company shall have given Parent
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer, including the
identity of the party making such Superior Offer and, if available, a copy of
the relevant proposed transaction agreements with such party and other
related material documents, (B) the Company shall have given Parent five
business days after delivery of each such notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall have negotiated
in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other
proposal, if any, (C) Parent shall have failed within such five business day
period to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another
proposal) that are, in the good faith determination of the board of directors
of the Company, as least as favorable to the Company as the terms of such
Superior Offer and (D) the board of directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations
and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, and after
receiving the advice of outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the
failure to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation would
conflict with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however_ , that, in the event
the board of directors of the Company does not make the determination
referred to in clause (D) of this paragraph but thereafter determines to
withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation pursuant to this
Section 5.2(c), the procedures referred to in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D)
above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal,
amendment or modification of the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of any withdrawal of or modification to the
Company Board Recommendation. 

   

 (d) Prior to a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, making, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, or by any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation. 

  

 5.3 Stock Options and Company ESPP. 

   

 (a) Within five business days after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock, the Company will provide a notice to each holder of then outstanding Company Options which, if properly executed and returned to the Company prior to the Closing Date, will permit each holder of Company Options to exercise, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all or any portion of their outstanding Company Options, whether vested or unvested, contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, outstanding and unexercised as of immediately before the Effective Time with a per share exercise price less than the Per Share Merger Consideration (the "Exercised Options") (i) shall be automatically cancelled as of the Effective Time and, without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the difference between (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option, and (B) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option, and (ii) the Companys board of directors will take all necessary actions such that, at the Effective Time, each Exercised Option will, to the extent not vested, accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company Option, whether 

   ##### 

  

 

vested or unvested, outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time with a per share exercise price greater than or equal to the
Per Share Merger Consideration (the "Unexercised Options") shall be
automatically cancelled as of the Effective Time without any consideration
payable in respect thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
provide each holder of Company Options with a letter that conforms to the
applicable notice and exercise requirements of such holders Company Options
and sets forth the treatment of such holders Company Options as determined
by this Section 5.3(a). On the Closing Date, or soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter (but in no event later than five days
thereafter), the Company, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation shall pay over
to each holder of Exercised Options the aggregate cash consideration payable
to such holder of Exercised Options pursuant to this Section 5.3(a).
Such cash consideration shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and the
Company, Parent, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from such cash consideration such amounts as may be required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company,
Parent, or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Exercised Options in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Company, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. 

   

 (b) As of the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, the Company shall not permit (i) any participant in the Company ESPP to increase such participants payroll withholding with respect to the Company ESPP as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate amount withheld by the Company after the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time pursuant to the Company ESPP exceed $400,000, and (ii) any new participants to participate in the Company ESPP. Upon Parents request, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may be reasonably necessary to: (i) cause any outstanding offering period under the Company ESPP to be terminated as of the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective (the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "Designated Date"); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise as of the Designated Date of each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP; and (iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period shall commence under the Company ESPP after the Designated Date; _provided, however_ , that the actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iv)" of this sentence shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On the Designated Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP. 

  

 (c) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to cause all shares of Restricted Stock to become fully vested immediately prior the Effective Time. The 

   ##### 

  

 

Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all Company Option Plans
and all outstanding Company Options as of the Effective Time. 

   

 5.4 Employee Benefits. 

   

 (a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") will be eligible to participate in either, at the sole discretion of Parent: (i) Parents employee benefit plans and programs, including any equity incentive plan, pension plan, defined benefit plan, defined contribution plan, Section 401(k) plan, bonus plan, profit sharing plan, severance plan, medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan, time-off programs and disability plan, in each case to the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent; or (ii) such Company Employee Plans as are continued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, or are assumed by Parent (for the purposes of this Section 5.4 only, the plans referred to in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this sentence being referred to as "Specified Parent Benefit Plans"). 

  

 (b) Each Continuing Employee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, receive full credit for the years of continuous service by such Continuing Employee recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of (i) satisfying the service requirements for participation in each Specified Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) vesting in any benefits under such plans, and (iii) calculating the level of benefits with respect to severance, vacation, personal days off and any other welfare-type benefits where service is a factor in calculating benefits, except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained by Parent for the benefit of Continuing Employees located in the United States, subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements, Parent shall (to the extent that such limitation would not apply with respect to substantially similar plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), (A) cause to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations, and (B) give effect, in determining any deductible maximum out of pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such Continuing Employees during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. 

  

 (c) If requested by Parent at least five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably necessary pursuant to resolutions of the Companys board of directors necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to modify, amend, terminate, or 

   ##### 

  

 

establish employee benefit plans or arrangements, in whole or in part, at any
time after the Effective Time, except to the extent any such actions would
adversely effect the Continuing Employees as compared to the employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation). 

   

 5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed before, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by law and required by the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any indemnity agreements applicable to such Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this Agreement. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any indemnity agreements applicable to such Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

  

 (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, at no expense to the beneficiaries, either (i) maintain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (the "Current DandO Insurance") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Contemplated Transactions), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 225% of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 225%, the "Maximum Premium"), or (ii) purchase a six year extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a "Reporting Tail Endorsement") and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If the Companys existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and 

   ##### 

  

 

conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that Parent has not
purchased the Reporting Tail Endorsement (which Parent may not do without the
Companys prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) within thirty days of the date of this Agreement, the
Company may, prior to the Effective Time but only after consultation with
Parent, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that the Company does
not pay more than the Maximum Premium for such Reporting Tail Endorsement,
in which case, provided that Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to
maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its
full term, Parent shall be relieved from its obligations under the preceding
two sentences of this Section 5.5(c). 

   

 (d) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 5.5 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 5.5. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 5.5 are intended to be in addition to, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, enforce and honor, to the fullest extent permitted by law for a period of six years from the Effective Time, the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their Representatives. 

  

 5.6 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters. 

   

 (a) Each party shall use reasonable efforts to file, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file the notifications required under the HSR Act and under any other Legal Requirement that is designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition (collectively, "Antitrust Laws") required to consummate the Merger in connection with the Merger. The Company and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to: (i) any inquiries or requests (including any "second request" for information) received from the Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice ("FTC/DOJ") for additional information or documentation; and (ii) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters. 

  

 (b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each shall promptly supply the other parties with any information that may be required in order to effectuate any filings or applications pursuant to Section 5.6(a). Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall, (i) consult with the other party prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white 

   ##### 

  

 

papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of
the foregoing to any Governmental Body by or on behalf of any party to this
Agreement in connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection
with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, (iii) coordinate with
the other in preparing and exchanging such information, and (iv)
promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings,
presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made
by such party with any Governmental Body in connection with this Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions; _provided, however,_ with respect to any
such filing, presentation or submission, each of Parent and the Company need
not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or, in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any Legal Requirement applicable
to such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
access to any such information or to the extent required by any existing
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement. 

   

 (c) Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Body in connection with any filings made pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Body for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any applicable Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a), each party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Body such amendment or supplement. 

  

 (d) Parent and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; and (ii) shall use reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, including, but not limited to, (A) entering into negotiations with any applicable Governmental Body; (B) providing information required by law or governmental regulation; and (C) substantially complying with any "second request" for information pursuant to Antitrust Law. 

  

 (e) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violating any Antitrust Law, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable efforts to: (i) contest, resist or resolve any such proceeding or action; and (ii) to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any injunction resulting from such proceeding or action. Except as would reasonably be expected to be material to either Parent and its Subsidiaries (but excluding the Surviving Corporation) on the one hand, or the Company and its Subsidiaries on the other hand, Parent shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, 

   ##### 

  

 

any of the businesses, services or assets of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any Order issued pursuant to any Antitrust Law,
which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time
beyond the Outside Date. 

   

 5.7 Confidentiality; Disclosure. 

   

 (a) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously entered into the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement regarding the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions;  _provided, however,_ that Parent and the Company shall agree on the contents of the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.7, the obligations of Parent and the Company set forth in this Section 5.7 shall not apply with respect to any public statement relating to the withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.2(c). 

  

 5.8 Section 16 Matters. Provided that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable law) to cause any disposition of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Section 1 of this Agreement by each Company Insider (as defined below) to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. "Section 16 Information" means information regarding the Company Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for cash in connection with the Merger, and the number and description of the Company Options held by each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into cash in connection with the Merger. "Company Insiders" means those individuals who are subject to the reporting requirement of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company. 

   

 5.9 Convertible Notes. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide notice to the holders of the Notes of the proposed Merger and the rights of such holders under the indentures associated with such Notes in accordance with the terms of such indentures.

Section 2 of this Agreement shall be true and correct both when made and at

be so true and correct (giving effect to the applicable exceptions set forth
in the Company Disclosure Schedule but without giving effect to
any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" set
forth therein) does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 6.2 Performance of Covenants. All of the covenants and obligations in this Agreement that the Company is required to comply with or to perform at or prior to the Closing shall have been complied with and performed in all material respects.

their nature are only satisfied as of the Closing; provided, further, a party
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such
party at or prior to the Effective Time; 

    

 (c) by either Parent or the Company, duly authorized by the board of directors of Parent or the Company, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order, or shall have taken any other final and nonappealable action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;

 (g) by the Company upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue;  _provided, however_ if such inaccuracy in Parents or Merger Subs representations and warranties or breach by Parent or Merger Sub of a covenant or agreement is curable by Parent or Merger Sub within 45 days, then the Company may not 

   #####

In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect; _provided, however,_ that: (i) this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 8.4, and Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, and (iii) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for any intentional and material breach of any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.

Transaction is with the Person who made the Acquisition Proposal publicly
announced at the time of such termination, (III) in its entirety
simultaneously with the entry by the Company into a binding definitive
agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, the Acquisition
Transaction referenced in clause (c) above, as applicable, in the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b), provided such Acquisition Transaction
is with the Person who made the Acquisition Proposal publicly announced at the
time of such termination, (IV) one-half upon the entry by the Company into a

simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement in the event of a
termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h). 

   

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent under the provisions referred to in clause (c) of Section 8.4(a) (or is terminated under another provision of this Agreement but could have been terminated under such clause), then the Company shall pay to Parent, as promptly as possible following receipt of an invoice from Parent (but in any event within two business days following such receipt), in accordance with Parents written instructions, Parents actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, or consultants and commitment fees) actually incurred by Parent and its respective Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the Contemplated Transactions ("Parent Expenses"), which amount shall not be greater than $3,000,000; _provided, however_ , that the existence of circumstances which could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to clause (c) of Section 8.4(a) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.4(b); and _provided, further,_ that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to clause (c) of Section 8.4(a). 

   

 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.4 are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions, that without these agreements Parent would not have entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.4 do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay Parent any amounts due to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.4 within the time periods specified in this Section 8.4, the Company shall pay interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.

doubt, in no event shall the liability of the Company pursuant to this Section
8.4 exceed $19,100,000 plus the amount of any interest accrued pursuant to
this Section 8.4(c).
