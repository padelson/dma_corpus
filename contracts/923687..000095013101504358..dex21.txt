          purposes hereof, "Pre-Closing Tax Period" means a taxable period of
                            ----------------------
          the Company or any Company Subsidiary ending on and including the

          Company Subsidiaries.

               (b) All material federal, state, local and foreign income,
          corporation and other Tax Returns have been, or the Company shall

          of Taxes have been, or the Company shall cause such filings to be,
          duly and timely made for the Company and each Company Subsidiary, for

          such material Taxes to be, duly and timely paid. Each such Tax Return
          and filing is true, correct and complete in all material respects and

               assessment of any additional Taxes by any Governmental Authority
               with respect to the taxable years covered in such Tax Returns and

               parent corporation, prior to its inclusion in the Parent Group.
               Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability
               for the Taxes of any other Person under Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-6

               not filed Tax Returns that the Company or such Company Subsidiary
               is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                    (f) No power of attorney that is currently in force has been
               granted with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
               with respect to any matters relating to Taxes. No tax sharing,
               indemnity, allocation or similar agreement requiring the Company
               or any of its Subsidiaries to make payments to any Person exists

                                    ARTICLE V

connection with any audit or any other reasonable business purpose relating to
the assets or liabilities of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries; provided that any such
access by Lodging shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
Purchaser's business. The provisions of this Section 5.2 shall survive the

regulatory agency or with any national securities exchange or automated
quotation system with respect thereto.

     5.5  Tax Covenants.
          -------------

          (a)  The parties acknowledge that the Merger and each of the Merging
       Subsidiary Mergers will be treated for federal, state and local income or
       franchise tax purposes as a taxable sale of assets by the Company or the
       Merging Subsidiary, as the case may be, to Purchaser, followed
       immediately by a deemed liquidation of the transferor, in the order
       prescribed in this Agreement, and agree to report the Merger and each
       Subsidiary Merger consistently with such characterization for income
       or franchise tax purposes. Income, gains, losses or deductions
       attributable to such asset sales will be included in the Pre-Closing
       Tax Period.

          (b)  Purchaser shall (i) continue as an entity taxable as a
        partnership, and (ii) shall not transfer more than an insubstantial
        portion of the assets acquired in the Merger or any one of the Merging
        Subsidiary Mergers to any Affiliate of Purchaser taxable as a
        corporation (or to a partnership or disregarded entity owned by an
        Affiliate of Purchaser taxable as a corporation), in each case, during
        the period that expires upon the earlier of (i) the date which is 9
        months after the Closing and (ii) the date of any change in control of
        Purchaser. A "change of control" for purposes of this provision and
        Section 4.8 means a transfer to an unaffiliated party of more than 51
        -----------
        percent of voting power and more than 51 percent of the equity value of
        Purchaser. Purchaser shall, until the earlier to occur of (i) the 12
        month anniversary of the Closing or (ii) the sale or other disposition
        to a Person which is not an Affiliate of Purchaser of all of its
        interest in Homestead Management or HVI(2), as applicable, cause each of
        Homestead Management and HVI(2) to be treated as a single member limited
        liability company disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for
        federal income tax purposes.

          (c)  Any Tax sharing, indemnity, allocation or other similar agreement
        currently in effect among the Parent Group and the Company or any of the
        Company Subsidiaries shall terminate effective immediately prior to the
        Closing Date and there shall be no further liability of the Company, the
        Company Subsidiaries (or any successors of them) or Lodging, Parent, or
        the Parent Group, or any Affiliate of any of them, under any such
        agreements.

          (d)  Lodging shall prepare and duly file (in a manner consistent with
        past practice) all required Tax Returns for the Company and the Company
        Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including, without
        limitation, for those jurisdictions and Tax authorities that permit or
        require a short period Tax Return, for the period ending on the Closing
        Date. Lodging has either paid, or shall pay or cause to be paid (or with
        respect to sales, occupancy and property Taxes referenced in Schedule
                                                                     --------
        1.1(g) (excluding sales taxes which are Transaction Taxes), has provided
        ------
        or shall provide adequate accruals, which accruals are reflected as a
        line item in the calculation of Net Tangible Liability for purposes of
        determining the Merger Consideration), all Taxes accruing with respect
        to the operations of, or imposed on, the Company or any

                                       46

<PAGE>

          Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser or an
          Affiliate of Purchaser shall prepare and duly file, or cause the
          Company Subsidiaries or their successors to prepare and duly file, all
          required Tax Returns for the business and operations of the Company,
          the Company Subsidiaries or their respective successors for all
          periods ending after the Closing Date, provided that with respect to
          any Tax Return for a Straddle Period (as defined below), Purchaser
          shall prepare the Tax Return consistent with past practice. Purchaser
          shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes that accrue with respect to
          the operations of, or imposed on, the Company, the Company
          Subsidiaries or their respective successors for such periods. With
          respect to any taxable period commencing before the Closing Date and
          ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), Lodging shall
                                            ---------------
          pay, or cause to be paid (or with respect to sales, occupancy or
          property Taxes referenced in Schedule 1.1(g) (excluding sales taxes
                                       ---------------
          which are Transaction Taxes), has provided or shall provide adequate
          accruals, which accruals are reflected as a line item in the
          calculation of Net Tangible Liability for purposes of determining the
          Merger Consideration), to the Company or the relevant Company
          Subsidiary, or successors of either, as the case may be, all Taxes of
          the Company and the Company Subsidiaries attributable to the portion
          of the Straddle Period prior to and including the Closing Date. For
          purposes of this Agreement, the portion of any Tax that is
          attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period prior to and
          including the Closing Date, shall be (i) in the case of a Tax that is
          not based on net income, gross income, premiums or gross receipts
          (including, but not limited to, a property Tax), the total amount of
          such Tax for the period in question multiplied by a fraction, the
          numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period prior
          to and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the
          total number of days in such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of
          a Tax that is based on net income, gross income, premiums or gross
          receipts, the Tax that would be due with respect to the portion of the
          Straddle Period prior to and including the Closing Date if such
          portion were a separate taxable period, except that exemptions,
          allowances, deductions or credits that are calculated on an annual
          basis (such as the deduction for depreciation or capital allowances)
          shall be apportioned on a per diem basis. Any Taxes, penalties or
          interest imposed upon, or attributable to the operations of, the
          Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their successors payable as a
          result of an audit of any Tax Return shall be deemed to have accrued
          in the period to which such Taxes, penalties or interest are
          attributable.

               (e) Purchaser, Parent and Lodging shall cooperate fully and shall
          cause their respective Affiliates and representatives to cooperate
          with each other in connection with (i) the preparation and filing of
          any Tax Returns with respect to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
          or their successors and (ii) any audit or other examination by any
          Governmental Authority of the Tax Returns referred to in clause (i).
          Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, the furnishing or
          making available of records, books of account or other materials of
          the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their successors necessary or
          helpful for the defense against assertions of any Governmental
          Authority as to any Tax Returns which include the business and
          operations of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their
          successors. Whenever any Governmental Authority asserts a claim, makes
          an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for a
          Pre-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser or its Affiliates

                                       47

<PAGE>

          shall, if informed in writing of such an assertion, inform
          Lodging as soon as reasonably practical, but in any event within 15
          Business Days of being so informed, and Lodging shall have the right
          to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when
          to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such
          proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which
          Lodging is or may be liable under this Agreement; provided, however,
          that failure to inform Lodging in accordance with this provision shall
          not affect Purchaser's right to indemnification hereunder unless, and
          to the extent that, such failure materially impairs the ability of
          Lodging to defend against such assertion; and provided, further,
          however, that Purchaser shall have the right to consent, which consent
          shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to any settlement to
          the extent such proceedings or settlement could materially affect the
          amount of Taxes imposed on the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
          successor for any Straddle Period or any period beginning after the
          Closing. Whenever any Governmental Authority asserts a claim, makes an
          assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for a Straddle
          Period or period beginning after the Closing, Purchaser shall have the
          right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether
          and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute; provided,

     Merger Consideration adjustments shall be made as of the Closing Date as

                  ------------

     8.1  Determination of Net Tangible Liability. Lodging and Purchaser have
          ---------------------------------------
prepared a schedule (the "Closing Schedule") in accordance with Schedule 1.1(g),
                          ----------------                      ---------------
setting forth their mutual good faith estimate of the Net Tangible Liability as
of the Closing. Lodging has delivered a copy thereof to Purchaser and has
provided to Purchaser a detailed listing of all assets and liabilities reflected
thereon. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide to
Lodging a revised Closing Schedule (the "Revised Closing Schedule") setting
                                         ------------------------
forth its revised calculation of Net Tangible Liability as of the Closing, and

Closing Schedule (or a statement that Purchaser proposes no such changes). In
the event Purchaser proposes changes to the Closing Schedule, Purchaser shall

                                       52

<PAGE>

the parties cannot agree in good faith to the calculation of Net Tangible
Liability set forth in the Revised Closing Schedule (or otherwise proposed by
Lodging in the event Purchaser proposes no changes to such Schedule) within 30
days after delivery by Purchaser of the Revised Closing Schedule, the items not
agreed to shall be so determined by a nationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants mutually agreed upon by the parties. Each party shall submit
to the accounting firm the dollar amount of its proposed adjustment, if any, to
Net Tangible Liability as reflected on the Closing Schedule, and the fees and
expenses of such firm shall be paid by the party whose proposed final adjustment
is furthest in dollar amount from the final determination of the accounting
firm. In the event that, as finally determined, Net Tangible Liability is
greater than the Net Tangible Liability set forth on the Closing Schedule,
Lodging shall make a prompt payment in cash to Purchaser in the amount of such
difference. For purposes of determining Net Tangible Liability, any receivable
which is more than 60 days past due shall be deemed uncollectible and shall not
be included in the calculation of Net Tangible Liability; provided that
Purchaser shall not act to compromise, discount or otherwise impair the
collectibility of any such receivable and, provided further, that Purchaser
shall have no affirmative obligation to collect any such receivable. Purchaser
shall promptly remit to Lodging any such receivable actually collected. Any
receivable used in the calculation of Net Tangible Liability which becomes more
than 60 days past due may be assigned by Purchaser to Lodging at Purchaser's
option, in which case Lodging shall immediately remit to Purchaser the full
amount of such assigned receivable. For purposes of calculating the Net Tangible
Liability, (i) the liability of the HPT Lease shall be deemed to be $134,600,000
without further adjustment or modification, (ii) any security deposit under the
HPT Lease shall be excluded as an asset (except that the HPT FF&E Reserve shall
be included as an asset) and (iii) liabilities set forth on Schedule 1.1(g)
                                                            ---------------
shall be calculated consistent with the most recent Financial Statements.

    10.4  Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense. The Indemnified
          ---------------------------------------------------
Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the
Indemnifying Person (and, if the Indemnified Person is a Purchaser Indemnified
Party and the Escrow continues to be held by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent)
of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto in respect of which indemnity may
be sought under this Agreement; provided that the failure of the Indemnified
Person to give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
indemnification obligations under this Agreement except to the extent (if any)
that the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense, (a) participate in the defense of
any claim, suit, action or proceeding and (b) upon notice to the Indemnified
Person and the Indemnifying Person's delivering to the Indemnified Person a
written agreement that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
hereunder for all Losses arising out of such claim, suit, action or proceeding
and that the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the entire amount of any
Loss, at any time during the course of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding, assume the defense thereof; provided, however, that (i) the
Indemnifying Person's counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person, and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall thereafter consult with the
Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified Person's reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such claim, suit, action or
proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Person shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ

                                       58

<PAGE>

counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Person. If, however, the Indemnified Person reasonably determines
in its judgment that representation by the Indemnifying Person's counsel of both
the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest, then such Indemnified Person may employ separate
counsel to represent or defend it in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding
and the Indemnifying Person shall pay the fees and disbursements of such
separate counsel. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or
prosecute any such claim, suit, action or proceeding, all of the parties hereto
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.

         10.5   Settlement or Compromise. Any settlement or compromise made or
                ------------------------
caused to be made by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person, as the
case may be, of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred
to in Section 10.4 shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Person or the
      ------------
Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final
judgment or decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
amount of such settlement or compromise; provided, however, that no obligation,
restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of
such settlement without its prior written consent. The Indemnified Person shall
give the Indemnifying Person at least 30 days' notice of any proposed settlement
or compromise of any claim, suit, action or proceeding it is defending, during
which time the Indemnifying Person may reject such proposed settlement or
compromise; provided, however, that from and after such rejection, the
Indemnifying Person shall be obligated to assume the defense of and full and
complete liability and responsibility for such claim, suit, action or proceeding
and any and all Losses in connection therewith in excess of the amount of
unindemnifiable Losses which the Indemnified Person would have been obligated to
pay under the proposed settlement or compromise.

         10.6   Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act. In the event that the
                -------------------------------------
Indemnifying Person does not elect to assume the defense of any claim, suit,
action or proceeding, then any failure of the Indemnified Person to defend or to
participate in the defense of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding or to
cause the same to be done, shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations hereunder.

         10.7   Indemnity Payments. The amount of any indemnity payable under
                ------------------
the terms of this Article X or Section 5.5 shall be treated by Purchaser,
                  ---------    -----------
Lodging and the Company as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration, and shall
be calculated after giving effect to any proceeds received from insurance
policies covering the damage, loss, liability or expense that is the subject of
the claim for indemnity to the extent that the premiums for such coverage were
paid by the Indemnifying Person or any of its Affiliates.

         10.8   Limitation on Liability. Following the Closing, Lodging's
                -----------------------
liability for breach of any covenant, obligation, including indemnification,
representation or warranty shall be limited to claims (excluding (i) Taxes for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods as provided in Section 5.5 or any
                                                            -----------

limitations shall apply to Lodging's obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for (i) Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle
Periods as provided in Section 5.5 or any claims relating to Tax matters which
                       -----------
are the subject matter of Section 5.5, (ii) employee claims as provided in

         11.4   Waivers. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to
                -------
require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right
at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or more
instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition or
breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

         11.5   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
                ------------

masculine, feminine or neuter gender herein shall

                                       62

<PAGE>

not limit any provision of this Agreement. The use of the terms "including" or
"include" shall in all cases herein mean "including, without limitation" or
"include, without limitation," respectively. Underscored references to Articles,
Sections, Subsections or Schedules shall refer to those portions of this
Agreement. Consummation of the transactions contemplated herein shall not be
deemed a waiver of a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or
covenant or of any party's rights and remedies with regard thereto. No specific
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall limit the generality
or applicability of a more general representation, warranty or covenant
contained herein. A breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or
covenant shall not be affected by the fact that any more general or less general
representation, warranty or covenant was not also breached or inaccurate.

         11.7   Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
                --------------
construed and enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New

         11.8   Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the
                ----------
prior written consent of the other, and any such prohibited assignment shall be
void. The foregoing notwithstanding, Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any
Affiliate of Purchaser or any lender to Purchaser or its Affiliates; provided
that any such successor assumes in writing and agrees to bound by the provisions
of this Agreement and the assignment does not require any consent or approval
under, or additional assignment or assumption of, the HPT Agreements. No
assignment shall relieve the assignor of any liability hereunder. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
respective legal representatives, successors, assigns, heirs, and devisees of
the parties.

         11.9   No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for the
                ----------------------------
benefit of the parties hereto, and no provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to confer upon other third parties any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

         11.10  Calculation of Time Periods. Unless otherwise specified, in
                ---------------------------
computing any period of time described herein, the day of the act or event after
which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included and the
last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless such last day is a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday for national banks in New York, in which event
the period shall run until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday,
Sunday or legal holiday. The last day of any period of time described herein
shall be deemed to end at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time.

         11.11  Further Assurances. Upon the reasonable request of Purchaser,
                ------------------
Lodging shall, on and after the Closing Date, execute and deliver to Purchaser
such other documents, releases, assignments and other instruments as may be
required to effectuate completely the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

         11.12  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
                ------------
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of
the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall be
deemed substituted for the provision at

                                       63

<PAGE>

issue a valid, legal and enforceable provision as similar as possible to the
provision at issue.

         11.13  Entire Understanding.  This Agreement embodies the entire
                --------------------
agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements
and understandings relating among the parties.

         11.14  Construction. The parties acknowledge that the parties and their
                ------------
counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal rule of
construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the
drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or
any exhibits or amendments hereto.
