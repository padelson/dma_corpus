Index - ii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this " _Agreement_
"), dated April 7, 2008, by and among KINETIC CONCEPTS, INC., a Texas
corporation (" _Parent_ "), LEOPARD ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Purchaser_ "), and
LIFECELL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser make a cash tender offer (such tender
offer, as it may be amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted by
this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "
_Shares_ ") other than shares of Restricted Stock (which shall be purchased in
accordance with _Section 2.4_ below) for $51.00 per Share, net to the sellers
in cash (such price, or any such higher price per Share as may be paid in the
Offer, is referred to herein as the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any
required withholding of Taxes;

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser
shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which
each outstanding Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, without interest, except for (i) Shares held by holders who comply with
the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") regarding the right of stockholders to require
appraisal of their Shares and (ii) Shares held in the treasury of the Company
or owned by Parent, Purchaser or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") (i) has approved this Agreement, (ii) has determined that the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) is recommending
that the holders of the Shares (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") accept the
Offer, tender their Shares into the Offer and adopt this Agreement, in each
case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; and 

WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Parent and Purchaser has (i)
approved this Agreement and (ii) has determined that the Offer, the Merger
and Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of their
respective corporations.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ and none of the events or
conditions set forth in     _Annex I_ hereto shall have occurred and be continuing and not have been
waived by Parent or Purchaser, as promptly as reasonably practicable and,
in any event, within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement,
the Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the U.S.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for
cash all Shares at the Offer Price. The obligations of the Purchaser to accept
for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered on or prior to the
expiration of the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject to (i) there being
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that
number of Shares which represents a majority of the Shares outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the other
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto. Subject to the prior satisfaction or
waiver by Parent or the Purchaser of the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions of the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ hereto, the Purchaser shall,
in accordance with the terms of the Offer, consummate the Offer and accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer promptly after expiration of the Offer, which shall initially be
the 20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) if on the initial expiration date of the Offer or on any
subsequent scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as extended in accordance
with this Agreement), all conditions to the Offer shall not have been
satisfied or waived, the Purchaser may, from time to time, in its sole
discretion, extend the Offer for such period as the Purchaser may determine;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if on the initial expiration date of the Offer
the conditions to the Offer set forth in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of _Annex
I_ hereto shall each be satisfied (or, in the case of paragraphs (d) and (e),
if any such breach or failure to comply that has caused such non-satisfaction
of the condition is objectively curable within ten (10) Business Days) but any
other condition to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived,
Purchaser shall be obligated to extend the Offer for one or more periods of
time of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or such longer period as Purchaser
may agree in writing) until such conditions have been satisfied or waived; 
_provided_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond
the date that is thirty (30) Business Days following the initial expiration of
the Offer; (y) the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position
of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; and (z) the Purchaser
may, in its sole discretion, provide a "subsequent offering period" for
three (3) to twenty (20) Business Days to acquire outstanding untendered
Shares in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act if the Minimum
Condition and all of the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto are
satisfied or waived, but the number of Shares that have been validly tendered
and not withdrawn in the Offer and accepted for payment, together with any
Shares then owned by Parent, is less than 90% of the outstanding Shares.
Purchaser shall not extend the Offer following the termination of this
Agreement. In addition, the Purchaser may increase the Offer Price and extend
the Offer to the extent required by Law in connection with such increase, in
each case in its sole discretion and without the Companys consent, but
Purchaser and Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, (A) decrease the Offer Price (as it may have been increased
hereunder) or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (B)
decrease the number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer, (C) amend or waive
the Minimum Condition, (D) add to the conditions to the Offer set forth in
_Annex I_ hereto or modify such conditions in a manner adverse to the holders
of Shares, (E) extend the Offer, except as permitted by this _Section 1.1(a)_
or (F) make any other change in the terms or conditions of the Offer that is
adverse to the holders of Shares. The Offer may not be terminated prior to
its expiration date (as  



 

2  such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with 
_Article VIII_. If Purchaser shall commence a subsequent offering period in
connection with the Offer, Purchaser shall accept for payment and pay for all
Shares validly tendered during such subsequent offering period.

(b) On the date the Offer is commenced, Purchaser shall file with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall include the
offer to purchase, form of the letter of transmittal and form of notice of
guaranteed delivery (collectively, together with any amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Subject to the Companys
compliance with _Section 1.2(b)_, Parent and the Purchaser shall cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as required by
applicable U.S. federal securities laws. Each of Parent and the Purchaser, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required
by Law. The Purchaser further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares as required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information
concerning the Company that is required or reasonably requested by Parent or
Purchaser in connection with the obligations relating to the Offer Documents
contained in this _Section 1.1(b)_. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC and Parent and the Purchaser shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the
Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and the Purchaser agree to
provide the Company and its counsel with any comments or communications that
Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after Parents
or the Purchasers, as the case may be, receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto, and shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and
Purchaser to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which
reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating with Parent and the Purchaser or their counsel in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC.

Section 1.2  _Company Actions_. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer, and represents and warrants that the Company Board of
Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) approved
this Agreement, and deemed this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
Transactions advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company
Stockholders; (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, in all respects, and, subject to the
accuracy of the representation set forth in _Section 4.6(b)_ of this
Agreement, such approval constitutes approval of the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement and the Transactions for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL; and
(iii) subject to _Section 5.2(e)_, resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders accept the Offer, that the Company Stockholders tender their
Shares in the Offer to Purchaser, and that the Company Stockholders adopt
this Agreement to the extent required by applicable Law (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "). The Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents, subject to  _Section 5.2(e)_. To the
knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement all of the
Companys directors and executive officers intend to tender all Shares
beneficially owned by them to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. 



 

3 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable on the day the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange
Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") which shall, subject to the provisions of
_Section 5.2(e)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and, subject to
the Purchasers compliance with  _Section 1.1(a)_, disseminated to holders
of Shares as required by and in accordance with applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser,
on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. The Company agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares as required by
and in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws. Parent and the
Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and the Purchaser that is required or reasonably requested by the
Company in connection with the obligations relating to Schedule 14D-9
contained in this _Section 1.2(b)_. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel
shall be given the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company agrees to provide
Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel in writing with any comments or
communications that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the Companys receipt of such comments, and any oral or written responses
thereto and shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response of the Company to those comments
and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given), including by participating with the Company or
its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish (or cause
its transfer agent to furnish) to the Purchaser mailing labels,

containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of a
recent date, and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with such information
and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the
Shares, updated periodically, and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of
security positions) as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request.
Except as required by applicable Law, and except as necessary to communicate
regarding the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions with the Company
Stockholders, Parent and Purchaser (and their respective Representatives)
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information solely in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the Transactions, and, if this Agreement is terminated
or the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Company or destroy all copies of such information, labels,
listings and files then in their possession or in the possession of their
Representatives.



 

4 Section 1.3 _Directors_. Promptly upon the acceptance for payment of any
Shares by Parent or the Purchaser or any of their affiliates pursuant to the
Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled, subject to _Section 1.3(b)_, to elect or designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board of Directors as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of
directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors
elected or designated by Parent pursuant to this _Section 1.3_) multiplied
by (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by the Purchaser, Parent and any of their affiliates by the
total number of Shares then outstanding (on a fully-diluted basis). The
Company shall, upon Parents request, either use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly increase the size of the Company Board of Directors, or use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly secure the resignations of such number of
its incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Parents designees
to be so elected or designated to the Companys Board of Directors, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to cause
Parents designees to be so elected or designated at such time. At such time,
the Company shall, upon Parents request, also use its reasonable best efforts
to cause persons elected or designated by Parent to constitute the
same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company
Board of Directors of each committee of the Company Board of Directors,
subject to appropriate qualification. The Companys obligations under this
_Section 1.3_ shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this  _Section 1.3_, including, but not limited to,
mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) such information as
is required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to enable Parents designees
to be elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors. Parent or the
Purchaser shall supply the Company with the information and consents with
respect to either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(b) In the event that Parents designees are elected or designated to the
Board of Directors of the Company, then, until the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to have at least
three (3) directors who are (i) directors on the date of this Agreement, (ii)
independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of
the Nasdaq Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") and (iii) reasonably satisfactory to
Parent (such directors, the " _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if any Independent Director is unable to serve due to death
or disability or any other reason (including as a result of removal for cause
pursuant to the last sentence of this _Section 1.3(b)_), the remaining
Independent Directors (or Independent Director) shall be entitled to elect or
designate another individual (or individuals) who serve(s) as a director (or
directors) on the date of this Agreement (provided that no such individual is
an employee of the Company) to fill the vacancy, and such director (or
directors) shall be deemed to be an Independent Director (or Independent
Directors) for purposes of this Agreement. If no Independent Director remains
prior to the Effective Time, a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company at the time of the execution of this Agreement shall
be entitled to designate three persons to fill such vacancies; _provided_ that
such individuals shall not be employees or officers of the Company, Parent
or the Purchaser and shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and such
persons shall be deemed Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.
Following the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Purchaser shall not cause any amendment or termination of this Agreement, any
extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts  



 

5  of Purchaser or Parent or waiver of any of the Companys rights under this
Agreement or other action adversely affecting the rights of the
Company Stockholders (other than Parent or the Purchaser), to be effected
without the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors.
Following the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent
nor Purchaser shall take any action to remove any Independent Director unless
the removal shall be for cause.

Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) Subject to the requirements of _Section 1.4(b)_, the Company hereby
grants to Parent and the Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ ") to purchase from the Company that number (but not less than that
number) of shares of Company common stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the number of shares of Company common stock that, when added to the
Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately following consummation of the
Offer, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Shares outstanding
(after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares)
for consideration per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price.

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only one time and only after the
purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer by Parent or the
Purchaser as a result of which Parent and the Purchaser own beneficially at
least 80% of the Shares outstanding. The Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable if the number of shares of Company common stock subject thereto
exceeds the number of authorized shares of Company common stock available for
issuance and not otherwise reserved for issuance by the Company.

(c) In the event that Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Parent or the Purchaser shall give the Company written notice
specifying the number of shares of Company common stock that are or will be
owned by Parent and the Purchaser immediately following consummation of the
Offer and specifying a place and a time for the closing of the purchase (which
shall not be more than three (3) Business Days after delivery of such notice)
and certifying that as promptly as practicable following such exercise the
Purchaser and Parent intend to (and Purchaser and Parent shall as promptly as
practicable after such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with
Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 1.11_. The Company shall,
as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written
notice to the Purchaser specifying the number of Top-Up Shares. At the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owing upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option that equals the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company common stock purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option,
multiplied by (ii) the Offer Price, shall be paid to the Company, at the
election of Parent and Purchaser, in cash (by wire transfer or cashiers
check) or by delivery of a promissory note having full recourse to Parent. 

(d) The Top-Up Option may not be exercised if any provision of applicable Law
or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity shall
prohibit, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity
or the Company Stockholders in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise, which
action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or
notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable.



 

6 (e) Each of Parent and the Purchaser understands that the Shares that
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and the Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is,
and will be upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor" (as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). The
Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired
upon exercise thereof are being and will be acquired for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any
distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.
Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any legends required by
applicable securities laws.

Section 1.5 _The Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and the
Purchaser shall consummate the Merger, pursuant to which (i) the Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of the Purchaser shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be
the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger and shall continue to be

of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by Law and
such Certificate of Incorporation (and subject to _Section 6.4(a)_).

Time, shall be amended in their entirety as set forth on Exhibit B hereto and,

cause the appropriate certificate of merger or certificate of ownership, as
the case may be (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed on
the Closing Date with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as
provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time
on which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of

the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors
shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

Section 1.9 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, that any
actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or the
Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to
vest all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

Section 1.10 _Stockholders  Meeting_. (a) If required by Law to consummate
the Merger, the Company shall in accordance with applicable Law:

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of
its stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable following the acceptance
for payment of Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (or, if later,
following the termination of the subsequent offering period, if any) for the
purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (the " _Company
Stockholders  Meeting_");

(ii) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy or information
statement relating to the Merger and this Agreement and use its commercially
reasonable efforts (A) to obtain and furnish the information required to be
included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement and, after consultation with
Parent, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the

_Section 1.10_, in the event that Parent, the Purchaser or any other
Subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Shares,

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Shares
or the holders of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "):

(a) Each outstanding share of Purchaser Common Stock shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares
owned by Parent, the Purchaser or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) Each outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any
required withholding of Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled,
and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without
interest thereon.



 

9 Section 2.2 _Paying Agent_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares
in connection with the Merger and to receive the funds to which holders of
Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and Option Consideration required to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in its sole
discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
Shares; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion and no such investment or loss thereon shall
effect the amounts payable to the Companys stockholders pursuant to this
_Article II_. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings
shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), whose Shares were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in
customary form and shall include customary provisions with respect to delivery
of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may
be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented
by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not required to be
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each
Certificate shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Shares on the  



 

10  records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_.

(d) At any time following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to
the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for Merger Consideration that was required to be delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law and was so delivered.

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Certificates in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent.

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has complied with
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to
perfect or such holder waives, withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right
to appraisal. A holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by such holder in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect or such holder waives, withdraws or otherwise
loses such holders right to appraisal, in which case such Shares shall be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or
Certificates representing such Shares pursuant to  _Section 2.2_.



 

11 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

Section 2.4 _Company Equity Plans_.

(a) Effective not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall terminate the Leopard Corporation Equity Compensation Plan and
any predecessor plans thereto and each other equity compensation plan pursuant
to which awards were granted to employees or directors of or other service
providers to the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Option
Plans_ "). At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of common
stock of the Company granted under the Option Plans or otherwise (each, an "
_Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto
shall become fully vested as of the Effective Time and shall by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Option be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time a cash payment (without
interest) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Offer
Price over (y) the per share exercise price of such Option, and (ii) the
number of shares subject to such Option as of the Effective Time (the, "
_Option Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all Options, whether or
not vested or exercisable, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of an Option shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Option Consideration.

(b) At the Effective Time, each (i) share of common stock that is then the
subject of a restricted stock award granted under the Option Plans or
otherwise (other than awards of Performance-Based Restricted Stock) that vests
based solely on the passage of time (each, a " _Time-Based Restricted Stock_
"), and (ii) restricted stock unit that is then the subject of a restricted
stock unit award evidencing the right to receive shares of common stock
granted under the Option Plans or otherwise (other than awards of Performance-
Based RSUs) that vests based solely on the passage of time (each, a " _Time-
Based RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall become fully
vested as of the Effective Time and shall by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of any Time-Based Restricted Stock or
Time-Based RSU be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time the Merger
Consideration in respect of each underlying share.

(c) At the Effective Time, each (i) restricted common stock award granted
under the Option Plans or otherwise that vests based on attainment
of performance goals (each, a " _Performance-Based Restricted Stock_ " and
together with the Time-Based Restricted Stock, a " _Restricted Stock_ "), and
(ii) restricted stock unit award evidencing the right to receive shares of
common stock of the Company granted under the Option Plans or otherwise that
vests based on the attainment of performance goals (each, a " _Performance-
Based RSU_ " and together with the Time-Based RSU, a " _Restricted Stock
Unit_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior  



 

12  thereto shall become fully vested as to only the target number of shares of
common stock of the Company that are the subject thereof as of the Effective
Time and shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of any Performance-Based Restricted Stock or Performance-Based RSU
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration in
respect of such target number of shares only. Any shares of common stock
subject to any Performance-Based Restricted Stock or Performance-Based RSU in
excess of the target number shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and each
holder of such Performance-Based Restricted Stock or Performance-Based RSU
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares in excess of the
target number.

(d) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)-(c)_ to any holder of Options,
Restricted Stock, or Restricted Stock Units such amounts as the Company is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Purchaser, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Options, Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock
Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was required to be
made by Purchaser. At Purchasers election, amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 2.4(a)-(c)_ may be paid to the Surviving Corporation, which shall
pay such amounts net of such withholding and pay such withholding over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action
(i) in accordance with that certain SEC no-action letter, dated January 12,
1999, to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP) to provide that the
treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units pursuant
to _Section 2.4(a)-(c)_ will qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or
(e), as applicable, under the Exchange Act, and (ii) to effect the treatment
of the Option Plans and Options, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
set forth in this _Section 2.4_, including obtaining any and all necessary
consents.

Section 4.6 _Regarding Purchaser; Approval of Arrangements_. 

(a) Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the

(b) None of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates or
associates is, as of the date of this Agreement, or has been within the

this Agreement.

Section 4.7 _Financing_. Parent has provided the Company with a true and
correct copy of a fully executed debt commitment letter and term sheet,
including all exhibits, schedules or amendments thereto (but excluding the fee
letter) as of the date of this Agreement (as amended, waived or otherwise
modified in accordance with  _Section 6.8(b)_, the " _Debt Commitment
Letter_ ") dated April 7, 2008, from its lenders party thereto pursuant to
which such lenders have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to lend $1.9 billion (the " _Financing_ ") for the purpose of
consummating the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect, has not been terminated and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent,

date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended
or modified and the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have

disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter together with unrestricted cash of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
will be sufficient for Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay all amounts
required to be paid by them pursuant to this Agreement and to pay all
estimated related fees and expenses. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent
has no knowledge of any event that has occurred which would result in any
material breach or violation under the Debt Commitment Letter, and Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available
to Parent and Purchaser on the date on which any payment for Shares is
required to be made by the Purchaser in respect of the Offer or the Merger.
There are no conditions to the obligations of the lenders party to the Debt
Commitment Letter other than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.
Parent has fully paid any commitment fees or other fees required to be paid,
to the extent payable, prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letter.

the Parent_. Parent and Purchaser each acknowledges and agrees that (a) it
has had an opportunity to discuss the business of the Company with the
Company, (b) it has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and
receive answers from the Company and (c) except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Section 1.2_, neither Parent nor
Purchaser have relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or with
respect to any information made available to Parent or Purchaser in connection
with the Transactions. The Company makes no representations and warranties
except as set forth in  _Article III_ and _Section 1.2_. Moreover neither
the Company nor any other person will have or be subject to any liability or
obligation to Parent, Purchaser or any other person resulting from the
distribution to Parent or Purchaser, or Parents or Purchasers use of, any
such information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts
or other material made available to Parent or Purchaser in the data rooms or
management presentations in connection with the Transactions, unless any such
information is included or incorporated in a representation or warranty
contained in _Article III_ or _Section 1.2_.

reasonable commercial efforts to request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information furnished during the period of two years ending

directors, employees, consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
or other agents (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or
indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information or assistance), or knowingly induce, or take any other
action designed to, or which would reasonably be expected to, facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal, or the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating
to the Company to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Person (other
than Parent or any of its affiliates or Representatives) that is seeking to
make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to make, or withdraw or

standstill or similar agreement, or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any understanding or agreement contemplating or otherwise
relating to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 5.2(a)_, prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company may, subject to compliance with this _Section 5.2_, furnish
information concerning its business, properties or assets to any Person
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality and other
provisions substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
February 4, 2008, entered into between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality_  



 

41   _Agreement_ ") and not less restrictive to such Person than the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent (a copy of which shall
be provided to Parent promptly after its execution) and may negotiate and
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning an
Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, (y) such Person has after the date of
this Agreement on an unsolicited basis, and in the absence of any violation
of this _Section 5.2_, submitted a bona fide, written proposal to the Company
relating to any such transaction which the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, is or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (z) in the good faith opinion of the Company Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, the
failure to provide such information or access or to engage in such discussions
or negotiations would be reasonably likely to cause the Company Board of
Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law. As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
bona fide written offer made by any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser or
any affiliate thereof) that if consummated would result in such Person
owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Shares (or of
the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect
parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of
the Companys assets, which the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and in light of all relevant circumstances and all terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement or, if applicable,
any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, (x) is more
favorable to the Company Stockholders than the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms so
proposed and (z) to the extent financing is required, has financing that is
fully committed or which the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) is reasonably capable of being timely financed by such third
party. The Company shall contemporaneously provide to Parent any such
information provided to such Person (or, with respect to any such information
which was previously provided to Parent, a list identifying such information).

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty four-hours and
prior to providing any such Person with any material non-public information)
orally and in writing notify Parent if any proposals are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any Company Representative,
in each case, in connection with, or which could reasonably be expected to
result in, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify the name of
the Person making such proposal or request or seeking such negotiations or
discussions and the material terms and conditions of such proposal or request
and include copies of all correspondence and written materials provided to the
Company or any Company Representative that describe any terms and conditions
of any proposal or request (and any subsequent changes to such terms and
conditions) and summaries of any material oral communications addressing such
matters. The Company shall (x) promptly keep Parent fully informed in all
material respects of the status and details of any Acquisition Proposal
(including any changes in the material terms thereof) and (y) promptly upon
receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with
copies of all drafts and final versions (and any comments thereon) of
agreements (including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any
Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the Company or any
Company Representative, on the one hand, and the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal or any of its representatives, on the other hand.



 

42 (d) Any violation of this _Section 5.2_ by any of the Companys
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

(e) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors nor
any committee thereof shall (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board
of Directors may (subject to the terms of this and the following sentence)
(y) in response to information obtained after the date of this Agreement, make
an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board of Directors has
concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Company Board of Directors to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to cause the directors to
breach their fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (z) enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_
"), in each case, at any time after the fifth Business Day following the
Companys delivery to Parent of written notice advising Parent that the
Company Board of Directors intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
that the Company has received a Superior Proposal (and otherwise in accordance
with the notice requirements set forth in  _Section 5.2(c_)), as applicable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not enter into an Acquisition
Agreement unless the Company complies with _Section 5.2(f)_. Any such Adverse
Recommendation Change or the entry by the Company into any Acquisition
Agreement shall not change the approval of the Company Board of Directors for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state Law to be
applicable to the Transactions (including each of the Offer and the Merger).
Effective as of the time of the Companys delivery to Parent of any notice
referred to above, Section 11 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall become
null and void and of no further force and effect.

(f) The Company may terminate this Agreement and enter into an Acquisition
Agreement, provided that, prior to any such termination, (i) the
Company shall have provided Parent written notice that it intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.2(f)_, identifying the
Superior Proposal then determined to be more favorable and the parties thereto
and delivering to Parent a copy of the Acquisition Agreement for such
Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into, (ii) within a period of
three full Business Days following the delivery of the notice referred to in
clause (i) above, Parent shall not have proposed adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement which, after having used its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate with
Parent in good faith such proposed adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor) to be as favorable to
the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal, and (iii) at least five
full Business Days after the Company has provided the notice referred to in
clause (i) above, the Company shall have delivered to Parent (A) a written
notice of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 5.2(f)_
and (B) a wire transfer of immediately available funds in the amount of the
Company Termination Fee (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal

Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position  



 

43  contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors,
after consultation with outside counsel to the Company, the failure to take
such action would cause the Company Board of Directors to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
disclosure that (i) does not reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, (ii)
with respect to any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal, goes
beyond a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iii)
does not expressly reject such Acquisition Proposal, shall be deemed a Adverse
Recommendation Change.

Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder of the Purchaser and deliver to
Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent approving and

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law, from
and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall
give prompt notice to the other party of the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of a party to effect the
Offer, the Merger or the Transactions not to be satisfied. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any notice of, or other communication relating
to, a default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default, received by the Company subsequent to the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any Material Contract or any
Contract entered into after the date of this Agreement that if in effect on
the date of this Agreement would be a Material Contract, to which the Company
is a party or is subject. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, shall give prompt written notice to the other party of (a) any
notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent
of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) any regulatory notice, report or results
of inspection from the FDA or any similar Governmental Entity or (c) any
Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties or covenants of the parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties hereunder. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent
permitted by Law, promptly provide the other with copies of all filings made
by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions, other than the portions of such filing that include
confidential or proprietary information not directly related to the
Transactions.

Section 6.2 _Access; Confidentiality_. From the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company shall afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financing sources and other Representatives of Parent and the Purchaser,
reasonable access, during normal business hours to the Companys  



 

44  properties, books, records and personnel and all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or the Purchaser
may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
be required to provide access to any information or documents which would, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) breach any agreement of the
Company with any third-party, (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
or other privilege held by the Company, (iii) otherwise violate any applicable
Law or (iv) which would result in a competitor of the Company receiving
material information which is competitively sensitive. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Purchaser will hold any information obtained pursuant to
this _Section 6.2_ in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall affect any
representation or warranty made by the parties hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the Companys employees of their normal duties.

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. Each of Parent and the Company shall consult with the
other regarding their initial press releases with respect to the execution of
this Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue
any press release or other announcement with respect to the Transactions or
this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such press
release or other announcement may be required by Law or the rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such release or announcement in advance of its issuance.

Section 6.4 _Insurance and Indemnification_. (a) The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees
and agents of the Company than are set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Company as of the date of this Agreement,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights of individuals, who were directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time, unless
such modification shall be required by Law.

(b) Prior to the fifth Business Day preceding the Acceptance Time, Parent
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope)
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
officers and directors liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_") maintained
by the Company, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Tail Policy_ "). In the event that Parent does not purchase a
Tail Policy as provided in the preceding sentence, the Company shall have the
right to purchase, prior to the Effective Time, the Tail Policy. If neither
Parent nor the Company has purchased a Tail Policy, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain the Companys existing DandO Insurance for a period
of not less than six years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that
Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially  



 

45  equivalent coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable to such
former directors or officers; provided that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that
any substitution or replacement of existing policies shall not result in any
gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to facts, events, acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, further, that if the
existing DandO Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such
period, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain substantially
similar DandO Insurance; provided further, however, that in no event shall
Parent or Purchaser be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under
this _Section 6.4(b)_ in excess of 250% of the current annual premiums paid
by the Company for such insurance.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against any individual who is now, or who has
been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 6.4_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(d) The covenants contained in this _Section 6.4_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the indemnified parties and
their respective heirs and legal Representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an indemnified party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Parent shall pay all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons
referred to in this _Section 6.4_ in connection with their successful
enforcement of their rights provided in this _Section 6.4_.

(e) In the event that the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_.

Section 6.5 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company agrees to use its respective reasonable
best efforts to (i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, under the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable including, but not limited to, using
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals,
consents, authorizations, orders, exemptions or waivers by any third Person
or Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Offer and the Merger and (iii) not take any action that
would be reasonably likely to materially interfere with their ability to
consummate the Transactions. If at any time after the  



 

46  Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each
party hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all
such action. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and to use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, including
requesting early termination of the HSR Act waiting period. 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, without limitation: (i) promptly
notify the other of, and if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or,
in the case of oral communications, advise the other of) any communications
from or with any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions; (ii)
permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or any oral
communication with any such Governmental Entity; (iii) not participate in any
meeting or have any communication with any such Governmental Entity unless it
has given the other an opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate therein; and (iv) furnish the other
party with copies of all filings and communications between it (or its
advisors) and any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the rights of the Company and Parent under this _Section 6.5(b)_
may be exercised on their behalf by their respective outside counsel.

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use all reasonable
efforts to vigorously contest and resist any action, including administrative
or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the Transactions, including, without limitation, by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

(d) In no event shall Parent or Purchaser be obligated pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_ to divest or hold separate any assets or to take or commit to
take any action that which would be reasonably likely to (i) materially
adversely impact the benefits expected to be derived by Parent, as a result of
the Transactions or (ii) impose material limitations on Parents ownership or
operation (or that of any of Parents Subsidiaries or affiliates) of all or a
material portion of the Companys business or assets, including Parents
exercise of rights of full ownership of the Shares purchased by Purchaser in
the Offer on all stockholder matters.

Section 6.6 _State Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover statute becomes or
is deemed to become applicable to the Company or the Transactions, then the
Company Board of Directors shall take all actions necessary to render such
statutes inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 6.7 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the  



 

47  Company and/or its directors or executive officers relating to the

of this Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to
settle in exchange for the payment of funds any litigation commenced prior to
or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or any of its
directors or executive officers by any stockholder of the Company relating to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction, without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

Section 6.8 _Financial Information and Cooperation_.

(a) During the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its,
and shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Company
Representatives to use their, reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate and
assist Parent and Purchaser with respect to the arrangement of Parents
Financing (or any alternative financing contemplated by _Section 6.8(c)_, as
the case may be); _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would, in the Companys reasonable judgment,
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or
otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and
timely discharge by the Companys employees of their normal duties;
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Company to (1) pay any commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any liability
or obligation under any loan agreement or related document, unless and until
the Closing occurs or (3) until the Closing occurs, incur any other liability
in connection with the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(or any alternative financing contemplated by _Section 6.8(c)_, as the case
may be). Subject to the provisos in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to provide, and shall use
its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Representatives of the Company
to provide, such reasonable cooperation as may be requested in connection with
the arrangement and consummation of the Financing, including (a) using its
reasonable commercial efforts to furnish, on a confidential basis, to
Parents or Purchasers financing sources financial and other pertinent
information with respect to the Company and the Transactions as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including information and projections
prepared by the Company relating to the Company and the Transactions, (b)

meetings and drafting sessions and (iii) participate in presentations related
to the Financing, including presentations to rating agencies, (c) using its
reasonable commercial efforts to (i) assist, and to cause the Company
Representatives to use their reasonable commercial efforts to assist, in the

or Purchasers financing sources in preparing and delivering other
appropriate and customary marketing and closing materials, in each case to be
used in connection with the Financing, (d) reasonably cooperating with the
marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any of the
Financing, (e) using reasonable commercial efforts to assist Parent in
obtaining comfort letters of the Companys accountants, consents of the
Companys accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Financing, and legal opinions (which may be reasoned) of the Companys
counsel and (f) using reasonable commercial efforts to facilitate the pledge
of the Companys assets as  



 

48  collateral (such pledge only to become effective following consummation of
the Offer). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in
connection with such cooperation provided by the Company, its officers and the
other Company Representatives pursuant to the terms of this _Section 6.8_.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and the
other Company Representatives from and against any and all liabilities or
losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than

commencing litigation) against the lenders and other persons providing the
Financing to fund such Financing and (ii) using all reasonable best efforts
to (A) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Purchaser to obtaining the
Financing, (C) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, and (D) consummate the
Financing at or prior to the consummation of the Offer. Parent shall not, and
shall not permit Purchaser to, agree to or permit any amendment, supplement
or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Financing, if
such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would be reasonably
expected to prevent, delay or hinder Parent or Purchasers ability to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions, in each case, without
the Companys prior written consent. Parent shall promptly furnish to the
Company a complete copy of any amendment, supplement or other modification to
the Debt Commitment Letter and a full description of any waiver of Parents
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the
manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, (A)

are not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but in no event later than the first
date on which any payment for Shares is required to be made by the Purchaser
in respect of the Offer or the Merger, including entering into definitive
agreements with respect thereto. In the event that alternative financing shall
be secured pursuant to this _Section 6.8(c)_, Parent and Purchaser shall
comply with the covenants in _Section 6.8(b)_ with respect to such
alternative financing and shall promptly furnish to the Company the debt
commitment letter and term sheet, including all exhibits, schedules or
amendments thereto (or similar documents), with respect to such alternative
financing.

approval, amendment or modification of each such Arrangement shall be approved
as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit

its independent directors and by the Board of Directors of Parent, the
Compensation Committee of such Board or its independent directors.



 

50 (b) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five Business Days

of the Company have been adopted by the Company Board of Directors or its
delegates. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of Parent. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take such other actions in furtherance of terminating

deferrals made pursuant to any such 401(k) Plan for the period prior to

any fractional share in each participants account.

Section 6.11 _Employee Benefits Matters_. For purposes of this Section 6.11,

and benefits provided or made available by the Company to such Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, credit each Company Employee with full credit for
purposes of eligibility and vesting for the Company Employees service with

programs, policies and arrangements (including vacation and leave of absence
policies), maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after
the Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation
(each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the extent such service was recognized for such
purpose by a comparable benefit plan, program,  



 

51  policy and arrangement of the Company (but not to the extent that such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits). With respect to each Parent
Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),

limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
or reimbursable to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the

Corporation to, permit each Company Employee who satisfied the eligibility
requirements of the Companys 401(k) plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to
participate in the 401(k) plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") immediately following the Effective Time. Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Parent 401(k)
Plan to accept rollovers of distributions (or direct rollovers) from the
Company 401(k) Plan (including rollovers (or direct rollovers) of any
outstanding loan(s) of a Company Employee under the Company 401(k) Plan in
kind).

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with its terms, (x)
each existing employment, change in control, severance and termination
protection plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of the Company that is
disclosed under  _Section 3.12(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (y)
all existing obligations and/or accrued benefits under any employee benefit
plan, policy, program or arrangement of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and (z) except as otherwise provided in an individual
employment agreement, all obligations and/or accrued benefits under all plans,
programs or agreements of the Company that provide for bonuses.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee of the Company in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) with Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. Nothing contained herein shall preclude Parent or the Surviving

time and for any reason.

(i)(A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (B) the Company

by Parent that it do so after the Company receives or otherwise becomes aware
of an Acquisition Proposal; or

(ii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement which (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (d) or
(e) of _Annex I_ hereto and (B) is not cured or is incapable of being cured by
the earlier of (1) ten (10) days after the giving of written notice to the
Company or (2) the Outside Date; or

material respect, any of its obligations under _Section 5.2_; or

of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement which (A) would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse

Section 8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event
of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written

54  (except for the third from final sentence of _Section 6.2_, and for
_Sections 9.3_ , _9.5_ , _9.6_ , _9.7_ , _9.8_ ,  _9.9_ , _9.11_ , _9.13_ ,
_9.14_ , _9.15_ and this _Section 8.2_, which shall survive such termination)
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, the Purchaser or the
Company, except (i) as set forth in _Section 6.2_ and this _Section 8.2_,
and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for damages

(b) If:

(i) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section

(ii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(i)_; or

(iii) (A) either Parent or the Company shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_, _8.1(b)(iii)_ , or _8.1(c)(ii)_ , (B) prior

_8.1(b)(iii)_ , or _8.1(c)(ii)_ , a Person shall have made or publicly
announced an Acquisition Proposal that was not bona fidely and irrevocably
withdrawn at the time of termination and (C) within twelve months after any
such termination either (1) the Company enters into an agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or (2) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated;
provided, that for the purpose of this  _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_, all
references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "20%" shall instead
be deemed to refer to "50%";

then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $50,000,000 (the "
_Company Termination Fee_ ") (A) concurrently with such termination in the
case of a termination pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, (B) within one
Business Day after such termination in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Sections 8.1(c)(i)_ or _8.1(c)(iii)_ and (C) upon the earlier of the entry
into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation
of an Acquisition Proposal in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_, _8.1(b)(iii)_ or _8.1(c)(ii)_. The Company Termination Fee shall
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as
Parent may designate in writing to the Company. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement (including in _Section 9.9_) other than the
proviso to this sentence, the parties agree that the payment of the Company
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and
Purchaser with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions in the event the
Company Termination Fee becomes due and payable under the terms of this
Agreement, and, upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall
have no further liability to Parent and Purchaser hereunder; _provided_ that
the foregoing limitation shall not apply in the event of any liabilities or
damages incurred or suffered by Parent or Purchaser in the case of (i) a
breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct
or (ii) a willful and intentional material breach of  _Section 5.2_.

(c) If (i) either Parent or the Company shall have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or _8.1(b)(iii)_ and at the time of such
termination the conditions to the Offer set forth in paragraphs (a) through
(f) of _Annex I_ have been satisfied or  



 

55  waived or (ii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ or _8.1(d)(iv)_ , then Parent shall pay to the Company
a termination fee of $50,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") within one
Business Day after such termination. The Parent Termination Fee shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as the
Company may designate in writing to Parent. The parties agree that the payment
of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available
to the Company with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions in the
event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in this _Section
8.2(c)_, and, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, Parent and Purchaser
shall have no further liability to the Company hereunder; _provided_ that the
foregoing limitation shall (i) not limit the remedies available to the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.9_ in the event the Agreement is not
terminated as provided in this _Section 8.2(c)_ and (ii) shall not apply in
the event of any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the Company
in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or
intentional misconduct.

Section 9.6 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The words
describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa. The
parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.
Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement, the Table of Contents
and the Index of Defined Terms are for the convenience of the parties only and
shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

Section 9.7 _Jurisdiction_. Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company hereby expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (the " _Delaware Court_ ") in
connection with all disputes arising out of or in connection  



 

59  with this Agreement or the Transactions and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such court. Each such party hereby
waives the right to any other jurisdiction or venue for any litigation
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions to
which any of them may be entitled by reason of its present or future domicile.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such party agrees that each of the other
parties shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement
of a judgment entered by the Delaware Court in any other court or
jurisdiction.

Section 9.8 _Service of Process_. Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company irrevocably consents to the service of process outside
the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 9.7_ of
this Agreement in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by
registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.5_ of this Agreement.
However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service
of process on the other party by any other legally available method.

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this
Agreement, each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately
harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and (b) shall be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at Law
or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement and to
injunctive relief, and the parties further agree to waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
such specific performance or injunctive relief. For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties agree that the Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of or enforce
compliance with those covenants of Parent or Purchaser that require Parent or
Purchaser to (i) use its best efforts to obtain the Financing, including the
covenant set forth in _Section 6.8_, and use its reasonable best efforts to
satisfy the conditions to the Offer and (ii) consummate the Transactions, if
in the case of this clause (ii), the Financing (or any alternative financing
obtained in accordance with _Section 6.8(c))_ is available to be drawn down
by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreements but
is not so drawn down solely as a result of Parent or Purchaser failing to do
so. The Companys pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be
deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other
right or remedy to which the Company may be entitled, including the right to
pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the
Company in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful
or intentional misconduct or the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to the terms
of and in accordance with  _Section 8.2(c)_.

Section 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
a counterpart of this Agreement shall have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other parties. 

Section 9.11 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes
all other prior agreements and  



 

60  understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof (provided that the
provisions of this Agreement shall supersede any conflicting provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement). Except as provided in _Section 6.4_, nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. 

Section 9.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that the Purchaser may assign any
or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Parent, but no
such assignment shall relieve Parent or Purchaser of any of its obligations
under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and permitted
assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this  _Section 9.14_
shall be null and void.

Section 9.15 _Obligation of Parent_. Whenever this Agreement requires
Purchaser to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Purchaser to take such action and a
guarantee of the payment and performance thereof.



 

61 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized
as of the date first written above.
