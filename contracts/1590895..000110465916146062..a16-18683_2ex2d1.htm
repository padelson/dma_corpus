Entity following the Second Step Merger, and such units of membership interest
shall constitute the only outstanding equity securities of the Final Surviving
Entity at such time; and

 



 

(ii) each share of capital stock of the Intermediate Surviving Entity then
outstanding shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) The Mergers shall have no effect on the outstanding capital stock of

benefit plan), (ii) be converted into a number of restricted stock units,
deferred stock units or phantom units, as applicable, in respect of shares of
Parent Common Stock, in an amount equal to the Per Share Stock Consideration
(with aggregated fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share), and
(iii) remain subject to the same restrictions and other terms as are set forth
in the Company Stock Plan, the award agreement pursuant to which such Company
RSU was granted, and, if applicable, any other relevant agreements (such as an
employment agreement or applicable employee benefit plan).

 



 

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and its
compensation committee, as applicable, and Parent, the Parent Board, and its

submitted with an Election Form, " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify to the holders of Certificates that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass,
only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s)) to the Exchange Agent in a form to be mutually agreed upon by
Company and Parent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions
for use in surrendering Certificate(s) for shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, any amounts in respect of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ and any dividends or distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_.

 



 

(b) Upon surrender by a holder of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent
of its Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal or, to the extent received prior to the Election Deadline, a
properly completed Election Form, such holder of Company Common Stock will be
entitled to receive (and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to
each such holder) promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event no later

 



      
 

 



 

than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
and any amounts in respect of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_ in respect of
the Company Common Stock represented by such holders Certificate(s). Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time,
for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II_.

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and
until the surrender of such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(g)_) in accordance with this _Article
II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive,
without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the
whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not
paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time
(but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the
issuance of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Company Common Stock that was issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration (and amounts in respect of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_).

 



 

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates. Each
holder of Company Common Stock that would otherwise be entitled to a
fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest
and subject to the amount of any withholding taxes as contemplated in _Section
2.2(i)_) equal to such holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds
from the sale or sales by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section 2.2(e)_, on behalf of all such holders, of the Excess
Securities. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock into which the Company Common Stock was converted pursuant
to _Section 1.6(a)(iii)_ over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the former holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)(iii)_ (such excess being herein called
the " _Excess Securities_ ") and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former
holders of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Securities at the
prevailing prices on NASDAQ. The sale of the Excess Securities by the Exchange
Agent shall be executed on NASDAQ through one or more member firms of NASDAQ
and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange
Agent shall deduct from the proceeds of sale of the Excess Securities all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with such sale of Excess Securities. Until the net proceeds of such
sale of Excess Securities have been distributed to the former stockholders of
the Company, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds and dividends in
trust for such former stockholders. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to former stockholders of
the Company for any fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall make
available in accordance with this Agreement such amounts to such former
stockholders.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the former
stockholders of the Company as of the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective
Time may, at Parents option, be paid to Parent (together with any dividends
in respect thereof). In such event, any former holder of Company Common Stock
who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any amounts in
respect of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each such share of Company
Common Stock such former holder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. The Exchange Agent will notify Parent
prior to the time that any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed
would have to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws and, at Parents option, such
portion shall be paid to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws.

 



 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange
Fund pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ and any losses resulting from such
investments will be made up by Parent to the extent that such losses cause the
total amount of cash in the Exchange Fund to fall below the amount necessary
to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(i) Parent, the Company, the Intermediate Surviving Entity and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent, the Company,
the Intermediate Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent may be required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
or any other provision of applicable federal, state, local or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Company, the
Intermediate Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent and duly paid over to the
applicable taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.3 _Election Procedures_.

 



 

(a) A Letter of Transmittal, an election form and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials in such form as Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed thirty-five (35) days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date or on such other date as Parent and the
Company shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record
of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth (5th)
Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_").

 



 

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (the "
_Stock Election Shares_ "), (ii) the number of shares of such holders Company
Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration (the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") and (iii) the number of
shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder
makes no election to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per
Share Cash Consideration (the " _No Election Shares_ "). Any Company Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) with respect to which the Exchange Agent
has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the thirtieth (30th) day following the
Mailing Date (or such other time and date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to be No
Election Shares.

 



 

(c) The Company shall make available one or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by any person who becomes a holder
(or beneficial owner) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election
Deadline.

 



 

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials (including a Letter of Transmittal) included in the
Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person
submitting such Election Form only by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked
prior to the Election Deadline, unless a subsequent properly completed
Election Form is submitted and actually received by the Exchange Agent by the
Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become No Election Shares and the Company shall cause the
applicable Certificates to be promptly returned without charge to the person
submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the
holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion
to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Company or the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
person of any defect in an Election Form.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, (i) the
quotient of (A) the aggregate dollar value of the Stock Consideration
(assuming that each share of Parent Common Stock has a value of $14.04) and
(B) the Aggregate Total Consideration (the " _Stock Percentage_ ") shall equal
42% (the " _Required Stock Percentage_ ") and (ii) the quotient of (A) Cash
Consideration plus aggregate Dissenting Stockholder Consideration (assuming
the amount payable for each Dissenting Share is equal to the Per Share Cash
Consideration) and (B) the Aggregate Total Consideration (the " _Cash
Percentage_ ") shall equal 58% (the " _Required Cash Percentage_ ").

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, (i) the
maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be converted into
the right to receive Stock Consideration shall be equal to the Required Stock
Percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Maximum
Stock Shares_ ") and (ii) the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock
that may be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and
Dissenting Stockholder Consideration shall be equal to the Required Cash
Percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Maximum
Cash Shares_ ").

 



 

(g) Within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the former holders of
Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Merger Consideration as follows:

 



 

(i) _Cash Oversubscribed_. If the total number of the Cash Election Shares
plus the Dissenting Shares would cause the Cash Percentage to exceed the
Required Cash Percentage, then:

 



 

(A) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;

 



 

(B) each of the holders of Cash Election Shares shall have an amount of their
Cash Election Shares (the " _Stock Designated Shares_ ") equal to the product
of (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder and (y) one (1)
minus a fraction, the numerator of which is a number equal to the number of
Maximum Cash Shares minus the number of Dissenting Shares and the denominator
of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

 



 

(C) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

 



 

(ii) _Stock Oversubscribed_. If the total number of the Stock Election Shares
would cause the Stock Percentage to exceed the Required Stock Percentage,
then:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) all Cash Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

 



 

(B) each of the holders of Stock Election Shares shall have an amount of their
Stock Election Shares (the " _Cash Designated Shares_ ") equal to the product
of (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder and (y) one (1)
minus a fraction, the numerator of which is the Maximum Stock Shares and the
denominator of which is the total number of Stock Election Shares, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and

 



 

(C) the Stock Election Shares that are not Cash Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 



 

(iii) _Neither Cash nor Stock Oversubscribed_. If the total number of the
Stock Election Shares is less than the Maximum Stock Shares and the total
number of the Cash Election Shares plus the Dissenting Shares is less than the
Maximum Cash Shares (the amount by which the Maximum Cash Shares exceeds the
total number of Cash Election Shares, the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then:

 



 

(A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration;

 



 

(B) all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration;

 



 

(C) each of the holders of No Election Shares shall have an amount of their No
Election Shares (the " _No Election Cash Designated Shares_ ") equal to the
product of (x) the number of No Election Shares held by such holder and (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is a number equal to the Shortfall Number
minus the number of Dissenting Shares and the denominator of which is the
total number of No Election Shares, converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration; and

 



 

(D) the No Election Shares that are not No Election Cash Designated Shares
will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this _Section 2.3_, Company
Restricted Shares shall not be treated as Company Common Stock.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.1_ and
_Section 5.2_, in the event that the Company changes the number of shares of
Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time, in each case as a result of a reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
merger, subdivision, exchange, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted as appropriate.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.5 _Uncertificated Shares_. In the case of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock that are not represented by Certificates, the parties
shall make such adjustments to this _Article II_ as are necessary or
appropriate to implement the same purpose and effect that this _Article II_
has with respect to shares of Company Common Stock that are represented by
Certificates.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Mergers (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ")
shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive Merger
Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Stockholder Consideration_
") (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost its
right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
holders shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into
and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration for each such Share, and such shares shall be treated
as Cash Election Shares under this Agreement and shall not be subject to the
provisions of _Section 2.3(g)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
and a copy of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are
received by the Company relating to Company Stockholders rights of appraisal,
and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal by Company stockholders
under the DGCL, so long as Parent does not create any pre-Closing obligations
of the Company. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

such forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed since
January 1, 2013 and prior to the date hereof, collectively, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment, each of the Company SEC Documents complied as to form
in all respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ "), and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be, each as in effect on
the date so filed. As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
such amendment or superseding filing), none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Companys Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC.

 



 

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) included in the Companys Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended April 24, 2016 filed with the SEC have been
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. The unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company (including any related notes
thereto) included in the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with
the SEC since April 24, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or may be permitted by the SEC under the
Exchange Act) and fairly present in all respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof and the

 



      
 

 



 

results of their operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (subject
to normal period-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (and each former principal executive officer

regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
correct.

 



 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e), and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities and that all material information

furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.

reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions
are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared

completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys system of
internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of SOX for the fiscal year ended April 24, 2016, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective and the Companys
independent registered accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn
or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 24, 2016. To
the knowledge of the Company, since April 25, 2016, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Companys independent registered accountant has identified
or been made aware of: (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting utilized
by the Company and its Subsidiaries; (B) any illegal act or fraud related to
the operations or business of the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether or not
material, that involves the Companys management; or (C) any claim or
allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

regulations and applicable listing requirements of NASDAQ, and has not since
January 1, 2013 received any notice asserting any non-compliance with any of

Section 3.8 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its

the Companys consolidated balance sheet on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended April 24, 2016 filed with the SEC, (b) incurred in the ordinary course
of business since the date of such balance sheet, none of which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, (c) which have been discharged or paid in full
prior to the date of this Agreement or (d) incurred pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Since April 25, 2016, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any off-balance sheet
transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or
other relationships with other Persons that may have a current or future
material effect on financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures, capital resources or significant components of revenues
or expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 3.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since April 25, 2016

receipt of the approval of the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative
vote of two-thirds of the voting power of the Company, voting as a single
class, in person or by proxy, at the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "

any class or series of capital stock of the Company is necessary to approve
this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Compliance with Laws_. Except with respect to Taxes, ERISA,

Laws, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Laws
applicable to them or by which any of their respective properties are bound,
except where any non-compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Except with respect to Environmental Laws (which are the subject of _Section
3.17_ ), the Company and its Subsidiaries have been and are in compliance with
all permits, licenses, exemptions, authorizations, franchises, orders and
approvals of all Governmental Entities (collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary
for them to own, lease or operate their properties and to carry on their
businesses as now conducted, except for any Permits the absence of, or
noncompliance with, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective directors or officers nor, to the
Companys knowledge, any of their respective

 



      
 

 



 

employees or agents for or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries (i)

Practices Act_ ") or any rules or regulations thereunder or any other

is subject relating to corruption, bribery, money laundering, political
contributions or gifts and gratuities, to public officials and private
persons.

 



 

Section 3.12 _Licensability_. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
any of their respective officers, directors, partners, managers, members,
principals or Affiliates that will be included in the process of determining
the suitability of the Company for a Gaming Approval by a Gaming Authority,
or, to the Companys knowledge, any holders of the Companys capital stock or
other equity interests who will be required to be licensed or found suitable
under applicable Gaming Laws (the foregoing Persons collectively, the "
_Company Licensing Affiliates_ "), has ever abandoned or withdrawn (in each
case in response to a communication from a Gaming Authority regarding a likely
or impending denial, suspension or revocation) or been denied or had suspended
or revoked a Gaming Approval, or an application for a Gaming Approval, by a
Gaming Authority. The Company, its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective
Company Licensing Affiliates which is licensed or holds any Gaming Approval
pursuant to applicable Gaming Laws (collectively, the " _Company Licensed
Parties_ ") is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in which such
Company Licensed Party owns, operates, or manages gaming facilities. To the
Companys knowledge, there are no facts which, if known to any Gaming
Authority, would be reasonably likely to (i) result in the denial, revocation,
limitation or suspension of a Gaming Approval of any of the Company Licensed
Parties or (ii) result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability
proceedings of any of the Company Licensed Parties currently pending, or under
the suitability proceedings necessary for the consummation of the Mergers.

(a) Each of the Company Licensed Parties, and to the Companys knowledge, each

Principals_ "), holds all Gaming Approvals and all such Permits as are
necessary to conduct the business and operations of the Company Licensed
Parties as currently conducted, each of which is in full force and effect in
all respects, and no event has occurred which permits, or upon the giving of
notice or passage of time or both would permit, revocation, non-renewal,
modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Permit that
currently is in effect, the loss of which, either individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Neither the Company, nor any of the Company Licensing Affiliates, has
received notice of any investigation or review by any Gaming Authority or
other Governmental Entity with respect to the Company, any Company Licensing
Affiliates or Company Management Principals that is pending, and, to

 



      
 

 



 

the knowledge of the Company, no investigation or review is threatened, nor

to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of which would not
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 



 

(b) No Company Licensed Party, and no Company Licensing Affiliate or Company
Management Principal of any Company Licensed Party, has received any written
claim, demand, notice, complaint, court order or administrative order from any
Gaming Authority or other Governmental Entity in the past three (3) years

which did or would be reasonably likely to result in an individual fine or
penalty of $25,000 or more. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts which if known to any Gaming Authority could reasonably be expected to
result in the revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming Approval or
other license, finding of suitability, registration, permit or approval of the
Company Licensed Parties or any of their respective Company Licensing
Affiliates or Company Management Principals. None of the Company Licensed
Parties, and none of their respective Company Licensing Affiliates or Company

behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely filed in
accordance with all applicable Laws (after giving effect to any extensions of
time in which to make such filings), and all such Tax Returns are true,
correct and complete in all material respects. There is no outstanding
material claim in writing by any Governmental Entity where the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries does not file a particular type of Tax Return that it is
required to file such Tax Return or may be subject to Tax.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent in the

waiver or extension of the statute of limitations in respect of a material
amount of Taxes (other than pursuant to extensions of time to file Tax Returns

income tax purposes for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date initiated by the Company or any Subsidiary prior to

consent of Parent.

 



 

(f) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take
any action nor is the Company aware of any agreement, plan or other

as applicable, from the IRS that it is so qualified (or the deadline for
obtaining such a letter has not expired as of the date of this Agreement) and,
to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of such
letter that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualified
status of such Company Plan.

ERISA (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), has any liability under Title IV of ERISA
which has not been satisfied in full, other than with respect to a
Multiemployer Plan.

of the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide, post-termination or retiree
life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other post-
termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any reason,
except as may be required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation

benefit amount, the payment of a contingent benefit or the acceleration of the

transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with another
event).

 



 

(i) No amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any individuals under any Company Plan will
be an "excess parachute payment," as such term is defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code. The Company has not taken any action with respect to
2016 annual incentive awards and/or 2017 annual incentive awards that would
cause such awards to be nondeductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. The
Company is not obligated to compensate any Person for excise taxes payable
pursuant to Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(j) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, there are no
Actions, audits or inquiries pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company,

the terms thereof (or the applicable collective bargaining agreement) by the
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates have been timely made.

complete list of all Company Registered IP. To the knowledge of the Company,

IP. All Company Registered IP is solely and exclusively owned by the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens), and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice or claim challenging the validity or enforceability of any
Company Registered IP that remains pending or unresolved.

steps to maintain the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, including taking commercially reasonable steps to safeguard

Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person in a manner that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notice or claim asserting that any such infringement
or misappropriation is occurring or has occurred, which notice or claim
remains pending or unresolved, and that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

since January 1, 2013 that a third Person is misappropriating or infringing
any Owned Company Intellectual Property and, to the knowledge of the Company,

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company or
its Subsidiaries solely and exclusively own all right, title and interest in
and to (including the sole right to enforce) the Owned Company Intellectual
Property, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and have
not granted any license, covenant, release, immunity or other right with
respect to any Owned Company Intellectual Property to any Person other than
non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of business in
connection with marketing and promotional activities. All of the Company
Intellectual Property that is necessary to the business or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that is not Owned Company
Intellectual Property is duly and validly licensed to the Company or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid and enforceable Contract. For avoidance of
doubt, the preceding sentence does not constitute a representation or warranty
with respect to non-infringement of

 



      
 

 



 

Patents of any third Person, which is addressed separately in _Section
3.21(c)_. Following the Closing, the Final Surviving Entity will own or have,
and will be permitted to exercise, the same rights that the Company and its
Subsidiaries had immediately prior to the Closing with respect to Intellectual
Property and Intellectual Property Rights (other than off-the-shelf computer
programs), in each case that are material to the operations of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, without the payment of any
additional amounts or consideration (other than ongoing fees, royalties or

required to pay had this Agreement not been entered into and the transactions
not occurred).

Company, since January 1, 2013, no Person (including any Governmental Entity)
has made any claim or commenced any action with respect to loss, damage or
unauthorized access, use, modification or breach of security of Personal
Information maintained by or on behalf of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, in each case that are material to the operations of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers
or other transactions contemplated hereby will, or reasonably would be
expected to, result in any material violation of any privacy policy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any applicable Law pertaining to privacy, data
security or Personal Information.

 



 

Section 3.22 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except for directors and employment-
related Company Material Contracts identified in _Section 3.18 of the Company

contemplated hereby, including the Mergers.

correct copy of all contracts between the Company and Credit Suisse Securities

entitled to any payment relating to the Mergers or other transactions

2013 (all such forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents
filed since January 1, 2013 and prior to the date hereof, collectively, the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of

as to form in all respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and SOX, and the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date so

subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment
or superseding filing), none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to

accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. The unaudited

13a-15(e), and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made

ended December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls were

in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent, (c) which have been discharged or paid in full prior to the
date of this Agreement or (d) incurred pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Since January 1, 2016, neither Parent nor any

Stock (the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_ "). No other vote or consent of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to
approve the Share Issuance, this Agreement or the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub A and as the sole member of Merger Sub B (each of

consents of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub
A or Merger Sub B necessary to approve this Agreement, the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

and Gaming Laws, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
all Laws applicable to them or by which any of their respective properties are
bound, except where any non-compliance would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Except with respect to Environmental Laws (which are the subject of _Section
4.17_), Parent and its Subsidiaries have been and are in compliance with all
Permits necessary for them to own, lease or operate their properties and to
carry on their businesses as now conducted, except for any Permits the absence
of, or noncompliance with, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. All
Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective directors or officers nor, to
Parents knowledge, any of their respective employees or agents for or on
behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries (i) has made, authorized or offered or is

or Affiliates that will be

for a Gaming Approval by a Gaming Authority, or, to Parents knowledge, any
holders of Parents capital stock or other equity interests who will be
required to be licensed or found suitable under applicable Gaming Laws (the
foregoing Persons collectively, the " _Parent Licensing Affiliates_ "), has
ever abandoned or withdrawn (in each case in response to a communication from
a Gaming Authority regarding a likely or impending denial, suspension or
revocation) or been denied or had suspended or revoked a Gaming Approval, or
an application for a Gaming Approval, by a Gaming Authority. Parent, its
Subsidiaries, and each of their respective Parent Licensing Affiliates which
is licensed or holds any Gaming Approval pursuant to applicable Gaming Laws
(collectively, the " _Parent Licensed Parties_ ") is in good standing in each
of the jurisdictions in which such Parent Licensed Party owns, operates or
manages gaming facilities. To Parents knowledge, there are no facts which, if
known to any Gaming Authority, would be reasonably likely to (i) result in the
denial, revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming Approval of any of
the Parent Licensed Parties or (ii) result in a negative outcome to any
finding of suitability proceedings of any of the Parent Licensed Parties
currently pending, or under the suitability proceedings necessary for the
consummation of the Mergers.

"), holds all Gaming Approvals and all such Permits as are necessary to
conduct the business and operations of the Parent Licensed Parties as
currently conducted, each of which is in full force and effect in all
respects, and no event has occurred which permits, or upon the giving of
notice or passage of time or both would permit, revocation, non-renewal,
modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Permit that
currently is in effect, the loss of which, either individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. No Parent Entity, nor any of their respective Parent Licensing
Affiliates, has received notice of any investigation or review by any Gaming
Authority or other Governmental Entity with respect to any Parent Entity, or
any of their respective Parent Licensing Affiliates or Parent Management
Principals that is pending, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no investigation

Entity indicated any intention to conduct the same, other than those the
outcome of which would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

 



 

(b) No Parent Licensed Party, and no Parent Licensing Affiliate or Parent
Management Principal of any Parent Licensed Party, has received any written
claim, demand, notice, complaint, court order or administrative order from any
Gaming Authority or other Governmental Entity in the past three (3) years
under, or relating to any violation or possible violation of, any Gaming Law
which did or would be reasonably likely to result in an individual fine or
penalty of $25,000 or more. To the knowledge of Parent, there are no facts
which if known to any Gaming Authority could reasonably be expected to result
in the revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming Approval or other
license, finding of suitability, registration, permit or approval of the
Parent Licensed Parties or any of their respective Parent Licensing Affiliates
or Parent Management Principals. None of the Parent Licensed Parties, and

material claim in writing by any Governmental Entity where Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries does not file a particular type of Tax Return that it is
required to file such Tax Return or may be subject to Tax.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent in the payment of

has received a favorable determination, advisory and/or opinion letter, as
applicable, from the IRS that it is so qualified (or the deadline for

each parcel of real property owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Parent Owned Real Property_ "). Parent (or any Subsidiary of Parent, as
applicable) has good, valid and marketable title to the Parent Owned Real
Property, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens. None of
Parent or any Subsidiary has leased or licensed any portion of the Parent
Owned Real Property. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary is obligated under or a

subject to a lease, sublease, ground lease, license, use agreement and other

with respect to such Parent Leased Real Property (collectively, the " _Parent

knowledge, the other parties thereto, except as such enforcement may be
limited by (A) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
receivership and other Laws of general application affecting the rights and
remedies of creditors, and (B) general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or law. There
does not exist (x) under any Parent Lease any

 



      
 

 



 

material default by Parent or any Subsidiary or, to Parents knowledge, by any
other Person, or (y) any event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default by Parent or any Subsidiary or, to Parents
knowledge, by any other Person;

 



 

(ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, in connection with such Parent Leases, cause a breach or default with
respect to any Parent Lease; and

 



 

(iii) Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent is the holder of the tenants interest
under each of the Parent Leases and neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has

vessel and such list includes all vessels used by Parent and its Subsidiaries

Section 4.21 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.21(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a true and
complete list of all Parent Registered IP. To the knowledge of Parent, no
Parent Registered IP is involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination,
opposition, cancellation or similar proceeding and no such action is or has
been threatened with respect to any of the Parent Registered IP. All Parent
Registered IP is solely and exclusively owned by Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or
claim challenging the validity or enforceability of any Parent Registered IP
that remains pending or unresolved.

 



 

(b) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has taken commercially reasonable
steps to maintain the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including taking commercially reasonable steps to safeguard any
such information that is accessible through computer systems or networks. To
the knowledge of Parent, there has been no misappropriation or unauthorized
access, use, modification or breach of security of Trade Secrets maintained by
or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) To the knowledge of Parent, the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted does not infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual
Property Rights of any third Person in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on

 



      
 

 



 

the business and operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or
claim asserting that any such infringement or misappropriation is occurring or
has occurred, which notice or claim remains pending or unresolved, and that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the business and operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
issued any notice or claim since January 1, 2013 that a third Person is
misappropriating or infringing any Owned Parent Intellectual Property and, to
the knowledge of Parent, no third Person is misappropriating or infringing any
Owned Parent Intellectual Property. No Owned Parent Intellectual Property is
subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree, agreement, or stipulation
restricting or limiting any use or licensing thereof by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

 



 

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, Parent or its
Subsidiaries solely and exclusively own all right, title and interest in and
to (including the sole right to enforce) the Owned Parent Intellectual
Property, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and have
not granted any license, covenant, release, immunity or other right with
respect to any Owned Parent Intellectual Property to any Person other than
non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of business in
connection with marketing and promotional activities. All of the Parent
Intellectual Property that is necessary to the business or operations of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that is not Owned Parent
Intellectual Property is duly and validly licensed to Parent or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid and enforceable Contract. For avoidance of
doubt, the preceding sentence does not constitute a representation or warranty
with respect to non-infringement of Patents of any third Person, which is
addressed separately in _Section 3.21(c)_. Following the Closing, the Final
Surviving Entity will own or have, and will be permitted to exercise, the same
rights that Parent and its Subsidiaries had immediately prior to the Closing
with respect to Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights (other
than off-the-shelf computer programs), in each case that are material to the
operations of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration (other than
ongoing fees, royalties or payments which Parent or its Subsidiaries would
otherwise have been required to pay had this Agreement not been entered into
and the transactions not occurred).

 



 

(e) To the knowledge of Parent, Parent and each Subsidiary has (i) complied in
all material respects with its respective privacy policies and all applicable
Laws relating to privacy and data security, including with respect to the
collection, storage, transmission, transfer, disclosure and use of Personal
Information, and (ii) implemented and maintained a data security plan which
maintains effective and commercially reasonable administrative, technical and
physical safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss, damage and
unauthorized access, use, modification or other misuse. To the knowledge of
Parent, there has been no material loss, damage or unauthorized access, use,
modification or breach of security of Personal Information maintained by or on
behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case that are material to
the operations of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. To the knowledge of Parent, since January 1, 2013, no Person (including
any Governmental Entity) has made any claim or commenced any action with
respect to loss, damage or unauthorized access,

 



      
 

 



 

use, modification or breach of security of Personal Information maintained by
or on behalf of any of Parent or its Subsidiaries in each case that are
material to the operations of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or other transactions
contemplated hereby will, or reasonably would be expected to, result in any
material violation of any privacy policy of Parent and its Subsidiaries or any
applicable Law pertaining to privacy, data security or Personal Information.

 



 

Section 4.22 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except for directors and employment-
related Parent Material Contracts identified in _Section 4.178 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter_, as of the date hereof, no executive officer or director of
Parent (a) is a party to any Parent Material Contract with, or binding upon,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, (b) has any interest in any property owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (c) has engaged in any of the foregoing transactions within
the last twelve (12) months.

other Person, other than J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is entitled to any
brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Parent Entities. Parent has provided
to the Company a complete and correct copy of all contracts between Parent and
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC pursuant to which J.P. Morgan Securities LLC would
be entitled to any payment relating to the Mergers or other transactions
contemplated herein or otherwise.

 



 

Section 4.25 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has
delivered to the Parent Board its written opinion (or oral opinion to be
confirmed in writing), dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial
point of view, to Parent.

 



 

Section 4.26 _Solvency of Parent_. Immediately following the Effective Time
and after giving effect to the Mergers and taking into account the financing
necessary in order to consummate the Mergers, Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries will not (i) be insolvent (either because their respective
financial conditions are such that the sum of their debts is greater than the
fair market value of their assets or because the fair saleable value of their
assets is less than the amount required to pay their probable liability on
their existing debts as such debts mature); (ii) have unreasonably small
capital with which to engage in the Business; or (iii) have incurred, nor have
intended to incur or believe they have incurred, debts beyond their ability to
pay such debts as such debts become due.

 



 

Section 4.27 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete
and correct copy of an executed Commitment Letter (including all exhibits,
annexes, schedules and term sheets and the executed fee letters attached
thereto or contemplated thereby (provided, that provisions in the fee letters
or Commitment Letter relating solely to fees and economic terms

 



      
 

 



 

agreed to by the parties may be redacted (none of which redacted provisions
adversely affect the availability of or impose additional conditions on, the
availability of the Debt Financing at the Closing)), dated as of September 19,
2016 (such Commitment Letter as the same may be amended or replaced pursuant
to, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, _Section 5.18_, is
referred to herein as the "Debt Financing Commitment"), among Parent and
Lender, pursuant to which, among other things, Lender has agreed, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Debt Financing Commitment, to provide or cause
to be provided, the financing commitments specified in _Section 4.27 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter_, the proceeds of which (including proceeds of any
notes offering contemplated thereby) are to be used to fund the Cash
Consideration, refinance outstanding indebtedness of the Company and pay
transaction fees and expenses. The financing commitments contemplated under
the Debt Financing Commitment, as amended or replaced in compliance with
_Section 5.18_, are referred to herein, individually and collectively, as the
"Debt Financing". Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees in connection with the Debt Financing Commitment that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof and, to the knowledge of Parent, the Debt Financing
Commitment is, as of the date hereof, in full force and effect. The Debt
Financing Commitment is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and,
to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. The Debt Financing
Commitment (or any Debt Financing contemplated thereunder) has not been or
will not be amended or modified, except as consistent with _Section 5.18_,
and, as of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment has not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, (i) no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under the Debt Financing
Commitment, and (ii) subject to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III hereof, the performance by
the Company and its Subsidiaries of their obligations contained in this
Agreement and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_
and _Section 6.2_ hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any material term or condition of closing
to be satisfied by the Debt Financing Commitment on or prior to the Closing
Date. As of the date hereof, there are no conditions precedent related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set
forth in Section 5 and Annex III of the Debt Financing Commitment. As of the
date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements (except for customary fee letters, which do not contain
provisions that impose any additional conditions to the funding of the Debt
Financing not otherwise set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment) related to
the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing. The aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, together with the available
cash of Parent and the Company on the Closing Date (if any) and any
Alternative Financing (if any), will be sufficient for the Parent Entities to
consummate the Mergers upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.4 _Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall

sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and
cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its
or their Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to
the date hereof with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or
advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such
information.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(a)_ , prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through any
Representative, may, subject to _Section 5.4(c)_ (i) participate in
negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made (and not
withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal in writing
that the Company Board believes in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Company Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to
such third party non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement (a copy of
which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly provided (but in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours of the execution thereof) for informational
purposes only to Parent), (iii) following receipt of and on account of a
Superior Company Proposal, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
(iv) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the
Company to take (which order remains unstayed), but in each case referred to
in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), only if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, any request
for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party. In such notice, the
Company shall identify the third party making, and details of the status and
material terms and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a
current basis (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of any change
thereto), of the material terms of any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall
provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of any
meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the
members of the Company Board) at which the Company Board is reasonably
expected to consider any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent with any material non-public information concerning
the Companys business, present or future performance, financial condition or
results of operations provided to any third party that has not been previously
provided to Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.4(d)_ , the Company Board shall not
make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any
Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval:

 



 

(i) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to a Superior Company Proposal or cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into (or permit or cause any Subsidiary of the
Company to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement if: (A) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company promptly
notifies Parent, in writing, at least five (5) days (the " _Superior Company
Proposal Notice Period_ ") before taking such action of its intention to do
so, which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board intends to declare a Superior
Company Proposal and that the Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to terminate this Agreement
in order to enter into (or permit or cause any Subsidiary of the Company to
enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement; (C) the Company attaches to such
notice the most current version of the proposed agreement (which version shall
be updated on a prompt basis if and to the extent there are any subsequent
material changes to such agreement) and the identity of the third party making
such Superior Company Proposal; (D) the Company negotiates, and uses its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent
(to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith during the Superior Company
Proposal Notice Period to make adjustments with respect to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (it being agreed that in the event that, after
commencement of the Superior Company Proposal Notice Period, if there is any
material revision to the terms of a Superior Company Proposal, including any
revision in price, the Superior Company Proposal Notice Period shall be
extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two (2) days remain in the
Superior Company Proposal Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company
notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there
may be multiple extensions)); and (E) at or after 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on
the last day of the Superior Company Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Company Proposal after taking into account any
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed by Parent in
writing during the Superior Company Proposal Notice Period;

 



 

(ii) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to a Company Intervening Event if: (A) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in
writing, at least five (5) days (the " _Company Intervening Event Notice
Period_ ") before taking such action of its intention to do so, which notice
shall specify the reasons therefor; (C) the Company (1) negotiates, and uses
its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to negotiate, with
Parent (to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith during the Company
Intervening Event Notice Period to make adjustments with respect to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board no longer
determines that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation

 



      
 

 



 

Change in response to such Company Intervening Event would be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (2) permits
Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board
regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the
extent Parent desires to make such presentation) and (D) at or after 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the last day of the Company Intervening Event Notice Period,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, that a failure to make such a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law after taking into account any
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed by Parent in
writing during the Company Intervening Event Notice Period.

 



 

(e) (i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prevent the Company
Board from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act and (ii) no disclosure that the Company Board determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it or the Company is
required to make under applicable Law will constitute a violation of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement and Registration Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event no later than forty-five (45) days thereafter, (i)
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file (with the
reasonable cooperation of the Company) with the SEC the Registration
Statement, which will include the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
constitute part of the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective by the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective
as long as necessary to consummate the Mergers, the Share Issuance and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company will cause the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Parents stockholders and the
Companys stockholders, respectively, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC under the
Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under
any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Share Issuance,
and each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information concerning it
and its stockholders, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing or mailing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, without the others prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be
considered by the other party in good faith); _provided_ , _however_ , that at
the Companys request, Parent shall reasonably cooperate in amending or
supplementing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement
(including by incorporation by reference) to include (A) a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, (B) a statement of the reason of the Company Board for
making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (C) a factually accurate
statement by the Company that describes the

 



      
 

 



 

Companys receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the terms of such
proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, and (D)
additional information reasonably related to the foregoing. Parent shall take
any action necessary to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
in connection with the Share Issuance to be authorized for listing on NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all
written comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement and advise the other party of any oral comments with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC
with respect to the Registration Statement. Parent or the Company, as
applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral or written
notice of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information, or the threat or issuance of any stop
order or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any written
communication from the SEC or any state securities commission relating to any
such matter and shall use reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order
or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by
Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
so that any of such documents would not include a misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and Parent.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, the Company shall take all action
necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Constituent Documents to
duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") and not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting except (i) to the extent required by applicable Law (including to
provide additional disclosure to the stockholders of the Company on account of
a Company Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) solicit additional votes in favor of
adoption of this Agreement if sufficient votes to constitute the Company
Stockholder Approval have not been obtained; _provided_ that, unless

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise agreed by the parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting may not be
postponed or adjourned to a date that is the earlier of (x) twenty-five (25)
days after the date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally
scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable
Law) and (y) three (3) Business Days prior to the Termination Date. The
Company will, except in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
through the Company Board, recommend that its stockholders adopt this
Agreement and will use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders required by the rules of NASDAQ or applicable Laws to obtain such
approvals.

 



 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, Parent shall take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable Laws and Parents articles of incorporation and
bylaws to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval (the " _Parent
Stockholders Meeting_ ") and not postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders
Meeting except to the extent required by applicable Law or to solicit
additional proxies and votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement if
sufficient votes to constitute the Parent Stockholder Approval have not been
obtained; _provided_ that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Parent
Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is the
earlier of (x) twenty-five (25) days after the date for which the Parent
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law) and (y) three (3) Business Days
prior to the Termination Date. Parent will, through the Parent Board,
recommend that its stockholders approve the Share Issuance and will use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the Share Issuance and to take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of NASDAQ
or other applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

 



 

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting
on the same date and at the same time.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, each of Parent and the
Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Subsidiaries and its Representatives to, afford to the other party reasonable
access during normal business hours, consistent with applicable Law, to its
officers, key management employees, properties, offices, other facilities and
books and records, and shall promptly furnish the other party with all
financial, operating and other data and information as such party shall
reasonably request in writing (it being agreed, however, that the foregoing
shall not permit either party or its officers, employees or representatives to
conduct any environmental testing or sampling or other invasive testing). Each
of Parent and the Company shall furnish to the other party and its
Representatives such available financial and operating data, including any
unaudited financial statements, as the other party may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be

 



      
 

 



 

conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of any party or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees
of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, of their normal duties. Neither Parent, the Company nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any agreement
with any third party, (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-
client or other privilege held by such party or (iii) otherwise violate any
applicable Law, including Gaming Laws.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company and each of their Subsidiaries will hold
and treat, and will cause their respective Representatives to hold and treat,
in confidence all documents and information concerning the other party
furnished to it, its Subsidiaries and/or its Representatives in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any and all
information or documents furnished in accordance with the confidentiality
letter agreement, dated July 7, 2016, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ")), which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each
other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law (including under any Antitrust Law and under any applicable
Gaming Law) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at
the earliest practicable date, including: (i) causing the preparation and
filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to

vacating, lifting, reversing or overturning any injunction, decree, ruling,
order or other action of any Governmental Entity that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_
, each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly
as practicable, and in any event by no later than fifteen (15) Business Days
from the date of this Agreement, an appropriate Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall pay all of its
own filing fees and other charges for the filings required under the HSR Act
with respect to it and its Subsidiaries.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_

applications and supporting documents necessary to obtain all required Gaming
Approvals as promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than thirty
(30) days from the date of this Agreement.

information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
but not limited to a Request for Additional Information or Documentary
Material under the HSR Act or requests for supporting, supplemental, or
additional documentation from any Gaming Authorities, then such party shall in
good faith make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other parties, a response which is, at a minimum,
in substantial compliance with such request.

by any party under any Antitrust Law or applicable Gaming Law and liaising
with each other in relation to each step of the procedure before the relevant
Governmental Entities and as to the contents of all communications with such

Governmental Entity, no party will make any written communication with any
Governmental Entity in relation to the transactions contemplated hereunder
without first providing the other parties with a copy of such communication in
draft form and giving such other parties a reasonable opportunity to discuss
its content before it is filed with the relevant Governmental Entities, and
such first party shall consider all reasonable comments timely made by the
other parties in this respect; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be
required to provide the other parties with any written communications with any

substantive meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental Entity

party has a

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable basis to object to the presence of the other parties at any such
meetings or appearances;

 



 

(iv) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions

applicable Gaming Laws; and

 



 

(v) without prejudice to any rights of the parties hereunder, consulting and
cooperating in all respects with the other in defending all lawsuits and other
proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) In addition, Parent and the Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all
other action and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper
or advisable under all Antitrust Laws and/or applicable Gaming Laws to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly
as practicable the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and obtain
all Permits and all other approvals and any other consents required to be
obtained in order for the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

(g) No actions taken pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially, competitively and/or personal
sensitive information and materials of a party will be provided to the other
parties on an outside counsel-only basis, provided that the parties shall
cooperate to enable appropriate communications to be made available to the
other party with respect to such commercially or competitively sensitive
information redacted if necessary.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Compensation and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) If mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, the Company, shall one (1)
Business Day prior to the Effective Time, adopt resolutions terminating any
Company Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the date the Company and Parent become members of the same
controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code),
which Parent and the Company have determined should be terminated prior to the
Effective Time. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
the reasonable approval of Parent, and the Company shall provide evidence that
such resolutions have been adopted by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable.

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time until December 31, 2017, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Final Surviving Entity or any of its
Subsidiaries) to, offer Company Employees, to the extent they remain employed
by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Final Surviving Entity or any of
its Subsidiaries), compensation (including wages, salaries and cash bonus
opportunities) and other employee benefits (excluding equity-based or equity-
linked compensation or benefits, and excluding any pension or other retiree
benefits)

 



      
 

 



 

which are not materially less favorable in the aggregate than those provided
to such employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or, if less,
than those offered to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries).

 



 

(c) With respect to employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements that are established or maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Final Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries) from and after the
Effective Date (the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "), to the extent applicable (i)
Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) shall be given credit for
their service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes,
including eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual (but not
benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan), to the same extent such
service was taken into account by the Company and its Subsidiaries under a
corresponding Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of
any pre-existing condition limitations shall be waived for Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) (provided that in the case of any insured
arrangement such waivers shall be subject to the consent of the applicable
insurer and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
consent) and (iii) all Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) shall
be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Company Plan during the
same period for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out of pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the applicable Parent Benefit Plans (provided that in the case
of any insured arrangement such credit shall be subject to the consent of the
applicable insurer and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such consent). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.8(c)_ , service and other amounts shall not be credited to Company
Employees (or their eligible dependents) to the extent the crediting of such
service or other amounts would result in the duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) As of the Effective Time, the Final Surviving Entity and/or its applicable
Subsidiaries shall continue as a party to, as required and by operation of Law
(and, to the extent required by an applicable agreement or arrangement, Parent
shall cause the Final Surviving Entity and/or its applicable Subsidiaries) to
assume and agree to perform in accordance with their terms), all employment,
consulting, collective bargaining, severance, bonus, retention, change in
control, incentive and other compensation agreements and arrangements existing
as of the Effective Time between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any director, officer or employee thereof or covering Company Employees (or
former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Former Company
Employees_ ")) or in which Company Employees (or Former Company Employees) are
eligible to participate; provided that any such agreements or arrangements
entered into after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries were entered into in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including this _Section 5.7_ (a)),
express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or
limit the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement, or arrangement after the Effective Time, (iii) is intended
to confer or shall confer upon any current or former employee any right to
employment or continue employment, or constitute or create an employment
agreement with any employee,

 



      
 

 



 

or (iv) is intended to confer or shall confer upon any individual or any legal
representative of any individual (including employee, retirees, or dependents
or benefits of employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary
of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and Parent and their respective boards of
directors shall take such commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary
to render such Law inapplicable to all of the foregoing or to ensure that the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter
of such communication could be material to the Company or Parent, (b) any
Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
(c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause
or result in any of the conditions to the Mergers set forth in _Article VI_
not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially
delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_
shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision
of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party receiving
such notice; _provided_ _further_ , that failure to give prompt notice
pursuant to clause (c) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the
Mergers set forth in _Article VI_ except to the extent that the underlying
fact or circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a
failure.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer or director of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), as
applicable against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i)
the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, fiduciary
or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
each

 



      
 

 



 

as at the date hereof (collectively, the " _Constituent Documents_ "). In the
event of any such Action, (A) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from Parent or
the Final Surviving Entity, as applicable, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law and the applicable Constituent Documents; _provided_ that
any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only
to the extent required by applicable law or the Constituent Documents, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that
such person is not entitled to indemnification, (B) none of Parent or the
Final Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any proceeding or threatened Action (and in which indemnification
could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (C)
Parent and the Final Surviving Entity shall cooperate in the defense of any
such matter. Parent and the Final Surviving Entity shall be jointly and
severally liable for the obligation to provide indemnification to the
Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or in
any indemnification agreement (or form thereof) identified in _Section 5.11(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter_ and in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and continue in full force and effect,
and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that
would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, or cause to be provided
substitute policies or purchase or cause the Company to purchase a "tail
policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the
aggregate to the Indemnified Parties than such policy with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess
of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but
in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for
such amount. All such policies, including any substitute policies, shall be
issued by carriers rated A, XII or higher by A.M. Best Company. At the
Companys option, it may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6) year
prepaid, non-revocable and non-cancellable tail policy on terms and conditions
(in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid tail policy has been
obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Final
Surviving Entity.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

 



 

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall
survive the consummation of the Mergers and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Final Surviving Entity or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Final Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.11_.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Public Announcements_. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any public
announcement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Parent and the
Company agree that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of
this Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent and the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may make public
statements in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences so long as such statements are
substantially consistent with press releases, public disclosures or public
statements previously issued or made by Parent or the Company, as applicable.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Obligations of Merger Subs and Parent; Consents of Parent_.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B
to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement. Immediately
following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver
(a) a written consent in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub A
and (b) a written consent in its capacity as the sole Member of Merger Sub B,
in each case, adopting this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.14 _Company Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, timely deliver all
notices and take all other administrative actions required to facilitate (i)
the termination of commitments, repayment in full of all outstanding loans or
other obligations, release of any Liens securing such loans or obligations and
guarantees in connection therewith, and replacement of or cash
collateralization of any issued letters of credit in respect of that certain
Credit Agreement, dated as of July 26, 2007 among Ibis, the Lenders listed
therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent(as
amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated February 17,

Documents dated March 25, 2011, that certain Third Amendment to Credit
Agreement dated November 21, 2012, that certain Fourth Amendment to Credit
Agreement and Amendments to Loan Documents dated April 19, 2013, that certain
Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement dated July 2, 2013, that certain Sixth
Amendment to Credit Agreement dated October 29, 2014, and as may be further
amended from time to time, the " _Company Credit Agreement_ ," and such
termination and repayment, the " _Company Credit Agreement Payoff_ ") on the
Closing Date and (ii) to the extent reasonably requested in writing by any of
the Parent Entities, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date with respect to any indebtedness incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date hereof in compliance with _Section 5.1(b)(viii)_
(other than under the Company Credit Agreement or guarantees of the Company
Notes) (it being understood that the Company shall promptly and in any event
no later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date notify
Parent in writing of the amount of any such indebtedness incurred or to be
incurred and expected to be outstanding on the Closing Date), repayment in
full of all obligations in respect of such indebtedness and release of any
Liens securing such indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith, in
each case, on the Closing Date. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts
to deliver to the Parent Entities no later than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date payoff letters with respect to the Company Credit
Agreement and, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in writing no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, any indebtedness
incurred by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the date hereof in
compliance with _Section 5.1(b)(viii)_ (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form
and substance customary for transactions of this type, from the persons, or
the applicable agent on behalf of the persons, to which such indebtedness is
owed, which Payoff Letters together with any related release documentation
shall, among other things, include the payoff amount and provide for Liens
(and guarantees), if any, granted in connection therewith relating to the
assets, rights and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing
such indebtedness and any other obligations secured thereby, upon the payment
of the amount set forth in the applicable Payoff Letter on or prior to the
Closing Date, to be released and terminated.

 



 

(b) On the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) issue one or more notices of
redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
Companys 5.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the " _5.875% Notes_ ") and 8.875%
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the " _8.875% Notes_ ," and together with
the 5.875% Notes, the " _Company Notes_ "), pursuant to the Note Indentures in
order to effect a redemption of the Company Notes as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date and (ii) provide any other cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent (which shall not require the payment of funds by the
Company or its Subsidiaries towards

 



      
 

 



 

the Discharge) to facilitate the redemption of the Company Notes on the
redemption date and the satisfaction and discharge of such Company Notes
pursuant to the Note Indentures effective as of the Effective Time. The
Company shall not be required to take any action, to the extent it determines,
after consultation with outside counsel, that such action would reasonably be
expected to violate the terms of any Contract to which it is a party.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, any costs incurred or liabilities
arising out of or in connection with any Discharge shall be borne by Parent.

 



 

(c) Subject to the Companys compliance with _Section 5.14(a)_ and _(b)_ ,
Parent shall cause (i) the Company Credit Agreement Payoff to occur on the
Closing Date and (ii) the Discharge of all of the Company Notes to be
consummated on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and
Parent agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Company
Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Mergers, both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject
to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares
of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares,
Company PSUs and Company RSUs into Parent Common Stock and Parent options,
restricted shares, performance stock units and restricted stock units, as the
case may be, in the Mergers, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose
agree to the provisions of this _Section 5.15_. Assuming the Company delivers
to Parent in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate
information regarding those officers and directors of the Company who will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
(the " _Company Insiders_ "), the number of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company PSUs and Company
RSUs held by each such Company Insider expected to be exchanged in the
Mergers, Parent Board, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective
Time, adopt a resolution providing in substance that the receipt by the
Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock, Parent options, and Parent restricted
stock units, deferred stock units and phantom units, in exchange for Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company PSUs
and Company RSUs, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, are approved by Parent Board or by such committee thereof, and
are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to
ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Tax Matters_. During the period up to the Closing, the Company
and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to, timely file
all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of each such entity,
timely pay all Taxes due and payable, accrue a reserve in the books and
records and financial statements of any such entity for all Taxes payable but
not yet due, and promptly notify the other of any actions pending against or
with respect to it or any of its subsidiaries in respect of any Tax. After the
Closing, each party to this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

shall cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate,
with each others agents, including accountants and legal counsel, in
connection with Tax matters relating to the Company, Parent, and any of their
Subsidiaries, including the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns,
examination of Tax Returns, and any administrative or judicial proceedings in
respect of Taxes assessed or proposed to be assessed. The parties hereto
intend that the Mergers, taken together, be treated as a transaction
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. From and after
the date of this Agreement, each party hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify as part of a reorganization
under Section 368 of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
be taken which action or failure to act could prevent the Mergers from
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. The Company and
Parent shall cooperate and provide any certifications or representations
reasonably required by counsel for the Company and counsel for Parent in
providing the opinions described in _Section 6.2(e)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_
hereof, including executing and delivering to each such counsel certificates
substantially in the forms set forth on _Section 6.2(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ and _Section 6.3(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter_ at
such time or times as reasonably requested by each such counsel. Following the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries knowingly shall
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could
prevent the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a reorganization under
Section 368 of the Code.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with
the opportunity to participate in the Companys defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Mergers. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to
settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement
that contemplates any equitable relief or that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to provide to the Parent Entities such cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent that is reasonable or customary in connection with the
Debt Financing (provided that such requested cooperation is consistent with
applicable Law and does not materially interfere with the operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating
agencies as reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise reasonably
cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent Entities and the Parent
Financing Sources for the Debt Financing; (ii) providing all reasonably
requested assistance with the preparation of customary materials for rating
agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that any such memoranda or
prospectuses may, at the election of the Parent Entities, contain disclosure
and financial statements with respect to the Company or the Final Surviving

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required, under the provisions of

provide any cooperation to the extent that it would materially interfere with
the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) to
enter into any instrument or Contract, or agree to any change or modification
to any instrument or Contract or take any action with respect to its existing
Indebtedness (other than giving required notices of intent to terminate hedge
agreements and repay LIBOR loans), prior to the occurrence of the Effective
Time that would be effective if the Effective Time does not occur, (iii) to
provide any cooperation, or take any action, that would cause the Company to
breach any provision or fail to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement or cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article VI_ to fail
to be satisfied, (iv) to cause any of their respective boards of directors (or
equivalent bodies) to adopt any resolution, grant any approval or
authorization or otherwise take any corporate or similar action in each case
for the purpose of approving the Debt Financing or (v) to pay any commitment
or other similar fee in respect of the Debt Financing prior to the Effective
Time that is not advanced or substantially simultaneously reimbursed by
Parent. Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all

Company and the Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 5.18_. Nothing
contained in this Section or otherwise shall require the Company to be an

representatives and advisors as required in connection with the Debt Financing

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete the Debt
Financing on or before the Closing Date, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment, or on other
terms reasonably acceptable to Parent and not in violation of this _Section
5.18_ and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to such
Debt Financing in such definitive agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Parent Entities have raised through alternative sources (an " _Alternative
Financing_ ") funds sufficient to meet their obligations to pay the Merger
Consideration, refinance any outstanding indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and pay all fees and expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in connection with the Mergers, the Debt Financing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement the Parent Entities shall have no obligation to
arrange any such Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in such
respective Debt Financing Commitment or otherwise so long as (A) Parent shall
promptly notify the Company of any such Alternative Financing, and (B) the
terms of such Alternative Financing (x) are not materially less favorable to
Parent or the Company than the Debt Financing and (y) would not reasonably be
expected to cause any delay in the consummation of the Mergers as compared to
the Debt Financing (it being understood and agreed that any Alternative
Financing shall not include the issuance of Parent Common Stock or Parent
options or other rights to acquire Parent Common Stock). In the event any
portion of the Debt Financing, or if applicable any Alternative Financing,
becomes unavailable, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain bridge financing,
alternative debt financing or equity financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to meet the Parent Entities obligations to pay the Merger
Consideration, refinance any outstanding indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and pay all fees and expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in connection with the Mergers, the Debt Financing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, it is understood and agreed that reasonable best efforts of
Parent contemplated by this _Section 5.18(c)_ shall be deemed to require
Parent to bring enforcement actions to cause the applicable lenders to provide
the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing, as applicable.

 



 

Except as provided elsewhere in this _Section 5.18_ , nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit any Parent Entity from entering into agreements
relating to the Debt Financing or the operation of any Parent Entity or, as of
the Effective Time, the Final Surviving Entity, including adding equity
providers or operating partners (so long as any such agreements or entering
into such agreements would not reasonably be expected to materially impair or
delay the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

(including with respect to approvals required in connection therewith under
any applicable Gaming Laws)).

 



 

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not
be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld, no Parent Entity shall
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, or replace, the Debt Financing Commitment if such
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement would reasonably be expected to
(i) delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) modify the conditions contained in the
Debt Financing Commitment (the " _Debt Financing Conditions_ ") or create any
new condition to the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing, as
applicable, (other than the Debt Financing Conditions as in effect on the date
hereof), (iii) reduce the net cash proceeds of the Debt Financing, including
any reduction in the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing, (iv)
change the date for termination and/or expiration of the Debt Financing
Commitment to an earlier date or (v) adversely impact the ability of any
Parent Entity to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt
Financing Commitment prior to the Closing. Without the prior written consent
of the Company, no Parent Entity shall permit any assignment of rights or
obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment, provided that the Lender may
syndicate the Debt Financing so long as the Lender retains and remains
obligated to fund its commitment under the Debt Financing until the Debt
Financing is fully funded by the designated assignees and the syndicated
sources of funding for the Debt Financing. Parent shall promptly provide the
Company written notice of any amendment or modification relating to the Debt
Financing Commitment that does not require consent pursuant to _Section
5.18(c)_.

 



 

(e) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice: (i) of the receipt of any
written notice from the Lender or any other source of Debt Financing with
respect to any termination or repudiation of the Debt Financing Commitment by
the Lender or any such source of Debt Financing or (ii) if for any reason any
portion of the Debt Financing actually becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment; _provided_ , that
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to
disclose any information pursuant to this sentence to the extent that (x) such
information is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege (but only if
such privilege is asserted in good faith) or (y) the disclosure of which would
be prohibited or restricted by applicable Law.

Company Stockholder Approval or (y) _Section 7.2(e)_ and, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), (A) prior to such termination (in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ ), the breach or failure to perform
giving rise to Parents right to terminate (in the case of termination
pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ ) or the Company Stockholders Meeting (in the
case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.2(e)_ ), a Company Acquisition
Proposal shall (1) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_
or _Section 7.2(e)_ , have been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or (2) in
the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ , have been publicly

termination, a fee in an amount equal to the Financing Failure Fee.

 



 

(e) Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.6_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay
any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ , and, in

 



      
 

 



 

order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in
a judgment against such party for the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.6_
, such party shall pay other party its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to the applicable
provisions of this _Section 7.6_ from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. The sole remedy for any termination described in this _Section 7.6_
shall be the payment of the Termination Fee or the Financing Failure Fee, as
applicable, and neither Parent nor the Company shall pay any such fee on more
than one occasion. The Company acknowledges and agrees that none of the Parent
Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company, its
Affiliates or any of their respective equity holders or representatives
