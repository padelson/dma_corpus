and 2(iv) and any other Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on

such event. Nothing in this _Section 2.3_ shall be construed to permit any
Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision of this Agreement.

 **ARTICLE 3** ** 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME**

 



 

 **Section 3.1** **_Responsibilities of Allergan in Respect of the Scheme_**.
Allergan shall:

 



 

(a) (i) be responsible for the preparation of a proxy statement to be sent to
the Allergan Shareholders in connection with the matters to be submitted at
the Court Meeting and the EGM (such proxy statement, as amended or
supplemented, the " **Proxy Statement** ") and the Scheme Document and all
other documentation necessary to effect the Scheme and to convene the EGM and
Court Meeting, (ii) provide AbbVie with drafts of the Proxy Statement and the
Scheme Document and afford AbbVie reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Proxy Statement and the Scheme Document and such other documents and
shall consider such comments in good faith and (iii) subject to the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, cause the Proxy Statement and the Scheme Document to be filed with the
SEC and the Panel (in accordance with Rule 41.1(b) of the Takeover Rules);

 



 

(b) for the purpose of implementing the Scheme, instruct a barrister (of
senior counsel standing) and provide AbbVie and its Representatives with the
opportunity to attend any meetings with such barrister to discuss matters
pertaining to the Scheme and any issues arising in connection with it (except
to the extent the barrister is to advise on matters relating to the fiduciary
duties of the directors of Allergan or their responsibilities under the
Takeover Rules);

 



 

(c) as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify AbbVie upon the receipt of
any comments from the Panel or the SEC on, or any request from the Panel or
the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement, the Scheme
Document, the Allergan Equity Award Holder Proposal and the related forms of
proxy and provide AbbVie with copies of all material written correspondence
between it and its Representatives and the Panel and/or the SEC relating to
such documents;

 



 

(d) use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and resolve all Panel and
SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Scheme Document as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof;

 



 

(e) as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify AbbVie of any other matter
of which it becomes aware which would reasonably be expected to materially
delay or prevent filing of the Proxy Statement or the Scheme Document with the
SEC and the Panel, as applicable, or implementation of the Scheme as the case
may be;

 



 

(f) prior to filing or the despatch of any amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or the Scheme Document requested by the Panel or the SEC, or
responding in writing to any comments of the Panel or the SEC with respect
thereto, Allergan shall provide AbbVie with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response and consider in good faith such
comments;

 



 

(g) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date on which the SEC confirms that it will not review
the Proxy Statement or that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement;

 



     

 

 



 

(h) to the extent that clearance of the Proxy Statement or the Scheme Document
by the Panel might require that waivers and/or derogations in respect of the
Takeover Rules be sought and obtained from the Panel, make a submission for
(and use reasonable best efforts to have approved) such waiver or derogation
as promptly as reasonably practicable after having provided AbbVie with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such submission and
considering in good faith such comments;

 



 

(i) provide AbbVie with drafts of any and all pleadings, affidavits, petitions
and other filings prepared by Allergan for submission to the High Court in
connection with the Scheme prior to their filing, and afford AbbVie reasonable
opportunities to review and comment on all such documents and consider in good
faith such comments;

 



 

(j) as promptly as reasonably practicable (taking into account any
requirements of the Panel with respect to the Scheme Document and the SEC
review (if any) with respect to the Proxy Statement, that must be satisfied
prior to the release of the Scheme Document), make all necessary applications
to the High Court in connection with the implementation of the Scheme
(including issuing appropriate proceedings requesting the High Court to give
directions under Section 450(5) of the Act as to what are the appropriate
meetings to be held and to order that the Court Meeting be convened as
promptly as is reasonably practicable following the Rule 2.5 Announcement and
the SEC review (if any) of the Proxy Statement by the SEC), and to use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the hearing of such proceedings occurs
as promptly as is reasonably practicable in order to facilitate the despatch
of the Scheme Document and seek such directions of the High Court as it
considers necessary or desirable in connection with such Court Meeting and
thereafter comply with such directions;

 



 

(k) procure the publication of the requisite advertisements and despatch of
the Scheme Document (in a form acceptable to the Panel), Proxy Statement and
the related forms of proxy for the use at the Court Meeting and the EGM (the
form of which shall be agreed between the Parties, acting reasonably) (i) to
Allergan Shareholders on the register of members of Allergan on the record
date as agreed with the High Court, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after securing approval of the High Court to despatch such documents, and (ii)
to the holders of the Allergan Options and the Allergan Share Awards as of
such date, for information only, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
securing approval of the High Court to despatch such documents, and thereafter
shall publish and/or post such other documents and information (the form of
which shall be agreed between the Parties, acting reasonably) as the High
Court and/or the Panel may approve or direct from time to time;

 



 

(l) unless the Allergan Board has effected an Allergan Change of
Recommendation pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.3_, and subject
to the obligations of the Allergan Board under the Takeover Rules, procure
that the Proxy Statement and the Scheme Document include the Scheme
Recommendation;

 



 

(m) include in the Scheme Document a notice convening the EGM to be held
immediately following the Court Meeting to consider and, if thought fit,
approve the EGM Resolutions;

 



     

 

 



 

(n) prior to the Court Meeting, keep AbbVie reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis (in each case to the extent Allergan reasonably has
access to such information) of the number of proxy votes received in respect
of resolutions to be proposed at the Court Meeting and/or the EGM, and in any
event provide such number promptly upon the request of AbbVie or its
Representatives and, unless the Allergan Board has effected an Allergan Change
of Recommendation pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.3_, use
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies as may be necessary to pass the
Resolutions at the Court Meeting and/or the EGM;

 



 

(o) notwithstanding any Allergan Change of Recommendation, unless this
Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to and in accordance with
_Article 9_, hold the Court Meeting and the EGM on the date set out in the
Scheme Document, or such later date as may be agreed in writing by the Parties
(such agreements not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and
in such a manner as shall be approved, if necessary by the High Court and/or
the Panel, and propose the Resolutions without any amendments, unless such
amendments have been agreed to in writing by AbbVie, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;

 



 

(p) subject to the terms of this Agreement, afford all such cooperation and
assistance as may reasonably be requested of it by AbbVie in respect of the
preparation and verification of any document or in connection with any
Clearance or confirmation required for the implementation of the Scheme,
including the provision to AbbVie in a timely manner of such information and
confirmations relating to it, its Subsidiaries and any of its or their
respective directors or employees as AbbVie may reasonably request;

 



 

(q) assume responsibility for the information relating to it or any of its
Subsidiaries contained in the Scheme Document, the Proxy Statement or any
other document sent to Allergan Shareholders or filed with the High Court or
in any announcement;

 



 

(r) review and provide comments (if any) in a reasonably timely manner on all
documentation submitted to it by AbbVie;

 



 

(s) following the Court Meeting and EGM, assuming the Resolutions are duly
passed (including by the requisite majorities required under Section 453 of
the Act in the case of the Court Meeting) and all other Conditions are
satisfied or, in the sole discretion of the applicable Party, waived (where
permissible under the terms of the Rule 2.5 Announcement and/or the Scheme
Document) (with the exception of Conditions 2(iii) and 2(iv) and any other
Conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied on the Sanction Date, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible under the provisions
of the Rule 2.5 Announcement and/or the Scheme Document) of such Conditions),
take all necessary steps on the part of Allergan to prepare and issue, serve
and lodge all such court documents as are required to seek the sanction of the
High Court to the Scheme as soon as possible thereafter;

 



 

(t) give such undertakings as are required by the High Court in connection
with the Scheme as are reasonably necessary or desirable to implement the
Scheme; and

 



     

 

 



 

(u) keep AbbVie reasonably informed as to the performance of the obligations
and responsibilities required of Allergan pursuant to the Scheme.

 



 

 **Section 3.2** **_Responsibilities of AbbVie and Acquirer Sub in Respect of
the Scheme_**. AbbVie and Acquirer Sub shall:

 



 

(a) either (i) instruct counsel to appear on its behalf at the Court Hearing
and undertake to the High Court to be bound by the terms of the Scheme
(including the issuance of the Share Consideration pursuant thereto) insofar
as it relates to AbbVie or Acquirer Sub, or (ii) provide a written undertaking
to the High Court to be bound by the terms of the Scheme (including the
issuance of the Share Consideration pursuant thereto) insofar as it relates to
AbbVie or Acquirer Sub;

 



 

(b) if, and to the extent that, it or any of its Concert Parties owns or is
interested in Allergan Shares, exercise all of its rights and, insofar as lies
within its powers, procure that each of its Concert Parties shall exercise all
of their respective rights, in respect of such Allergan Shares so as to
implement, and otherwise support the implementation of, the Scheme, including
by voting (and, in respect of interests in Allergan held via contracts for
difference or other derivative instruments, insofar as lies within its powers,
procuring that instructions are given to the holder of the underlying Allergan
Shares to vote) in favor of the Resolutions or, if required by Law, the High
Court or the Takeover Rules, refraining from voting, at any Court Meeting
and/or EGM as the case may be;

 



 

(c) keep Allergan reasonably informed as to the performance of the obligations
and responsibilities required of AbbVie and Acquirer Sub pursuant to the
Scheme;

 



 

(d) subject to the terms of this Agreement (including _Section 7.2_ hereof)
and the Scheme, afford all such cooperation and assistance as may reasonably
be requested of it by Allergan in respect of the preparation and verification
of any document or in connection with any Clearance or confirmation required
for the implementation of the Scheme, including the provision to Allergan in a
timely manner of such information and confirmations relating to it, its
Subsidiaries and any of its or their respective directors or employees as
Allergan may reasonably request (including for the purposes of preparing the
Scheme Document);

 



 

(e) assume responsibility for the information relating to it or any of its
Subsidiaries contained in the Scheme Document, the Proxy Statement or any
other document sent to Allergan Shareholders or filed with the High Court or
in any announcement;

 



 

(f) review and provide comments (if any) in a reasonably timely manner on all
documentation submitted to it by Allergan;

 



 

(g) to the extent that clearance of the Proxy Statement or the Scheme Document
by the Panel might require that waivers and/or derogations in respect of the
Takeover Rules be sought and obtained from the Panel, make a submission for
(and use reasonable best efforts to have approved) such waiver or derogation
as promptly as reasonably practicable after having provided Allergan with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such submission and
considering in good faith such comments; and

 



     

 

 



 

(h) as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify Allergan of any other matter
of which it becomes aware which would reasonably be expected to materially
delay or prevent filing of the Proxy Statement or the Scheme Document with the
SEC and the Panel, as applicable, or implementation of the Scheme, as the case
may be.

 



 

 **Section 3.3** **_Mutual Responsibilities of the Parties_**.

 



 

(a) If any of the Parties becomes aware of any information that, pursuant to
the Takeover Rules, the Act, the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, should be

Scheme Document or the Proxy Statement, as applicable, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Allergan further
agrees to cause the Scheme Document or the Proxy Statement, as applicable, as
so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the Panel and the SEC

(a) Each of the Parties will (i) give the other reasonable prior notice of any
proposed meeting or material substantive discussion or correspondence between
it or its Representatives with the Panel, or any amendment to be proposed to
the Scheme in connection therewith, and, except to the extent any such
correspondence relates to an Allergan Alternative Proposal or the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Article 9_,
afford the other reasonable opportunities to review and make comments and

provided always that any correspondence or other information required to be
provided under this _Section 3.4_ may be redacted:

 



 

(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of
Allergan;

 



 

(ii) to prevent the exchange of confidential information as required by
applicable Law ( _provided_ that the redacting Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would
not result in such confidentiality concerns); and

 



 

(iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns ( _provided_ that
the redacting Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such privilege
concerns).

as practicable, provide its written consent to AbbVie and to the Panel in
respect of any application made by AbbVie to the Panel:

(ii) for a derogation from the requirement under the Takeover Rules to
disclose AbbVie Financing Information in the Scheme Document, any supplemental
document

 



     

 

 



 

or other document sent to Allergan Shareholders or the holders of the Allergan
Options or Allergan Share Awards pursuant to the Takeover Rules;

 



 

(iii) for a derogation from Rule 16.1 and/or 20.1 of the Takeover Rules to

Financing and syndication arrangements with respect to its Financing, and to
provide information to lenders and prospective lenders on such terms as the
Panel may permit; and

 



 

(iv) for a derogation from the disclosure requirements of Rule 24.3 of the
Takeover Rules, seeking consent to the aggregation of dealings for purposes of
disclosure in the Scheme Document and seeking consent to the aggregation on a
bi-weekly basis of changes in information announced pursuant to Rule 2.10 of
the Takeover Rules.

 



 

(c) AbbVie undertakes, if so requested by Allergan to, as promptly as
practicable, provide its written consent to Allergan and to the Panel in
respect of any application made by Allergan to the Panel to permit entering
into and effecting the retention, bonus and/or benefit arrangements
contemplated by Section 5.1(b)(xii) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(d) AbbVie and Allergan undertake, if so requested by the other Party to, as

(unless the Panel decision is successfully appealed by either Allergan or
AbbVie).

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit the Parties obligations
under the Takeover Rules.

 



 

 **Section 3.5** **_No Scheme Amendment by Allergan_**. Except as required by
applicable Law, the High Court and/or the Panel, Allergan shall not take any
of the following actions after despatch of the Scheme Document, in each case,
without the prior written consent of AbbVie:

 



 

(a) amend the Scheme;

 



 

(b) adjourn or postpone (or propose an adjournment or postponement of) the
Court Meeting or the EGM; _provided_ , _however_ , that Allergan may, without
the consent of, but after consultation with, AbbVie, adjourn or postpone (or
propose to adjourn or postpone) the Court Meeting or EGM if (i) in the case of
adjournment, such adjournment was requested by the Allergan Shareholders (but
only to the extent the proposal for such adjournment was not proposed by
Allergan or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives), (ii)
reasonably necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Scheme Document or Proxy Statement is provided to the Allergan
Shareholders or to permit dissemination of information which is material to
the Allergan Shareholders voting at the Court Meeting or the EGM (but only for
so long as the Allergan Board determines in good faith, after having consulted
with outside counsel, as is reasonably necessary or advisable to give the
Allergan

 



     

 

 



 

Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such disclosure or information),
or (iii) as of the time the Court Meeting or EGM is scheduled (as set forth in
the Scheme Document or Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Allergan
Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) (A) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Court Meeting or the EGM (but only
until a meeting can be held at which there are a sufficient number of Allergan
Shares represented to constitute a quorum) or (B) voting for the approval of
the Court Resolutions or the EGM Resolutions, as applicable (but only until a
meeting can be held at which there are a sufficient number of votes of
Allergan Shareholders to approve the Court Meeting Resolutions or the EGM
Resolutions, as applicable); _provided_ , _further_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, other than any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law, including adjournments or postponements to the extent
reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided or made available to Allergan
Shareholders or to permit dissemination of information which is material to
shareholders voting at the Court Meeting and EGM and to give the Allergan
Shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any such supplement or amendment or
other information, no such adjournment or postponement pursuant to clause (i)
or (iii) shall, without the prior written consent of AbbVie (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), be for a period
exceeding 15 Business Days and Allergan may not adjourn or postpone the Court
Meeting or the EGM pursuant to clause (i) or (iii) more than three times; or

 



 

(c) amend the Resolutions (in each case, in the form set out in the Scheme
Document) after despatch of the Scheme Document without the consent of AbbVie
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

 **Section 3.6** **_Switching to a Takeover Offer_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Section 3.6_, in the event that AbbVie
reasonably determines that a competitive situation (as that term is defined in
the Takeover Rules) exists or, based on facts known at the time, may
reasonably be expected to arise in connection with the Acquisition, AbbVie may
elect (subject to receiving the Panels consent, if required) to implement the
Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer (rather than the Scheme), whether or
not the Scheme Document has been posted.

 



 

(b) If AbbVie elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover
Offer, Allergan undertakes to provide AbbVie and its Representatives as
promptly as reasonably practicable with all such information about the
Allergan Group (including directors and their connected persons) as may
reasonably be required for inclusion in the Takeover Offer Document (and any
prospectus in connection with the Share Consideration) and to provide all such
other assistance as may reasonably be required by the Takeover Rules in
connection with the preparation of the Takeover Offer Document, including
reasonable access to, and ensuring the provision of reasonable assistance by,
its management and Representatives.

 



 

(c) If AbbVie elects to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer,
Allergan agrees:

 



 

(i) that the Takeover Offer Document will contain provisions consistent with
the terms and conditions set out in the Rule 2.5 Announcement, the relevant

 



     

 

 



 

Conditions and such other further terms and conditions as agreed (including
any modification thereto) between AbbVie and the Panel; _provided_ , _however_
, that the terms and conditions of the Takeover Offer shall be at least as
favorable to the Allergan Shareholders and the holders of Allergan Options and
Allergan Share Awards as those which would apply in relation to the Scheme
(except for the 80% acceptance condition contemplated by paragraph 9 of
Appendix III to the Rule 2.5 Announcement);

 



 

(ii) to reasonably co-operate and consult with AbbVie in the preparation of
the Takeover Offer Document or any other document or filing (including any
necessary prospectus in respect of the Share Consideration) which is required
for the purposes of implementing the Acquisition; and

 



 

(iii) that, subject to the obligations of the Allergan Board under the
Takeover Rules, and unless the Allergan Board has made an Allergan Change of
Recommendation pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 5.3_, the Takeover
Offer shall incorporate a recommendation to the Allergan Shareholders from the
Allergan Board to accept the Takeover Offer and such recommendation shall not
subsequently be withdrawn, adversely modified or qualified except as
contemplated by _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(d) If AbbVie elects to implement the Acquisition by way of the Takeover Offer
in accordance with _Section 3.6(a)_, the Parties mutually agree:

 



 

(i) to prepare and file with, or submit to, the SEC, the Panel and the High
Court, all documents, amendments and supplements required to be filed
therewith or submitted thereto pursuant to the Takeover Rules, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, or otherwise by applicable Law in connection with the
Takeover Offer and to make any applications or initiate any appearances as may
be required by or desirable to the High Court for the purpose of
discontinuing, cancelling or terminating the High Court proceedings initiated
in connection with the Scheme and, unless the Allergan Board has made an
Allergan Change of Recommendation, each Party shall have reasonable
opportunities to review and make comments on all such documents, amendments
and supplements and, following good faith consideration of such comments by
the other Party and approval of such documents, amendments and supplements by
the other Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, file or submit, as the case may be, such documents,
amendments and supplements with or to the SEC, the Panel and the High Court
(as applicable);

 



 

(ii) to provide the other Party with any comments received from the SEC, the
Panel or the High Court on any documents filed by it with the SEC, the Panel
or the High Court promptly after receipt thereof, other than with respect to
any such documents to the extent related to an Allergan Alternative Proposal;
and

 



 

(iii) to provide the other Party with reasonable prior notice of any proposed
material oral communication with the SEC, the Panel or the High Court and,
except to the extent prohibited by the SEC, the Panel or the High Court,
afford the other Party reasonable opportunity to participate therein, other
than with respect to any such communication to the extent related to an
Allergan Alternative Proposal.

 



      

 

 



 

(e) If the Takeover Offer is consummated, AbbVie shall cause Acquirer Sub (or
their respective designees) to effect as promptly as reasonably practicable,
following it becoming entitled under the Act to do so, a compulsory
acquisition of any Allergan Shares under section 457 of the Act not acquired
in the Takeover Offer for the same consideration per share as provided for in
the Takeover Offer.

 



 

(f) For clarity and except as may be required by the Takeover Rules (and
without limiting any other provision of this Agreement), nothing in this
_Section 3.6_ shall require Allergan to provide AbbVie with any information
with respect to, or to otherwise take or fail to take any action in connection
with Allergans consideration of or response to, any actual or potential
Allergan Alternative Proposal.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4** ** 
EQUITY AWARDS**

 



 

 **Section 4.1** **_Allergan Options_**. As of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Allergan Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
substituted with an option, granted under the AbbVie Share Plan (an "
**Allergan Replacement Option** "), to acquire (a) that number of whole AbbVie
Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (i) the number of Allergan Shares subject to such Allergan
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Equity Award
Conversion Ratio, (b) at an exercise price per AbbVie Share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
exercise price per Allergan Share of such Allergan Option by (ii) the Equity
Award Conversion Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 4.1_,
each such Allergan Replacement Option granted under the AbbVie Share Plan
pursuant to this _Section 4.1_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same terms and conditions that applied to the corresponding Allergan
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
for such other immaterial administrative or ministerial changes as in the
reasonable and good faith determination of AbbVie are appropriate to
effectuate the administration of the Allergan Replacement Options and are not
adverse (other than in any _de minimis_ respect) to any holders of Allergan
Options.

 



 

 **Section 4.2** **_Allergan Share Awards_**.

 



 

(a) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence
of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each Allergan Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be substituted with
an award, granted under the AbbVie Share Plan (an " **Allergan Replacement
Share Award** "), with respect to a number of whole AbbVie Shares (rounded up
to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the applicable number of Allergan Shares subject to such Allergan Share Award
(including any corresponding dividend equivalent units) immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Ratio. Each Allergan
PSU Award shall be converted into an AbbVie restricted stock unit award, and
for any Allergan PSU Award with a performance period that remains subject to
performance vesting

 



     

 

 



 

conditions as of the date hereof (i.e., any Allergan PSU Award for which the
level of performance vesting has not yet been determined), the number of
Allergan Shares underlying such Allergan PSU Award shall be equal to 130% of
the target number of Allergan Shares subject to such Allergan PSU Award.
Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 4.2(a)_, each Allergan
Replacement Share Award granted under the AbbVie Share Plan pursuant to this
_Section 4.2(a)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same
terms and conditions (including, for any Allergan PSU Award, the time vesting
conditions provided in the applicable award agreement, but excluding any
performance-based vesting conditions) that applied to the corresponding
Allergan Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for terms
rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or for such other immaterial administrative or ministerial changes
as in the reasonable and good faith determination of AbbVie are appropriate to
effectuate the administration of the Allergan Replacement Share Awards and are
not adverse (other than in any _de minimis_ respect) to any holders of
Allergan Share Awards.

 



 

(b) The actions contemplated by this _Section 4.2_ shall be taken in
accordance with Section 409A and, if applicable, Section 422 of the Code.

 



 

 **Section 4.3** **_Other Actions in Connection With Substitution of Allergan
Options and Allergan Share Awards_**.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, AbbVie shall deliver to
the holders of Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share
Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights, and the
applicable award agreements evidencing the grants of such Allergan Replacement
Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards. The Allergan Replacement
Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards will be settled in AbbVie
Shares, and AbbVie shall take all corporate action necessary to effectuate the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for purposes of clarity, it is
understood by AbbVie, Allergan and Acquirer Sub that the Allergan Replacement
Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards shall be awarded and issued
under the AbbVie Share Plan. For clarity, the terms and conditions applicable
to such Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards
shall be no less favorable than the terms and conditions (other than, in the
case of the Allergan PSU Awards, as provided above, performance-based vesting
conditions) set forth in the Allergan Share Plans and the award agreements
pursuant to which the replaced Allergan Options and Allergan Share Awards were
originally granted, notwithstanding that the Allergan Replacement Options and
Allergan Replacement Share Awards will be issued under the AbbVie Share Plan
and corresponding award agreements issued thereunder. For clarity, the
Allergan Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards shall
comply with the requirements of "Qualified Replacement Awards" with respect to
any Allergan Share Awards granted under the Allergan 2013 Plan.

 



 

(b) AbbVie shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of AbbVie Shares for delivery with respect to Allergan
Replacement Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards substituted by it in
accordance with _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2(a)_ and this _Section 4.3_. To
the extent necessary, AbbVie shall, no later than the tenth day following the
Effective Date, file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) with respect to the AbbVie Shares subject to such
Allergan Replacement

 



     

 

 



 

Options and Allergan Replacement Share Awards pursuant to _Section 4.1_,
_Section 4.2(a)_ and this _Section 4.3_.

 



 

 **Section 4.4** **_Reasonable Best Efforts_**. Each of the Parties shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Article 4_, including
having the applicable board or committee administering the plans governing the
affected awards, adopt resolutions necessary to effect the foregoing.

 



 

 **Section 4.5** **_Amendment of Articles_**. Allergan shall procure that a
special resolution be proposed to the Allergan Shareholders at the EGM
proposing that the Allergan Memorandum and Articles of Association be amended
so that any Allergan Shares allotted following the EGM will either be subject
to the terms of the Scheme or acquired by AbbVie for the same consideration
per Allergan Share as shall be payable to Allergan Shareholders under the
Scheme (depending upon the timing of such allotment); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in such amendment to the Allergan Memorandum and Articles of
Association shall prohibit the sale (whether on a stock exchange or otherwise)
of any Allergan Shares issued on the exercise of Allergan Options or vesting
or settlement of Allergan Share Awards, as applicable, following the EGM but
prior to the sanction of the Scheme by the High Court, it being always
acknowledged that each and every Allergan Share will be bound by the terms of
the Scheme.

 **Section 5.3** **_Non-Solicitation_**.

required to take so as to comply with the requirements of the Takeover Rules,
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of Effective Time and the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
_Article 9_, except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 5.3_, Allergan
shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers and employees not to, and it shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing information to any Person in
connection with) the submission of any Allergan Alternative Proposal or any
indication, proposal or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Allergan Alternative Proposal;

 



 

(ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with,

Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with,
or knowingly assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly

seek to make, or has made, an Allergan Alternative Proposal (except to notify
such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_);

 



 

(iii) (A) withdraw or qualify, amend or modify in any manner adverse to

the foregoing in this clause (iii), an " **Allergan Change of Recommendation**
");

 



 

(iv) take any action to make any "moratorium", "control share acquisition",

Allergan Alternative Proposal; or

 



 

(v) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other agreement
providing for or relating to an Allergan Alternative Proposal (other than an
Allergan Alternative Proposal NDA).

 



 

Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Allergan Board from (x) complying
with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard to an Allergan
Alternative Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement made to so
comply is consistent with this _Section 5.3(a)_ or (y) making any required
disclosure to the Allergan Shareholders if the Allergan

 



     

 

 



 

Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ that any Allergan Change of
Recommendation involving or relating to an Allergan Alternative Proposal may
only be made in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.3(b)_, _Section
5.3(c)_, _Section 5.3(d)_ and _Section 5.3(e)_. For clarity, a "stop, look
and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not constitute an Allergan Change
of Recommendation.

 



 

Additionally, Allergan shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective directors, officers and employees to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries other
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Allergan
Alternative Proposal or with respect to any indication, proposal or inquiry
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Allergan Alternative Proposal.
Allergan will promptly (and in each case within 72 hours from the date of this
Agreement) request from each Person (and such Persons Representatives) that
has executed a confidentiality agreement during the last eighteen months in
connection with its consideration of making an Allergan Alternative Proposal
to return or destroy (as provided in the terms of such confidentiality
agreement) all confidential information concerning Allergan or any of its
Subsidiaries and shall promptly (and in each case within 72 hours from the
date of this Agreement) terminate all physical and electronic data access
previously granted to each such Person.

 



 

(b) _Responding to Allergan Alternative Proposals_. Notwithstanding _Section
5.3(a)_, if at any time prior to the receipt of the Allergan Shareholder
Approval (the " **Allergan Approval Time** ") (and in no event after the
Allergan Approval Time), the Allergan Board receives a written Allergan
Alternative Proposal made after the date hereof which has not resulted from a
breach in any material respect of this _Section 5.3_, the Allergan Board,
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) contact the Third
Party that has made such Allergan Alternative Proposal in order to ascertain
facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Allergan Board informing
itself about such Allergan Alternative Proposal and such Third Party, and (ii)
(x) engage in negotiations or discussions with any such Third Party that has
made such an unsolicited written Allergan Alternative Proposal, (y) furnish to
such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources nonpublic
information relating to Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to
Allergan than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of
which shall be provided, promptly after its execution, to AbbVie for
informational purposes (such confidentiality agreement, the " **Allergan
Alternative Proposal NDA** "); _provided_ that all such non-public information
(to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to AbbVie) is provided or made available to AbbVie, as the case may
be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that prior to and as a condition
of taking any actions described in this clause (ii), the Allergan Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such Allergan
Alternative Proposal either constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Allergan Superior Proposal.

 



      

 

 



 

(c) _Notice_. Allergan shall notify AbbVie promptly (but in any event within
48 hours) if any Allergan Alternative Proposal or any indication, proposal or
inquiry by a Third Party that would reasonably be expected to make an Allergan
Alternative Proposal, is received by Allergan. Each such notice shall be
provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and, to the
extent applicable, the material terms and conditions (including price) of, any
such Allergan Alternative Proposal, indication, proposal or inquiry. Following
such initial notice, Allergan shall keep AbbVie reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and details of
any such Allergan Alternative Proposal, indication, proposal or inquiry and
shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to
AbbVie copies of all material correspondence and written materials sent or
provided by or to Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of its or their
respective Representatives) that describes any terms or conditions of any
Allergan Alternative Proposal. Neither Allergan nor any of its Subsidiaries
will enter into any agreement with any Person which prohibits Allergan from
providing any information to AbbVie in accordance with, or otherwise complying
with, this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(d) _Fiduciary Exception to Allergan Change of Recommendation Provision_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
_Section 5.3(e)_, prior to the Allergan Approval Time (and in no event after
the Allergan Approval Time), the Allergan Board may (A) make an Allergan
Change of Recommendation, or (B) terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 9.1(a)(ii)(B)_ in order to substantially concurrently enter into a
definitive agreement providing for an Allergan Superior Proposal if (x) in the
case of such an action taken in connection with an Allergan Alternative
Proposal, the Allergan Alternative Proposal has not been withdrawn and the
Allergan Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such
Allergan Alternative Proposal constitutes an Allergan Superior Proposal, or
(y) in the case of an Allergan Change of Recommendation contemplated by clause
(A) above involving or relating to an Allergan Intervening Event (and not
involving any Allergan Alternative Proposal), the Allergan Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Last Look_. The Allergan Board and Allergan, as applicable, shall not
take any of the actions contemplated by _Section 5.3(d)_ unless prior to
taking such action (i) Allergan has notified AbbVie, in writing at least three
Business Days before taking such action, that Allergan intends to take such
action, which notice attaches, in the case of an Allergan Change of
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)(A)_ in response to an Allergan
Superior Proposal or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
5.3(d)(B)_ and _Section 9.1(a)(ii)(B)_, the most current version of each
proposed Contract providing for or related to such Allergan Superior Proposal
(including any Contract relating to financing or expense reimbursement) and
the identity of the Third Party(ies) making the Allergan Superior Proposal or,
in the case of an Allergan Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed
description of the facts relating to such Allergan Intervening Event, (ii) if
requested by AbbVie, during such three Business Day period, Allergan and its
Representatives shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith with AbbVie
(to the extent that AbbVie desires to so discuss or negotiate) regarding any
proposal by AbbVie to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such
Allergan Superior Proposal or other

 



     

 

 



 

potential Allergan Change of Recommendation and (iii) after such three
Business Day period, the Allergan Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel and taking into account any proposal by AbbVie to amend
the terms of this Agreement, that in the case of any such action in connection
with an Allergan Alternative Proposal, such Allergan Alternative Proposal
continues to constitute an Allergan Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that in the event of any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of any such Allergan Superior Proposal, a new written
notification from Allergan consistent with that described in clause (i) of
this _Section 5.3(e)_ shall be required, and a new notice period under clause
(i) of this _Section 5.3(e)_ shall commence, during which notice period
Allergan shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section
5.3(e)_ anew, except that such new notice period shall be for two Business
Days (as opposed to three Business Days)). After delivery of such written
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_, Allergan shall promptly inform
AbbVie of all material developments affecting the material terms of any such
Allergan Superior Proposal and shall promptly provide AbbVie with copies of
any additional written materials received or sent that are material to such
Allergan Superior Proposal.

Documents** "). No Subsidiary of Allergan is required to file any report,
schedule, form, statement, prospectus, registration statement or other
document with the SEC.

 



 

(ii) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseding
filing), the Allergan SEC Documents filed or furnished prior to the date of
this Agreement complied, and each Allergan SEC Document filed or furnished

requirements of NYSE, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the " **Sarbanes-Oxley Act** "), as the case may be.

 



 

(iii) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to

fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(v) Allergan and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act).

information relating to Allergan, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is
made known to Allergans principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, including during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared. Except as have not been and would not reasonably be expected
to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Allergan Group, taken
as a whole, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting Allergans principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in Allergans periodic
and current reports required under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this
Agreement, " **principal executive officer** " and " **principal financial
officer** " shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

 



 

(vi) Allergan and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under
the Exchange Act) (" **internal controls** ") designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of Allergans financial reporting and the
preparation of Allergans financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Allergans principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of
such internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to Allergans
auditors and the audit committee of the Allergan Board (A) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Allergans ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls.

 



 

(vii) Since January 1, 2017, each of the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of Allergan (or each former principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of Allergan, as applicable) has made

and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and

indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial position of
Allergan and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to

Governmental Entity.

 



 

(g) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or obligations of
Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,

required by GAAP to be reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of Allergan
and its Subsidiaries, other than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed and
provided for in Allergans consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto)
as of March 31, 2019 (the " **Allergan Balance Sheet** "), (ii) liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the date of the Allergan Balance Sheet, (iii) liabilities
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv)

any Allergan Permit, except where such revocation, cancellation, termination,

principal executive officer and principal financial officer have disclosed,
based on their most recent evaluation of such internal controls prior to the
date of this Agreement, to AbbVies auditors and the audit committee of the
AbbVie Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect AbbVies ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal

Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal and

_Section 7.2_, neither Allergan nor any of its respective Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access to, disclose information to or assist or
cooperate with AbbVie, in each case if and to the extent such access,

any representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any
obligation of any Party hereunder or (ii) update any section of Allergan
Disclosure Schedule or AbbVie Disclosure Schedule. A failure of either Party
to provide information pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ shall not constitute
a breach for purposes of any Condition.

consummate the Acquisition as promptly as reasonably practicable as otherwise
set forth in this _Section 7.2_) enter into a timing agreement with any
Governmental Entity in relation to any Antitrust Law, in connection with the
Acquisition or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ ,
that, without the prior written consent of Allergan, no pull and refile shall
occur after October 31, 2019. Without limiting AbbVies rights with respect to
overall strategy and control as set forth in the remainder of this Section
7.2(d), with respect to Specified Products the Parties agree to and shall

or (B) any Governmental Entity investigation, review or approval process.

 



 

(f) Subject to Section 7.2(d), applicable Laws relating to the sharing of

all other agreements entered into by the Parties, and subject to the proviso

Governmental Entity, allows the other party to participate.

 



 

(g) In the event that the latest date on which the High Court and/or the Panel
would permit Completion to occur is prior to the End Date, the Parties shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain consent of the High
Court and/or the Panel, as applicable, to an extension of such latest date
(but not beyond the End Date). If (i) the High Court and/or the Panel require
the lapsing of the Scheme prior to the End Date, or (ii) Condition 1 fails to
be satisfied, the Parties shall (unless and until this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Article 9) take all reasonable
actions required in order to re-initiate the Scheme process as promptly as
reasonably practicable (it being understood that no such lapsing described in
subclause (i) or (ii) shall, in and of itself, result in a termination of, or
otherwise affect any rights or obligations of any Party under, this
Agreement).

 



 

 **Section 7.3** **_Directors  and Officers Indemnification and
Insurance_**.

 



 

(a) For a period of not less than six years from the Effective Date, AbbVie
shall cause Allergan or any applicable Subsidiary thereof (collectively, the "
**D andO Indemnifying Parties**"), to the fullest extent each such DandO
Indemnifying Party is so authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or
hereafter in effect, to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at
the date hereof, was previously, or during the period from the date hereof
through the date of the Effective Time, serving as a director or officer of
Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries, or at the request or for the benefit of
Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, trustee or officer of any
other entity or any benefit plan maintained by Allergan or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " **D andO Indemnified Parties**"), as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement, in connection with any DandO Claim and any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) relating to or resulting from such DandO Claim; and (ii) promptly
advance to such DandO Indemnified Party any Claim Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
with respect to any DandO Claim in advance of the final disposition of such DandO
Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the DandO Indemnified
Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such DandO Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security, but subject to the DandO Indemnifying Partys receipt of a written
undertaking by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such Claim
Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Law that such DandO
Indemnified Party

 



     

 

 



 

is not entitled to be indemnified. All rights to indemnification and
advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased
to be a director or officer of Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries after the
date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such Persons heirs, successors,
executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section
7.3_: (x) the term " **D andO Claim**" means any threatened, asserted, pending
or completed Action, whether instituted by any Governmental Entity or any
other Person, arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time that relate to such DandO Indemnified Partys
duties or service (A) as a director or officer of Allergan or the applicable
Subsidiary thereof at or prior to the Effective Time (including with respect
to any acts, facts, events or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement, the Scheme, the Acquisition and the consummation
of the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Acquisition),
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith) or (B) as a director, trustee or officer of any other
entity or any benefit plan maintained by Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries
(for which such DandO Indemnified Party is or was serving at the request or for
the benefit of Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries) at or prior to the
Effective Time; and (y) the term " **Claim Expenses** " means reasonable out-
of-pocket attorneys fees and all other reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court
costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in any DandO Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this _Section 7.3(a),_ including any action relating to a claim
for indemnification or advancement brought by a DandO Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) For a period of not less than six years from the Effective Date, AbbVie
shall cause the organizational documents of Allergan to contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the
Organizational Documents of Allergan as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of at least six years from the Effective Date in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party, unless
any modification or amendment is required by applicable Law (but then only to
the extent required by applicable Law). At Allergans option and expense,
prior to the Effective Time, Allergan may purchase (and pay in full the
aggregate premium for) a six-year prepaid "tail" insurance policy (which
policy by its express terms shall survive the Acquisition) of at least the
same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less
favorable to the directors and officers of Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries
as Allergans and its Subsidiaries existing directors and officers
insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six years from the
Effective Time for DandO Claims arising from facts, acts, events or omissions
that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the premium
for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual amount currently paid by Allergan and its Subsidiaries for such
insurance (such amount being the " **Maximum Premium** "). If Allergan fails
to obtain such tail policy prior to the Effective Time, AbbVie shall obtain
such a tail policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such tail
policy shall not be required to exceed the Maximum Premium; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if such tail policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained
only by paying a premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, AbbVie shall only
be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying a premium
equal to the Maximum Premium. AbbVie and Allergan shall

 



     

 

 



 

cause any such policy (whether obtained by AbbVie or Allergan) to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and AbbVie shall,
following the Effective Time, cause Allergan to honor all its obligations
thereunder.

 



 

(c) If AbbVie or Allergan or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company, partnership or other Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of AbbVie or Allergan, as applicable, assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.3_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.3_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party (who are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.3_), his or her
heirs and his or her personal Representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of AbbVie, and following the Effective Time, Allergan.
The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section 7.3_ shall
not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which a DandO Indemnified
Party is entitled, pursuant to applicable Law or Contract made available to
AbbVie prior to the date hereof.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** **_Employment and Benefit Matters_**.

 



 

(a) From the date of Completion through the earlier of (i) the second
anniversary of the Effective Time, and (ii) December 31, 2021 (or, if shorter,
the period of employment of the relevant Allergan Employee) (the " **Benefits
Continuation Period** "), Acquirer Sub shall provide, and AbbVie shall cause
Acquirer Sub to provide, to (i) each Allergan Employee a base salary that is
no less favorable than the base salary provided to such Allergan Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) each Allergan Employee a target
annual cash bonus opportunity that is no less favorable than the target annual
cash bonus opportunity provided to such Allergan Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (iii) an Allergan Employee who is eligible to be selected
to receive an annual equity compensation opportunity (inclusive of dividend
equivalent rights) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, pursuant to
the ordinary course practices of Allerganas in effect of, and disclosed to
AbbVie prior to, the date hereof, shall continue to be eligible to be selected
to receive an annual equity compensation opportunity, with a target grant date
value that is no less favorable than the target grant date value of the annual
equity compensation opportunity (inclusive of dividend equivalent rights)
applicable to his or her global grade level, as reflected in the "2019 Long-
Term Incentive Targets" schedule provided to AbbVie prior to the date hereof),
and AbbVie shall make such grants at the same rate of participation per global
grade level as disclosed to AbbVie prior to the date hereof and with the form
of the equity compensation opportunity to be determined in AbbVies sole
discretion, and (iv) to the Allergan Employees as a group, employee benefits
that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the employee benefits
provided to the Allergan Employees under the Allergan Benefit Plans as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that for purposes
of determining whether such employee benefits are no less favorable in the
aggregate, any defined benefit pension plan benefits, nonqualified deferred
compensation, subsidized retiree health or welfare benefits, post-

 



     

 

 



 

termination health or welfare benefits, and retention or change in control
payments or awards shall not be taken into account.

 



 

(b) In addition, Acquirer Sub shall provide, and AbbVie shall cause Acquirer
Sub to provide, to each Allergan Employee who experiences a termination of
employment during the Benefits Continuation Period, severance benefits that
are no less favorable than the severance benefits to which such Allergan
Employee would have been entitled upon such a termination of employment under
any Allergan Benefit Plan that is a severance plan, policy, program, agreement
or arrangement and set forth on Section 7.4(b) of the Allergan Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the " **Severance Arrangements** ") and in which such
Allergan Employee was eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, but only to the extent such Severance Arrangements are set
forth on Section 7.4(b) of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule and were furnished
to the Buyer prior to the date hereof. For purposes of determining compliance
with this Section 7.4(b), only the existing terms of the Severance
Arrangements will be taken into account, and any modifications to the
Severance Arrangements that are effective after the date hereof but prior to
the Effective Time (and are made without AbbVies advance written consent)
will be disregarded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, for each Allergan Employee who is eligible to participate in the
Severance Arrangements marked with an asterisk (*) on Section 7.4(b) of the
Allergan Disclosure Schedule as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the protected period under this Section 7.4(b) shall apply to a termination of
employment that occurs during the two-year period immediately following the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and determining level
of benefits under the employee benefit plans of AbbVie providing benefits to
any Allergan Employees (the " **New Plans** "), each Allergan Employee shall
be credited with his or her years of service with the Allergan Group and its
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent and for the same
purpose as such Allergan Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under the corresponding Allergan Benefit Plan in which
such Allergan Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to (A) any defined benefit pension plan or any retiree or post-
termination health or welfare benefits, (B) any benefit plan that is frozen or
for which participation is limited to a grandfathered population, (C) any
cash- or equity-based compensation arrangements, or (E) to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation with
respect to the same period of service, and _provided further_ that such
service shall only be credited to the extent service with AbbVie is credited
for similarly situated employees of the AbbVie Group under the New Plans. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each
Allergan Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is replacing comparable coverage under an Allergan Benefit Plan in which
such Allergan Employee had already satisfied any such waiting period and
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " **Old Plans** "), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Allergan
Employee, AbbVie shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause (1) all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in the New Plans,
was subject to such conditions under the comparable Old Plans, and (2) any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her

 



     

 

 



 

covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(d) AbbVie hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of any Allergan Benefit Plan will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

 



 

(e) AbbVie and Allergan shall cooperate in respect of consultation obligations
and similar notice and bargaining obligations owed to any employees or
consultants of Allergan or any Subsidiary of Allergan, or any of their
respective bargaining representatives, in accordance with all applicable Laws
and works council or other bargaining agreements, if any. Allergan shall
satisfy all such obligations prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) AbbVie and Allergan agree to the additional matters set forth in _Section
7.4(f)_ of the Allergan Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ (whether express or implied)
shall (i) create or confer any rights, remedies or claims upon any employee of
Allergan or any of its Affiliates or any right of employment or engagement or
continued employment or engagement or any particular term or condition of
employment or engagement for any Allergan Employee or any other Person, (ii)
be considered or deemed to establish, amend, or modify any Allergan Benefit
Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement,
arrangement, or Contract, (iii) prohibit or limit the ability of AbbVie or any
of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation
plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement, or contract at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or (iv) confer
any rights or benefits (including any third-party beneficiary rights) on any
Person other than the Parties.

other Party in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to
be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing of
Allergan Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of Allergan Shares and
other securities of Allergan under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time; _provided_ that such delisting and deregistration
shall not be effective until after the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** **_AbbVie Board of Directors_**. AbbVie shall take all
necessary action to cause, effective at the Effective Time, (a) the number of
members of the AbbVie Board to be increased by two and (b) the vacancies
created by the foregoing clause (a) to be filled by two

immediately prior to the Effective Time, and who are independent with respect
to AbbVie.

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Completion and the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
_Article 9_, in a timely manner so as not to delay the Completion, the AbbVie

of any of such definitive agreements, or (D) any material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to such definitive agreements with
respect to the obligations to fund the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded under such definitive agreements at the Completion;
_provided_ that in no event will the AbbVie Parties be under any obligation to
disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege ( _provided_ that the AbbVie Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause any such information to be disclosed in a
manner that would not result in the loss of any such privilege).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
AbbVie Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that their obligations under

information or projections, (B) none of the Allergan Board, officers of
Allergan, or directors and officers of the Subsidiaries of Allergan shall be
required to adopt resolutions or consents approving the agreements, documents
or instruments pursuant to which the Financing is obtained or any Allergan
Note Offers and Consent Solicitations is consummated (except the execution and
delivery of any applicable Allergan Supplemental Indentures), and (C) neither
Allergan nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the
taking of any action that would (i) interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of Allergan or its Subsidiaries, (ii) cause any representation
or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by Allergan or any of its
Subsidiaries (unless waived by AbbVie), (iii) cause any director, officer or
employee or shareholder of Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any

confidential information provided by or on behalf of Allergan or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ to be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
that Allergan acknowledges and agrees that the confidentiality undertakings
that will be obtained in connection with syndication of the Financing will be
in a form customary for use in the syndication of acquisition-related debt
during a takeover offer period in compliance with the requirements of the
Panel and the Takeover Rules.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation as to Certain Indebtedness_. AbbVie or one or more of its
Subsidiaries may (i) commence any of the following: (A) one or more offers to
purchase any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the Indentures for
cash (the " **Offers to Purchase** "); or (B) one or more offers to exchange
any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the Indentures for securities
issued by AbbVie or any of its Affiliates (the " **Offers to Exchange** ");
and (ii) solicit the consent of the holders of debt issued under the
Indentures regarding certain proposed amendments to the applicable Indenture
(the " **Consent Solicitations** " and, together with the Offers to Purchase
and Offers to Exchange, if any, the " **Allergan Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations** "); _provided_ that the closing of any such transaction shall
not be consummated until the Completion and any such transaction shall be
funded using consideration provided by AbbVie. Any Allergan Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations shall be made on such terms and conditions (including
price to be paid and conditionality) as are proposed by AbbVie

 



     

 

 



 

and which are permitted by the terms of the applicable Indenture and
applicable Laws, including SEC rules and regulations. AbbVie shall consult
with Allergan regarding the material terms and conditions of any Allergan Note
Offers and Consent Solicitations, including the timing and commencement of any
Allergan Note Offers and Consent Solicitations and any tender deadlines.
AbbVie shall have provided Allergan with the necessary offer to purchase,
offer to exchange, consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal,
press release, if any, in connection therewith, and each other document
relevant to the transaction that will be distributed by AbbVie in the
applicable Allergan Note Offers and Consent Solicitations (collectively, the "
**Debt Offer Documents** ") a reasonable period of time in advance of
commencing the applicable Allergan Note Offers and Consent Solicitations to
allow Allergan and its counsel to review and comment on such Debt Offer
Documents, and AbbVie shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made or input provided by Allergan and its legal counsel. Subject
to the receipt of the requisite holder consents, in connection with any or all
of the Consent Solicitations, Allergan shall execute a supplemental indenture
to the applicable Indenture in accordance with the terms thereof amending the
terms and provisions of such Indenture as described in the applicable Debt
Offer Documents in a form as reasonably requested by AbbVie (each, an "
**Allergan Supplemental Indenture** "); _provided_ that the amendments
effected by such supplemental indenture shall not become operative until the
Completion. Subject to the second paragraph of _Section 7.9(a)_ above, until
the earlier of the Completion and the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with _Article 9_ Allergan shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its
reasonable best efforts, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts,
to provide all reasonable and customary cooperation as may be reasonably
requested by AbbVie in writing to assist AbbVie in connection with any
Allergan Note Offers and Consent Solicitations (including upon AbbVies
written request, using reasonable best efforts to cause Allergans independent
accountants to provide customary consents for use of their reports to the
extent required in connection with any Allergan Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations). The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent,
depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Allergan Note Offers
and Consent Solicitations will be selected and retained by AbbVie, and their
fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid directly by AbbVie. If, at any
time prior to the completion of the Allergan Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations, Allergan or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or AbbVie
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, discovers any information that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents,
so that the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, such party that
discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
notify the other Party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by
AbbVie describing such information shall be disseminated to the holders of the
applicable notes, debentures or other debt securities of Allergan or its
Subsidiaries outstanding under the applicable Indenture. The consummation of
any or all of the Allergan Note Offers and Consent Solicitations shall not be
a condition to Completion.

 



 

(c) AbbVie shall, promptly upon request by Allergan, reimburse Allergan for
all reasonable and documented third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by Allergan or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the cooperation, and shall

 



     

 

 



 

indemnify and hold harmless Allergan, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, expenses (including attorneys fees), interest, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them, in connection with this _Section 7.9_
(other than to the extent resulting from (x) information provided by Allergan
or its Subsidiaries in writing in accordance with the terms hereof to the
extent such information, as provided, is inaccurate or misleading or (y)
Allergans or its Subsidiaries or Representatives willful misconduct or
gross negligence, as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction), in each case whether or not the Completion is
consummated or this Agreement is terminated.

 



 

 **Section 7.10** **_Transaction Litigation_**. Subject to the last sentence
of this _Section 7.10_, each of Allergan and AbbVie shall promptly notify the
other of any stockholder Actions (including derivative claims) commenced
against it, its Subsidiaries and/or its or its Subsidiaries respective
directors or officers relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters relating thereto (collectively, "
**Transaction Litigation** ") and shall keep the other Party informed
regarding any Transaction Litigation. Other than with respect to any
Transaction Litigation where the Parties are adverse to each other, each of
Allergan and AbbVie shall reasonably cooperate with the other in the defense
or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and shall give the other Party
the opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense and settlement of
such Transaction Litigation and shall consider in good faith the other Partys
advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation, and Allergan shall give
AbbVie the opportunity to participate in (but not control), at AbbVies
expense, the defense and settlement of such Transaction Litigation. Prior to
the Effective Time, other than with respect to Transaction Litigation where
the Parties are adverse to each other, neither Allergan nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall settle or offer to settle any Transaction Litigation
without the prior written consent of AbbVie (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 7.10_, in the event of any conflict with any
other covenant or agreement contained in _Section 7.2_ that expressly
addresses the subject matter of this _Section 7.10_, _Section 7.2_ shall
govern and control.

 



 

 **Section 7.11** **_Dividends_**. Each of Allergan and AbbVie shall
coordinate with the other on the payment of dividends with respect to Allergan
Shares and AbbVie Shares, and the declaration and setting of record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, in respect of any calendar quarter so that
Allergan Shareholders do not receive dividends on both the Allergan Shares and
AbbVie Shares received in the Acquisition in respect of the same calendar
quarter or fail to receive a dividend on either Allergan Shares or AbbVie
Shares received in the Acquisition in respect of any calendar quarter.

 



 

 **Section 7.12** **_State Takeover Statutes_**. Each of AbbVie and Allergan
shall (a) take all action necessary so that no "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transaction" or
"business combination" statute or regulation or other similar state anti-
takeover Law, or any similar provision of the Organizational Documents of
Allergan or the Organizational Documents of AbbVie, as applicable, is or
becomes applicable to the Scheme, the Acquisition or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) if any such Law or provision is or
becomes applicable to the Scheme, the Acquisition or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, cooperate and grant such approvals and take such actions
as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as

 



     

 

 



 

promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on the Scheme, the Acquisition
or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **Section 7.13** **_Acquirer Sub_**. Until the Effective Time, AbbVie shall
at all times be the direct or indirect owner of all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of Acquirer Sub. AbbVie shall take all action necessary to
cause Acquirer Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Acquisition on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

 **Section 8.1** **_Completion_**.

 



 

(a) _Completion Date_. Completion shall take place at 9:00 a.m., New York City

(i) Allergan shall cause a meeting of the Allergan Board (or a duly authorized

acceptable to AbbVie.

 



 

(c) On or substantially concurrently with the Completion and subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme:

 



 

(i) in respect of each Allergan Share subject to the Scheme, AbbVie shall pay
or cause to be paid the Cash Consideration to the applicable Allergan
Shareholder (and/or their nominees);

 



 

(ii) AbbVie shall issue and deliver or cause to be delivered 0.8660 (as it may
be adjusted pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(v)_, the " **Exchange Ratio** ") of
an AbbVie Share (the " **Share Consideration** " and, together with the Cash
Consideration and any cash in lieu of Fractional Entitlements due to an
Allergan Shareholder, the " **Scheme Consideration** ") to the applicable
Allergan Shareholder (and/or their nominees), which Share Consideration shall
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of
Liens (other than any restrictions imposed by applicable Law) and pre-emptive
rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that no fractions of AbbVie Shares ("
**Fractional Entitlements** ") shall be issued by AbbVie to the Allergan
Shareholders under this _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, and all Fractional Entitlements
that would otherwise have been due to any Allergan Shareholders shall be
aggregated and sold in the market by the Exchange Agent with the net proceeds
of any such sale distributed pro rata to such Allergan Shareholders in
accordance with the Fractional Entitlements to which they would otherwise have
been entitled;

 



 

(iii) Allergan shall deliver to AbbVie:

 



 

(A) a certified copy of the resolutions referred to in _Section 8.1(b)(i)_;

 



 

(B) letters of resignation from the directors that are removed from Allergan
in accordance with _Section 8.1(b)(i)(B)_ (each such letter to contain an
acknowledgement that such resignation is without any claim or right of action

any of their officers or employees for breach of contract, compensation for
loss of office, redundancy or unfair dismissal or on any other grounds
whatsoever in respect of the removal); and

 



 

(C) share certificates in respect of the aggregate number of shares in the
capital of Allergan to be issued to AbbVie (and/or its nominee) in accordance
with the Scheme;

Scheme, each of which (in the case of such Court Order, minute and Certificate
of Registration) shall be provided by Allergan to AbbVie immediately following
Allergans receipt thereof; and

 



 

(v) if the Acquisition would otherwise result in the issuance of AbbVie Shares
in excess of 19.99% of the AbbVie Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Completion (as reasonably determined by AbbVie) (the " **Share Cap** "), the
Exchange Ratio shall be reduced by the smallest number (rounded to the nearest
0.0001) that causes the total number of AbbVie Shares issuable in the
Acquisition to not exceed the Share Cap (the " **Exchange Ratio Modification
Number** "), and the Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount in
cash equal to (x) the Exchange Ratio Modification Number multiplied by (y) the
VWAP of the AbbVie Shares.

 



 

(d) _Exchange of Allergan Shares_.

 



 

(i) _Exchange Agent_. At or immediately following the Completion, AbbVie shall

Effective Time, and in any event within five Business Days after the Effective
Time, AbbVie shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time

Allergan Shares represented by book-entry shares that is entitled to receive
the Scheme Consideration pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ a letter of
transmittal and instructions for use in receiving payment of the Scheme
Consideration. Each holder of record of such Allergan Shares shall be entitled
to receive promptly following the Effective Time: (a) the amount of cash
payable in respect of the Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_plus the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of any Fractional Entitlements that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and (b) that number of AbbVie Shares into
which such holders Allergan Shares were converted pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit of
holders of the Allergan Shares on the Scheme Consideration payable in respect
of the Allergan Shares.

 



 

(iii) _Termination of Allergan Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which has not been transferred to the holders of Allergan Shares within
twelve months of the Completion Date shall be delivered to AbbVie or its

delivery shall affect any legal right that an Allergan Shareholder may have to
receive the Scheme Consideration.

 



     

 

 



 

(iv) _No Liability_. None of AbbVie, Acquirer Sub, Allergan or the Exchange
Agent or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees
and agents shall be liable to any person in respect of any Scheme
Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the
Allergan Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(v) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, AbbVie,
Allergan, the Exchange Agent and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person who was a holder of an Allergan Share subject to the Scheme such
amounts as AbbVie, Allergan, the Exchange Agent or such Affiliate is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Tax Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(C) if the High Court shall decline or refuse to sanction the Scheme, unless

material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this

termination, a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of such
Allergan Superior Proposal is duly executed and delivered by all parties

by the earlier of (x) the End Date and (y) 30 days following written notice by

Change of Recommendation shall have occurred; and

 



 

(iv) by mutual written consent of Allergan and AbbVie.

_Section 9.1(a)_ shall not give rise to any liability of the Parties except
as provided in the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, in the proviso to
_Section 9.1(c)_ and in _Section 9.2_. _Section 7.9(c)_ and _Article 10_
(other than _Section 10.1_ and _10.12_ ) of this Agreement shall survive, and
continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding its termination.

 



 

(c) Subject to the proviso in this _Section 9.1(c)_, upon valid termination

Acquisition, other than the obligation of Allergan (if applicable) to pay the
AbbVie Reimbursement Payments pursuant to the Expenses Reimbursement
Agreement) and the obligation of AbbVie (if applicable) to pay Allergan the

Termination Payment if Allergans breach of this Agreement shall have been the
primary cause of such Specified Termination.

 



 

(b) " **Specified Termination** " means a valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to:

 



 

(i) _Section 9.1(a)(i)(B)_ if, on the date of such termination, each of the
Conditions has been satisfied (other than any of Conditions 3(ii), 3(iii),
3(iv), 3(v) or 3(vi)(d) (which failure to be satisfied, in the case of each of
Conditions 3(v) and 3(vi)(d), results pursuant to or in connection with an
Antitrust Law in any jurisdiction listed on _Section 7.2(b)_ of the

 



     

 

 



 

Allergan Disclosure Schedule), or any Condition that by its nature can only be
satisfied on the Sanction Date); or

 



 

(ii) _Section 9.1(a)(i)(D)_ pursuant to or in connection with an Antitrust
Law in any jurisdiction listed on _Section 7.2(b)_ of the Allergan Disclosure
Schedule.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the Acquisition and that the Reverse
Termination Payment is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that
will compensate Allergan in the circumstances in which such payment is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Acquisition, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In addition, if AbbVie
fails to pay in a timely manner the Reverse Termination Payment, then AbbVie
shall reimburse Allergan for its reasonable costs and expenses (including
disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in connection with any Action to
obtain such payment, together with interest on the Reverse Termination Payment
from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10** ** 
GENERAL**

 



 

 **Section 10.1** **_Announcements_**. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law or the applicable rules of any securities exchange or
Governmental Entity (including the Panel), the Parties shall consult with each
other as to the terms of, the timing of and the manner of publication of any
formal public announcement which either Party may make primarily regarding the
Acquisition, the Scheme or this Agreement. AbbVie and Allergan shall each give
the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any such public
announcement and shall not issue any such public announcement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable
rules of any securities exchange or Governmental Entity (including the Panel).
For clarity, the provisions of this _Section 10.1_ do not apply to any
announcement, document or publication in connection with an Allergan
Alternative Proposal, Allergan Superior Proposal or an Allergan Change of

that would effect an increase in the Scheme Consideration whether before or
after an Allergan Change of Recommendation.

or such other postal or email address or fax number as it may have notified to

10.2_.

 



 

(iii) All such notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed
received on the date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to
5:00 p.m. (addressees local time) on a Business Day. Otherwise, any such
notice, request or communication shall be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day.

 



 

 **Section 10.3** **_Assignment_**. Neither Party shall assign all or any
part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other Party; _provided_ that AbbVie may assign any or
all of its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more of its Subsidiaries and Acquirer Sub may assign its
rights and

 



     

 

 



 

obligations hereunder, in whole or from time to time in part, to any other
wholly owned Subsidiary of AbbVie ( _provided_ , that the prior consent in
writing has been obtained from the Panel in respect of each such assignment),
but no such assignment shall relieve AbbVie or Acquirer Sub, as applicable, of
its obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 10.4** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and
the same agreement, and each Party may enter into this Agreement by executing
a counterpart and delivering it to the other Party (by hand delivery,
facsimile process, e-mail or otherwise).

 



 

 **Section 10.5** **_Amendment_**. No amendment of this Agreement shall be
binding unless the same shall be evidenced in writing duly executed by each of
the Parties, except that, following approval by the Allergan Shareholders,
there shall be no amendment to the provisions hereof which by applicable Law
would require further approval by the Allergan Shareholders without such
further approval nor shall there be any amendment or change not permitted
under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this
_Section 10.5_, _Sections 10.13(c)_ and _10.13(d)_ , _Section 10.14_ and
_Section 10.15_ may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise
modified in any manner adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of such Financing Sources party to any definitive agreement
relating to the Financing (it being expressly agreed that the Financing
Sources in their capacities as such shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 10.5_ and shall be entitled to the protections of the provisions
contained in this _Section 10.5_ as if they were a party to this Agreement).

 



 

 **Section 10.6** **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement, the Rule 2.5
Announcement and any documents delivered by AbbVie and Allergan in connection
herewith (including the AbbVie Disclosure Schedule and the Allergan Disclosure
Schedule), constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between AbbVie and
Allergan with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.7** **_Inadequacy of Damages_**. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable harm would occur and that the Parties would not have
any adequate remedy at Law (i) for any breach of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or (ii) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly
agreed that, except where this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with _Section 9.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without
proof of actual damages, and each Party further agrees to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy. Subject to _Section 9.1(c)_, the Parties further agree that (x) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 10.7_, a Party shall not
in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a Party under this Agreement and (y) nothing contained in this
_Section 10.7_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section 10.7_ before exercising any termination right under
_Section 9.1_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the

 



     

 

 



 

commencement of any action pursuant to this _Section 10.7_ or anything
contained in this _Section 10.7_ restrict or limit any Partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Section 9.1_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

 



 

 **Section 10.8** **_Disclosure Schedule References and SEC Document
References_**.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that each section or subsection of the Allergan
Disclosure Schedule or the AbbVie Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, shall be
deemed to qualify the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement,
irrespective of whether or not any particular section or subsection of this
Agreement specifically refers to the Allergan Disclosure Schedule or the
AbbVie Disclosure Schedule, as applicable. The Parties further agree that
(other than with respect to any items disclosed in _Section 6.1(A)(k)_ of the
Allergan Disclosure Schedule or _Section 6.2(A)(h)_ of the AbbVie Disclosure
Schedule, for which an explicit reference in any other section shall be
required in order to apply to such other section) disclosure of any item,
matter or event in any particular section or subsection of either the Allergan
Disclosure Schedule or the AbbVie Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of the Allergan
Disclosure Schedule or the AbbVie Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, to which
the relevance of such disclosure would be reasonably apparent on its face,
notwithstanding the omission of a cross-reference to such other section or
subsections.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that in no event shall any disclosure contained in any
part of any Allergan SEC Document or AbbVie SEC Document entitled "Risk
Factors", "Forward-Looking Statements", "Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements", "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking
Statements" or "Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" or any other
disclosures in any Allergan SEC Document or AbbVie SEC Document that are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of or otherwise qualify) any
representations and warranties of any Party contained in this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.9** **_Remedies and Waivers_**. No delay or omission by either
Party in exercising any right, power or remedy provided by Law or under this
Agreement shall affect that right, power or remedy or operate as a waiver of
it. The exercise or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided by
Law or under this Agreement shall not preclude any other or further exercise
of it or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 



 

 **Section 10.10** **_Severability_**.

 



 

(a) If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this Agreement or the
Acquisition is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement or, as appropriate, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Acquisition, so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an equitable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible in accordance with applicable Law.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) If at any time any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal,
invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any jurisdiction,
that shall not affect or impair (i) the legality, validity or enforceability
in that jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement; or (ii) the
legality, validity or enforceability under the Law of any other jurisdiction
of that or any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.11** **_No Partnership and No Agency_**.

 



 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement and no action taken by the Parties pursuant to
this Agreement shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a partnership,
association, joint venture or other co-operative entity between any of the
Parties.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement and no action taken by the Parties pursuant to
this Agreement shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, either Party the
agent of the other Party for any purpose. No Party has, pursuant to this
Agreement, any authority or power to bind or to contract in the name of the
other Party to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.12** **_Costs and Expenses_**. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement (including _Section 7.9_ hereof) and the Expenses
Reimbursement Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such cost or expense,
except that (a) the Panels document review fees shall be borne by AbbVie, (b)
the costs associated with the filing, printing, publication and proposing of
the Rule 2.5 Announcement shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by AbbVie,
(c) the costs associated with the filing, printing, publication and proposing
of the Scheme Document, Proxy Statement and any other materials required to be
proposed to Allergan Shareholders pursuant SEC rules, the Act or the Takeover
Rules shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by Allergan, (d) the filing
fees incurred in connection with notifications with any Governmental Entities
under any Antitrust Laws, shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by AbbVie
and (e) the cost incurred in connection with soliciting proxies in connection
with the Court Meeting and the EGM shall be borne one hundred percent (100%)
by Allergan.

 



 

 **Section 10.13** **_Governing Law and Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all Actions based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquisition and the Scheme and matters
related thereto (including matters related to the Takeover Rules) shall, to
the extent required by the Laws of Ireland, and the interpretation of the
duties of directors of Allergan shall, be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of Ireland.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that the state and federal courts
sitting in the State of Delaware, and any appellate courts therefrom, are to
have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any Action based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, for
such purposes, irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts and waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which
any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Action in any
such court. Any Action based

 



     

 

 



 

upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall therefore be brought in the state and federal courts
sitting in the State of Delaware, and any appellate courts therefrom.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Scheme and matters related to the sanction
thereof shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court and any
appellate courts therefrom.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that any
Action (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising
out of, or in any way relating to, the Financing or the performance of
services thereunder or related thereto against or by any Financing Source in
its capacity as such shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New
York, and any appellate court therefrom, and each Party hereto submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) not to bring or permit any of its Affiliates
to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Action in any other
court, (iii) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of,
any such Action in any such court, (iv) that a final judgment in any such
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law and (v) that any such
Action shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of New York (it being expressly agreed that the Financing Sources in
their capacities as such shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
10.13(c)_ and shall be entitled to enforce the provisions contained in this
_Section 10.13(c)_ as if they were a party to this Agreement).

 



 

(d) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES THEREUNDER OR RELATED
THERETO (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM), INCLUDING IN ANY
ACTION AGAINST OR BY ANY FINANCING SOURCE IN ITS CAPACITY AS SUCH, INCLUDING
ANY ACTION DESCRIBED IN _SECTION 10.13(C)(I)_ IN ANY SUCH COURT DESCRIBED IN
_SECTION 10.13(C)(I)_ (IT BEING EXPRESSLY AGREED THAT THE FINANCING SOURCES
IN THEIR CAPACITIES AS SUCH SHALL BE THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS
_SECTION 10.13(D)_ AND SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED
IN THIS _SECTION 10.13(D)_ AS IF THEY WERE A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT).

 



 

 **Section 10.14** **_Third Party Beneficiaries_**.

 



 

Except:

 



 

(a) as provided in _Section 7.3_;

 



 

(b) as provided in _Section 7.9(c)_;

 



 

(c) as provided in _Section 10.5_;

 



     

 

 



 

(d) as provided in _Section 10.13(c)_;

(f) as provided in this _Section 10.14_; and

 



 

(g) as provided in _Section 10.15_

 



 

this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than Allergan
and the AbbVie Parties any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.15** **_Waiver of Claims Against Financing Sources_**. Without
limiting in any respect the liabilities of the Financing Sources to AbbVie or
its Affiliates, or the remedies of AbbVie or its Affiliates against the
Financing Sources under any other agreement to which they are both parties,
none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Parties or their
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, whether at Law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Parties nor any of
their Affiliates will have any rights or claims against the Financing Sources
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall Allergan or its Affiliates be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against any of the Financing Sources
(it being expressly agreed that the Financing Sources in their capacities as
such shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.15_ and shall be
entitled to enforce the provisions contained in this _Section 10.15_ as if
they were a party to this Agreement).

 



 

 **Section 10.16** **_Non Survival of Representations and Warranties_**. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto
shall not survive the Effective Time or the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Article 9_, except that (i)
_Section 7.3_ and _Article 8_ shall survive the Effective Time, and (ii)
