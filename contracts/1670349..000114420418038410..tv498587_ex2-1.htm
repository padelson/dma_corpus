agreement must be approved by the audit committee of the Parent Board, such
amount(s) as so agreed and the resulting Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount

Company shall acknowledge in writing, and the Aggregate Merger Consideration
Amount set forth in such revised Final Statement shall be final and binding

the end of the Resolution Period, (i) refer the specific amount(s) that remain

determination. Each of Parent and the Seller Representative shall cooperate
with the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with its determination of
the Disputed Amounts and provide the Independent Accounting Firm access to
all information necessary in order to for the Independent Accounting Firm to
make such determination. In making its determination of the Disputed Amounts,

value to any particular Disputed Amount greater than the greatest value for
such Disputed Amount claimed by Parent or the Seller Representative or less
than the lowest value for such Disputed Amount claimed by Parent or the Seller
Representative (except to the extent that the resolution of a Disputed Amount
results in a corresponding change to any other amount) and (ii) shall make
such determination in a manner that is consistent in all respects with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and shall not have the power
to modify, amend or deviate from any term or provision of this Agreement.
Parent shall bear and pay all of the fees and other costs charged by the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm's determination
of the Disputed Amounts shall be final and binding upon the Parties, the
Blocker Stockholders and the Non-Blocker Company Members for all purposes

Disputed Amounts, the Closing Net Debt Amount, the Closing Working Capital
Amount, the Approved Growth Capex Amount and the Closing Adjusted Net Debt
Amount and the resulting Adjustment Amount and Aggregate Merger Consideration
Amount, calculated in accordance with the Independent Accounting Firm's
determination of the Disputed Amounts (and as otherwise previously deemed
final), shall be set forth in a revised Final Statement, which each of Parent
and the Seller Representative shall acknowledge in writing, and the Aggregate
Merger Consideration Amount set forth in such revised Final Statement shall

after such final determination of the Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount:

  



  

(i) Parent shall cancel a number of the shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock issued to each Blocker Stockholder on the Closing Date such that
aggregate number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issued to such
Blocker Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement and not so canceled is equal
to the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock such Blocker
Stockholder would have received on the Closing Date if the finally determined
Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount, rather than the Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration Amount, were used for purposes of determining the number
of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued and delivered on the
Closing Date;

  



    

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) the Company shall cancel a number of the Common Units issued to
each Non-Blocker Company Member on the Closing Date such that
aggregate number of Common Units issued to such Non-Blocker Company Member
pursuant to this Agreement and not so canceled is equal to the number of
Common Units such Non-Blocker Company Member would have received on the
Closing Date if the finally determined Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount,
rather than the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount, were used for
purposes of determining the number of Common Units to be issued and delivered
on the Closing Date;

  



  

(iii) Parent shall cancel a number of the shares of Parent Class B
Common Stock issued to each Non-Blocker Company Member on the Closing
Date equal to the number of Common Units issued by the Company to such Non-
Blocker Company Member on the Closing Date and canceled pursuant to clause
(ii) of this _Section 2.1(e)_ ; and

  



  

(iv) the Company shall cancel a number of Common Units held by Parent
equal to the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
canceled pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section 2.1(e)_.

  



  

The Parties agree that all shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, Common
Units and shares of Parent Class B Common Stock canceled pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(e)_ shall be so canceled and forfeited by the holder thereof,
and such cancelation and forfeiture shall be binding on each Blocker
Stockholder, each Non-Blocker Company Member and Parent, as applicable, and
their respective successors and assigns, automatically and without any action
of any such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
adjustment under this clause (e) result in a cancellation of Parent Class A
Common Stock, Parent Class B Common Stock, or Common Units based on finally
determined Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount that is less than the
Baseline Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount.

  



  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, if the Aggregate Merger
Consideration Amount, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ , is
not greater than or less than the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration
Amount by more than $5,000,000, no issuance or cancelation of shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock, Common Units and shares of Parent Class B Common
Stock shall occur pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.1(e)_ , and no
other adjustment or payment shall be made in respect of the difference between
such finally determined Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount and the
Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount.

  



  

(g) If the applicable Merger Consideration is not issued and
delivered to a Blocker Stockholder or a Non-Blocker Company Member on
the Closing Date pursuant to the last paragraph of _Section 2.9_ or _Section
2.10_ and is later delivered to such Blocker Stockholder or Non-Blocker
Company pursuant to such paragraph, then (i) if such Merger Consideration is
delivered prior to any issuance or cancelation pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_
or _Section 2.1(e)_ , such Merger Consideration shall be deemed for purposes
of _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.1(e)_ , as applicable, to have been issued
and delivered on the Closing Date, and (ii) if such Merger Consideration is
delivered after any issuance or cancelation pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ or
_Section 2.1(e)_ , the amount of such Merger Consideration shall be
determined after giving effect to _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.1(e)_ , as
applicable, rather the amount of such Merger Consideration that otherwise
would have been issued and delivered to such Blocker Stockholder or Non-
Blocker Company Member on the Closing Date.

Blocker Merger as provided in _Section 2.4(b)(i)_ and (ii) the number of
Common Units issuable to the Non-Blocker Company Members pursuant to the

Aggregate Merger Consideration Amount _divided_ by (B) $10.00.

written statement (the " _Merger Consideration Allocation Statement_ ")

(i) for each Company Member the percentage of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration Amount that is allocable to such Company Member (such Company
Member's " _Merger Consideration Percentage_ "), which shall total 100% and
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Company LLC
Agreement governing the allocation of the consideration for an Approved
Sale unless Parent provides its prior written consent to a different basis of
determination (such consent not to be withheld or delayed unreasonably); and

  



  

(ii) for each Blocker Stockholder, the percentage of the Applicable
Blocker Merger Consideration for the applicable Blocker Company that is
allocable to such Blocker Stockholder (for each Blocker Stockholder, its "
_Applicable Blocker Consideration Percentage_ "), which shall total 100% and
shall be determined on the basis of the relative rights of all of the Blocker
Stockholders of such Blocker Company to share in the Applicable Blocker
Merger Consideration based on the number and type of Shares of Capital Stock
of such Blocker Company owned by each of them and, as applicable, the
Organizational Documents of such Blocker Company Member and applicable Law.

shall be used by Parent and Merger Sub for purposes of issuing the Merger
Consideration to the Blocker Stockholders and the Non-Blocker Company Members
pursuant to this _Article II_. In issuing the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this _Article II_ , Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely fully
on the Allocation Percentages set forth in the Merger Consideration Allocation
Statement, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any responsibility for determining or confirming the
Allocation Percentages, nor shall any of them have any liability to any other
Party or any other Person (including any Blocker Stockholder, any Non-
Blocker Company Member or any of their respective owners or Affiliates)
related to such Allocation Percentages or issuance of the
Merger Consideration based on such Allocation Percentages, including if any
of the Allocation Percentages is later established to have been determined
erroneously.

(a) Since March 31, 2017, Parent has timely filed or furnished with
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules and statements required to be filed or
furnished under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (such forms, reports,
schedules and statements, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective dates, each of the Parent SEC Documents, as amended (including,
without limitation, all financial statements included therein, exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein),
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and
none of the Parent SEC Documents contained, when filed or, if amended prior
to the Execution Date, as of the date of such amendment with respect to those
disclosures that are amended, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. To the Knowledge of Parent, as of
the Execution Date, (A) none of the Parent SEC Documents are the subject of
ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment and (B) neither the SEC nor any
other Governmental Authority is conducting any investigation or review of any
Parent SEC Document. No notice of any SEC review or investigation of Parent
or the Parent SEC Documents has been received by Parent as of the Execution
Date.

  



  

(b) The financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents, including all notes and schedules thereto, complied in
all material respects, when filed or if amended prior to the Execution Date,
as of the date of such amendment, with the rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by
Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) and fairly present in all material
respects in accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP (subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments) the
financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as of their
respective dates and the results of operations and the cash flows of Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, for the periods presented therein.

  



  

(c) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the
listing standards of NASDAQ. Parent's disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions.

5.9 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the Execution Date, there is no
Proceeding (filed by any Person other than the Company Parties, the Blocker
Stockholders, the Non-Blocker Company Members or any of their respective
Affiliates) pending or, to Parent's Knowledge, threatened, against Parent or
Merger Sub before or by any Governmental Authority, which seeks an Order
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal any of the
Transactions. There are no, and since their respective dates of formation
there have not been, any other Proceedings pending, or, to Parent's
Knowledge, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub by or before any
Governmental Authority and Parent is not subject to, and no Asset of Parent is
bound or affected by, any outstanding Orders.

  



  

5.10 _Compliance with Laws and Orders_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is and since its respective date of formation has been in compliance in all
material respects with all Laws and Orders applicable to it except where such
non-compliance would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
Liability to Parent or Merger Sub.

  



  

5.11 _Brokers_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any liability or
obligation to pay fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with
respect to the Transactions, other than obligations to pay the Deferred
Underwriting Commission and any amounts payable in connection with the PIPE
Transactions.

  



  

5.12 _Trust Account_. As of the Execution Date, Parent has (and,
assuming no holders of Parent Class A Common Stock exercise the
Parent Stockholder Redemption Right, will have immediately prior to the
Closing) at least $325 million in the Trust Account, with such funds invested
in United States Government securities or money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of
1940 and held in trust by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The
Trust Agreement is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and the Trustee, enforceable in accordance with its
terms. As of the Execution Date, the Trust Agreement has not been terminated,
repudiated, rescinded, amended, supplemented or modified, in any respect, and
no such termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated. As of the Execution Date, there are no side
letters and (except for the Trust Agreement) there are no agreements,
contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, with the
Trustee or any other Person that would (i) cause the description of the
Trust Agreement in the SEC Documents to be inaccurate in any material respect
or (ii) entitle any Person (other than holders of Parent Class A Common Stock
who shall have exercised their Parent Stockholder Redemption Right) to any
portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of
the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except (A) to pay income
and franchise taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust Account and
(B) to redeem shares of Parent Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Parent
Stockholder Redemption Right. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened with respect to the Trust Account.

  



  

5.13 _Information Supplied; Proxy Statement_. The information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at
the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of Parent and
at the time of any meeting of Parent's stockholders to be held in connection
with the Transactions, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement (other than with
respect to information supplied by the Company Entities for inclusion
therein) will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to the Proxy Statement.

5.14 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since March 31, 2017
through the Execution Date, there has not been any Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has conducted any business
other than its formation, the public offering of its securities (and the
related private offerings), the making of public reports under the Exchange
Act and the search for, and preparation for the execution of, a Business
Combination.

  



  

5.15 _No Default_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in default or
violation (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or
provision of (a) the Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (b)
any Contract to which Parent is a party or by which Parent is bound, or (c)
any Law applicable to Parent, except, in the cases of clauses (b) and (c),
for defaults or violations which would not be reasonably likely to have
consequences that would, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
Parent.

  



  

5.16 _Listing_. The issued and outstanding shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock, the Parent Warrants, and the Parent units (consisting of
one share of Parent Class A Common Stock and one Parent Warrant) (the
foregoing, collectively, the " _Parent Public Securities_ ") are registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for trading on
NASDAQ. There is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent by NASDAQ or the SEC with
respect to any intention by such entity to deregister any Parent Public
Securities or prohibit or terminate the listing of any Parent Public
Securities on NASDAQ. Parent has taken no action that is designed to
terminate the registration of Parent Public Securities under the
Exchange Act. Parent has not received any written or, to Parent's Knowledge,
oral deficiency notice from NASDAQ relating to the continued listing
requirements of the Parent Public Securities.

  



  

5.17 _Investment Company_. Parent is not an "investment company"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

  



  

5.18 _Certain Tax Matters_

  

 _ _

  

(a) Parent's and its Subsidiaries' (including Merger Sub's) present
plan and present intention is to continue the historic business of each
Blocker Company and the Company Entities (or use a significant portion of the
Blocker Companies', the Company's and its Subsidiaries' historic business
assets in a business) following the Mergers within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).

  



  

(b) Other than acquisition of shares pursuant to an adjustment to
consideration as contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) have no plan or intention to acquire any
of the shares issued to the Blocker Stockholders in the Merger in exchange
for cash or other assets (other than stock of Parent).

(c) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, Parent has no plan or
intention to dispose of any of its shares or interest in any of its
Subsidiaries or cause any of its Subsidiaries' assets to be sold or
transferred (except in the ordinary course of business).

  



  

(d) To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts or circumstances
that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Blocker Merger with respect
to any Blocker Company from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

5.19 _Parent Contracts_. Except (a) as set forth on _Schedule 5.19_ ,
(b) as filed as exhibits to the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the
Execution Date and (c) for this Agreement and the other Contracts contemplated
by this Agreement, none of Parent or any Merger Sub is party to any material
Contract (other than nondisclosure agreements (containing customary terms) to
which Parent is a party that were entered into in the ordinary course of its
business).

  



  

5.20 _Employee Matters_. Other than the current officers of Parent,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever had any employees. Other
than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent's officers
and directors in connection with activities on Parent\'s behalf in an
aggregate amount not in excess of the amount of cash held by Parent outside of
the Trust Account, Parent has no unsatisfied liability with respect to any of
its officers. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub maintains, sponsors or has
any liability or potential liability with respect to any Benefit Plan.

  



  

5.21 _Investment Matters_. Parent is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Parent is
acquiring the Company Units for its own account for investment and not with a
view to, or for sale or other disposition in connection with, any
distribution of all or any part thereof, except in compliance with applicable
federal and state securities Laws, nor with any present intention of
distributing or selling any of the Company Units except in compliance with
applicable federal and state securities Laws.

  



  

5.22 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. In entering into this
Agreement, Parent has relied solely on the Blocker Companies' and the
Company's express representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_
and _Article IV_ and in the Closing Certificates delivered by the Blocker
Companies and the Company and the Letters of Transmittal, Parent's own
expertise, and Parent's professional counsel as to the Shares of Capital
Stock of the Blocker Companies, the Company Units and the Assets and business
of the Company Entities, and the value thereof, and not on any other comments,
representations, warranties or statements of, or information provided by, the
Blocker Companies, any Company Entity or any Representatives of the foregoing.
Parent acknowledges and affirms that it has completed such independent
investigation, verification, analysis, and evaluation of the Shares of
Capital Stock of the Blocker Companies, the Company Units and the Assets and
business of the Company Entities and has made all such reviews and
inspections of the Shares of Capital Stock of the Blocker Companies, the
Company Units and the Assets and business of the Company Entities as it has
deemed necessary or appropriate to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall in no event limit in any
respect any of the representations or warranties set forth in _Article III_
 or _Article IV_ or in any Closing Certificate delivered by the Blocker
Companies or the Company or the Letters of Transmittal. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly made by the Blocker Companies in
_Article III_ and by the Company in _Article IV_ or in the Closing
Certificates to be delivered by the Blocker Companies and the Company or the
Letters of Transmittal, Parent acknowledges that no Person has made, and
Parent has not relied upon, any representations or warranties, express or
implied, as to the Shares of Capital Stock of the Blocker Companies, the
Company Units or the financial condition, business, operations, prospects,
Assets (including such Assets' physical condition, title and environmental
conditions) or liabilities of any of the Company Entities.

6.4 _D andO Indemnity_. Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation, and advancement of expenses for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the
current or former managers, directors, officers, members or employees of any
of the Company Entities (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ ") as
provided as of the Execution Date in the Organizational Documents of the
Company Entities (including, without limitation, the Company LLC Agreement
notwithstanding the Company Merger) shall survive the Closing and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period
of not less than six years from the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub shall
not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, repeal, amend,
waive or otherwise modify such rights to indemnification, exculpation,
and advancement of expenses in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Company Indemnitees thereunder. Parent or Merger Sub shall,
effective as of the Closing Date, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail"
insurance policies that cover the existing directors and officers of the
Company Entities for a claims-reporting or discovery period of at least six
years from and after the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as Company's existing directors' and officers'
insurance carrier and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less advantageous than the coverage provided under
Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against any of the existing directors or officers of
the Company Entities by reason of his or her service as a director or officer
of any Company Entity at or prior to the Closing Date (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to spend more than 300% (the
" _D andO Cap Amount_") of the last annual premium paid by Company prior to the
Execution Date per year for such coverage under such tail policy; _provided
further_ that if the cost of such insurance exceeds the DandO Cap Amount, and
Parent and Merger Sub elect not to spend more than the DandO Cap Amount for
such purposes, then Parent or Merger Sub shall purchase as much coverage as is
obtainable for the DandO Cap Amount which shall satisfy the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to such tail policy under this _Section
6.4_. From and after the Closing, in the event that Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each
such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.4_.

6.5 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause to be timely filed all
Tax Returns required to be filed by any of the Company Entities or the
Blocker Companies after the Closing Date that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods. Except as required by applicable Law, such Tax Returns that are
Flow-Through Returns shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 6.5_ , consistent with past practices of the Company Entities and in
accordance with applicable Law, and submitted (with copies of any relevant
schedules, work papers and other documentation then available) to the Seller
Representative for its approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not less than 30 days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Tax Return, or, for any such Tax Return
due to be filed within thirty days after the Closing Date, as soon as
practicable after Closing. If the Seller Representative disputes any item on
any Tax Return delivered to it under this _Section 6.5_ , the Seller
Representative shall notify Parent of such disputed item (or items) within
fifteen days and shall provide an explanation of the reason for its objection.
Parent and the Seller Representative shall act in good faith to resolve any
such dispute prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required
to be filed. If Parent and the Seller Representative cannot resolve any
disputed item, the question shall be resolved by an independent accounting
firm of national reputation that is selected by mutual agreement of Parent and
the Seller Representative, and the fees of the such independent accounting
firm shall be borne equally by the Seller Representative and Parent. If any
disputed item has not been resolved by the time a Tax Return is required to
be filed, or the Seller Representative's period for review and objection to
such Tax Return has not expired by the time a Tax Return is required to be
filed, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Parent, and if the
disputed item is resolved thereafter in a manner different than as reflected
on such Tax Return, Parent shall file an amended Tax Return that reflects
such resolution.

  



    

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not allow any of the Company
Entities to, amend any Tax Return of any of the Company Entities for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, or cause or effect any Seller Tax Matter, in each case
without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, which consent
shall not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that
Parent shall not be required to obtain the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative with respect to any Seller Tax Matter that (x) arises
incidentally as a result of Parent's filing of Tax Returns of a Company
Entity with respect to a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date, or (y) is reasonably required in connection with an audit or
other Tax Proceeding initiated by a Taxing Authority.

  



  

(c) Parent and the Seller Representative shall cooperate fully, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by either Parent or the Seller Representative, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ and
any Tax Proceeding with respect to such Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon Parent's or the Seller Representative's
request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  



  

(d) Any Transfer Taxes imposed on the Transactions shall be paid by
the Party responsible for paying such Transfer Taxes under applicable Law.
The Seller Representative and Parent agree to cooperate in the execution and
delivery of all instruments and certificates reasonably necessary to remit
and/or minimize the amount of any Transfer Taxes. Parent shall prepare and
timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) any Tax Returns for
Transfer Taxes as required by Law and shall notify the Seller
Representative when such filings have been made.

  



  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle
Period, (i) any property Taxes and other similar taxes imposed on a
periodic basis for the portion of the Straddle Period that is in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such property Taxes for
such entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days during the Straddle Period that is in a Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period; and (ii) all other Taxes for the portion of the Straddle that is in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an actual closing of the
books used to calculate such Taxes as if such Tax period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date. In the case of clause (ii), exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions computed as if the Closing Date was
the last day of the Straddle Period) shall be allocated between the portion of
the Straddle Period that is in a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of
the Straddle Period thereafter in proportion to the number of days in each
such portion.

(f) _Intended Tax Treatment_.

  



  

(i) The Parties intend that each Blocker Merger will qualify as a
reorganization described in Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, and the Parties
shall report the transactions contemplated in this Agreement consistently with
such treatment on all relevant Tax Returns, and shall take no position
inconsistent with such treatment in any Tax Proceeding with a Taxing Authority
unless required by applicable Law. Neither Parent nor the Blocker
Stockholders shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Blocker Merger with respect to such Blocker Company from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368 and the Treasury Regulation promulgated
thereunder.

  



  

(ii) The Parties agree that, except as required by applicable Law,
for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes, (A) the Company shall be treated as the
continuing partnership pursuant to Section 708(b)(1) of the Code; (B) neither
the shares of Parent Class B Common Stock nor the right to redeem or exchange
Common Units shall be treated as having a fair market value greater than zero
dollars ($0); (C) Parent shall (I) be treated as contributing cash and
property to the Company in exchange for Common Units in a non-
taxable transaction under Section 721(a) of the Code, (II) be treated as
acquiring the Company Warrants in exchange for cash in an amount equal to the
fair market value of such Company Warrants, and (III) not be treated as
receiving any taxable consideration pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-3; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if any taxable
consideration is treated as received by Parent or the Non-Blocker Company
Members, (x) such consideration shall be treated as a reimbursement of
preformation capital expenditures to the maximum extent permitted pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d), and (y) nonrecourse liabilities of
the Company shall be allocated in a manner that is consistent with applicable
Treasury Regulations to minimize, to the greatest extent possible, the amount
of gain that the Non-Blocker Company Members or Parent would recognize, if
any, pursuant to Section 707 of the Code, if applicable, or Section 731(a) of
the Code, in connection with the receipt of such consideration; and (D)
with respect to the IRS Form 1065 (or similar state or local Tax Return)
filed for the Tax year of the Company including the Closing Date, such Tax
Return shall be prepared utilizing the "interim closing method" as if the Tax
year ended on the Closing Date and "calendar day convention" (in each case,
as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.706-4) as of the end of the
Closing Date.

  



  

(iii) The Parties shall (A) prepare and file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with this _Section 6.5(f)_ , and (B) take no
position inconsistent with this _Section 6.5(f)_ in any Tax Return, Tax
Proceeding or otherwise absent a determination within the meaning of Section
1313 of the Code to the contrary.

  



  

(g) If any Taxing Authority issues to Parent or any of the Company
Entities (i) a written notice of its intent to audit or conduct a
Tax Proceeding with respect to Flow-Through Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or (ii) a written notice of deficiency for Taxes for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period relating to Flow-Through Returns (each a " _Tax Contest_ "), Parent
shall notify the Seller Representative of its receipt of such communication
from the Taxing Authority within thirty (30) days of receipt. The Seller
Representative shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to control
the prosecution, settlement or compromise of any such Tax Contest, _provided_
, _however_ , that the Seller Representative shall keep Parent reasonably
informed as to the progress of such Tax Contest and, to the extent that any
such Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
post-Closing impact on Parent or any of the Company Entities, (i) Parent shall
be entitled to participate in any such Tax Contest at its sole cost and
expense and (ii) the Seller Representative shall not settle or otherwise
compromise any such Tax Contest without Parent's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Parent's request, the Company shall make an
election under Section 6226(a) of the Code (or any similar or comparable
election under state or local Law) with respect to any Tax Contest related to
a Flow-Through Return of a Company Entity for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



    

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) The Parties agree that the Company shall use the "traditional
allocation method" as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(b)
(including in connection with any "reverse 704(c) allocation") that may be
required in connection with a "book-up" of the Company's assets in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(i) The obligations of Parent in this _Section 6.5_ shall survive
Closing. To the extent that the provisions of this _Section 6.5_  are
inconsistent with or conflict the provisions of _Article X_ or any other
provisions under this Agreement, the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ shall
control.

  



  

6.6 _Public Announcements_. No Party shall make any public
announcement or issue any public communication regarding this Agreement
or the Transactions without first obtaining the prior written consent, as
applicable, of Parent (if a Company Party is the disclosing Party) or the
Company (if Parent or Merger Sub is the disclosing Party), except if such
announcement or other communication is required by applicable Law (including
in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement and any
offering or other documents prepared in connection with any financing by
Parent) or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party's capital
stock is traded, in which case, to the extent permitted by Law, the disclosing
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate or
communicate such announcement or communication with Parent or the Company, as
applicable, prior to announcement or issuance; _provided_ , _however_ that no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner (i) any
Party's ability to communicate with its employees or equity holders or (ii)
the ability of Parent and the Company to communicate with their financial and
legal advisors, lenders, underwriters or financing sources (including, in the
case of Parent, the PIPE Investors).

  



  

6.7 _The Proxy Statement and the Special Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Execution Date,
but in any event within ten Business Days following the date on which Parent
has received written notice from the Company that the Company believes that
the information required to be provided by the Company Entities hereunder has
been delivered to Parent, Parent will prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement containing the information specified in Schedule 14A of the
Exchange Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Proxy Statement_ ") in preliminary form; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such ten Business Day period shall not elapse if Parent provides a
reasonably detailed written notice to the Company regarding information that
is required but has not yet been received by Parent from the Company for the
Proxy Statement, in which case the ten Business Day period shall re-commence
after Parent receives such information from the Company. Parent shall as
promptly as practicable notify the Company of the receipt of any oral or
written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement and any request
by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information. Parent shall cooperate and provide the Company with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement
(including each amendment or supplement thereto) and all responses
to requests for additional information by and replies to comments of the SEC
and give due consideration to all comments reasonably proposed by the Company
in respect of such documents and responses prior to filing such with or
sending such to the SEC, and the Parties will provide each other with copies
of all such filings made and correspondence with the SEC. The Parent Board
Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement. Parent will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments made by
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent will cause the Proxy
Statement to be transmitted to the Parent Stockholders as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within five Business Days, following the date on
which the SEC confirms it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement.

  



    

 | 80| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Company acknowledges that a substantial portion of the Proxy
Statement and other filings to be made by Parent with the SEC shall include
disclosure regarding the Company Entities and their management, operations and
financial condition. Accordingly, the Company will, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Execution Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide Parent with all information concerning the Company Entities, the
operations of the Company Entities' business and the Company
Entities' management and operations and financial condition, in each case,
required to be included in the Proxy Statement or such other
filings, including the required financial statements of the Company Entities
prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X and a related consent from the
Company Entities' independent public accountants. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company Entities shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with the preparation
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement of pro forma financial statements that
comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the rules and
regulations of the SEC. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause its officers and employees to cooperate with Parent and its counsel
in connection with the drafting of the Proxy Statement and any other filings
to be made by Parent with the SEC and responding in a timely manner to
comments on the Proxy Statement or such other filings from the SEC; _provided_
that doing so does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company Entities.

  



  

(c) Parent will take, in accordance with applicable Law, NASDAQ
rules and the Organizational Documents of Parent, all action necessary
to call, hold and convene a special meeting of holders of Parent Common Stock
(including any permitted adjournment or postponement, the " _Parent
Stockholders Meeting_ ") to consider and vote upon the Parent Stockholder
Proposals as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing of the Proxy
Statement in definitive form with the SEC. Once the Parent
Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, Parent will not postpone or
adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the consent of the Company,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, other
than, (1) for the absence of a quorum, (2) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that
Parent has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal advisors, is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental
or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Parent
Stockholders prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting or (3) an adjournment
or postponement of up to ten Business Days to solicit additional proxies from
of Parent Stockholders. Subject to _Section 6.7(d)_ , Parent will take all
reasonable lawful action to solicit approval of the Parent Stockholder
Proposals and the LTIP Proposal by the Parent Stockholders.

  



    

 | 81| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) The Parent Board will recommend in the Proxy Statement that the
Parent Stockholders approve the Parent Stockholder Proposals (the "
_Parent Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the required stockholder approval at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, the Parent Board may withdraw, modify or qualify in any
manner the Parent Board Recommendation (any such action a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ") if the Parent Board shall have concluded in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors and financial
advisors, that a failure to make a Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ _,_ that the Parent Board shall not be entitled to exercise its
rights to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless (i)
such Change in Recommendation is based upon a material intervening event that
occurred during the Interim Period and constitutes information not available
to the Parent Board at the Execution Date and (ii) Parent has provided to the
Company three Business Days' prior written notice advising the Company that
the Parent Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor in reasonable detail. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, any Change in
Recommendation will not (x) change the approval of this Agreement or any
other approval of the Parent Board or (y) relieve Parent of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, including its obligation to hold the Parent
Stockholders Meeting.

  



  

(e) If at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event,
circumstance or information relating to Parent or the Company Entities, or
any of their respective officers or directors should be discovered by Parent
or the Company, as applicable, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or any other filings to be made by Parent
with the SEC, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC by Parent
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Parent Stockholders;
_provided_ that no information received by Parent pursuant to this _Section
6.7(e)_ shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation,
warranty or agreement given or made hereunder by any Party, and no such
information shall be deemed to change, supplement or amend the Schedules.

  



  

(f) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.13_ , to the
extent Parent has any assets other than its interest in the Trust Account,
Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
Entities for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company Entities in connection with the
cooperation of the Company Entities contemplated by this _Section 6.7_ and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company Entities and their
Representatives and Affiliates from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or out-of-pocket expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the Proxy Statement and any information used in connection
therewith, except for Liabilities of the Company Entities to the extent they
resulted from information provided by the Company Entities specifically for
use in connection with the Proxy Statement containing any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The obligations of Parent in this _Section 6.7_
shall survive Closing.

6.8 _Cooperation on Financing Matters_. Prior to the Closing and in
connection with any financing activities of Parent (including for
these purposes the PIPE Transactions and the reduction or minimization of
exercises of the Parent Stockholder Redemption Right), the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal
and accounting representatives, to provide, in each case at the Company's own
expense ( _provided_ that, if the Closing occurs and any such expenses remain
unpaid at Closing, such expenses shall be Company Transaction Expenses), all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in connection
with completing any financing activities of Parent, which commercially
reasonable efforts shall include, among other things, (i) furnishing Parent
reasonably promptly following Parent's request, with information regarding
the Company Entities (including information to be used in the preparation of
one or more information packages regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of the Company Entities), to the extent reasonably
available to the Company Entities, (ii) causing the Company Entities' senior
management and other representatives with appropriate seniority and expertise
of the Company Entities to participate in a reasonable number of meetings
(including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead-
arrangers, bookrunners or agents for, and prospective lenders of, such
financing), presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with such financing or
maintenance activities, (iii) assisting with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, offering memoranda, and similar documents
required in connection any such financing or maintenance activities, (iv)
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain legal opinions, auditor
comfort letters and auditor consents reasonably requested by Parent in
order to consummate such financing or maintenance activities, (v) taking all
corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably
requested by Parent or any future or existing financing sources of Parent or
the Company Entities to permit the consummation of such financing activities,
(vi) assisting Parent with the repayment, and release of any Liens upon
repayment, of any outstanding Indebtedness of any Company Entity and
obtaining customary payoff letters with respect thereto, and (vii)
cooperating with requests for due diligence to the extent customary and
reasonable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation of the Company
Entities under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be
effective until the Closing and none of the Company Parties or any of their
Representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur
any other Liability prior to Closing in connection with any financing
activities (other than with respect to expenses incurred in accordance with
the first sentence of this _Section 6.8_ ). Subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 11.13_ , to the extent Parent has any assets other than its
interest in the Trust Account, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company Parties, their Subsidiaries, the Contributor and its Representatives
and Affiliates from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or
out-of-pocket expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
any financing activities of Parent and any information used in connection
therewith, except for Liabilities of the Company Entities to the extent they
resulted from information provided by the Company Entities specifically for
use in connection with such financing activity containing any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The obligations of Parent in this _Section 6.8_
shall survive Closing.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.9 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at any time or from time to time after Closing, at
any Party's request and without further consideration, the other Parties
shall (and in the case of Parent, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company
Parties to) execute and deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale,
transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as such Party may reasonably request
in order to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

6.10 _Exclusivity_.

  



  

(a) From the Execution Date until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement, the Company will not, and will cause the other
Company Entities and any of their respective Affiliates and any of their and
their Affiliates' Representatives, not to, and each of the Blocker Companies
will not, and will cause its respective Affiliates and its and its
Affiliates' respective Representatives not to, take any action, directly or
indirectly, to initiate, solicit, facilitate or encourage, participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, enter into any Contract (including any
letter of intent or confidentiality agreement), or furnish to any other

Entity, including pursuant to the respective Organizational Documents thereof
or predecessor agreements thereto (and any breaches thereof), whether in law
or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, in any capacity (the "
_Company Party Released Claims_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and each Company
Entity each agrees not to, and to cause its respective Parent Related Persons
not to, assert any Proceeding against any Company Party or its Company
Related Persons with respect to the Company Released Claims.

11.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Party will
pay its own costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to and
in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Closing occurs, Company
Transaction Expenses shall be paid as provided in _Section 2.7(c)_ or
_Section 2.7(d)_ , as applicable.

  



  

11.4 _Disclosure_. Unless the context otherwise requires, all
capitalized terms used in the Schedules shall have the respective meanings
assigned to such terms in this Agreement. Neither the Schedules, the exhibits
nor any disclosure made in or by virtue of them constitutes or implies any
representation, warranty, or covenant by any Party not expressly set out in
this Agreement, and neither the Schedules, the exhibits, nor any such
disclosure has the effect of, or may be construed as, adding to, broadening,
deleting from or revising the scope of any of the representations,
warranties, or covenants of any Party in the Agreement. Any item or matter
disclosed or listed on any particular Schedule is deemed to be disclosed or
listed on any other Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent that
such item relates or is applicable to, or is properly disclosed under, such
other Schedule or the section of this Agreement to which such other Schedule
corresponds, notwithstanding the fact that the Schedules are arranged to
correspond to the sections of the Agreement or that a particular section of
this Agreement makes reference to a particular Schedule. Matters reflected
in the Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by the
Agreement to be reflected in the Schedules. The fact that any item of
information is contained in the Schedules is not an admission of liability
under any applicable Law, and does not mean that such information is
material, but rather is intended only to qualify the representations,
warranties and covenants in the Agreement and to set forth other information
required by the Agreement. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply
that such amount, or a higher or lower amount, or the item so included, or
any other item, is or is not material, and no Party shall use the
specification of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between or among the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Schedules
is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. The information set
forth on the Schedules or exhibits shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the terms "material", "materially", "materiality", "Material
Adverse Effect", or any similar qualification in this Agreement. Neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules is intended to imply that such item or matter, or
another item or matter, is or is not in the ordinary course of business, and
no Party shall use the specification or the inclusion of any such item or
matter in any dispute or controversy between or among the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter described or not described herein or
included or not included in the Schedules is or is not in the ordinary course
of business for purposes of the Agreement. Headings have been inserted in the
Schedules for reference only and do not amend the descriptions of the
disclosed items set forth in the Agreement.

11.5 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived
at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or
any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law, will, subject to _Section
9.2_ , be cumulative and not alternative.

  



  

11.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or
modified only by a written instrument duly executed by each of the Parties.

  



  

11.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. Except for the provisions of the
last sentence of _Section 6.2(a)_ , _Section 6.2(c)_ ,  _Section 6.4_,
_Section 6.7(f)_ , the second to last sentence of _Section 6.8_ , and _Section
11.3_ (which are intended to be for the benefit of the Persons identified
therein), the terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors or permitted
assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party
beneficiary rights upon any other Person; _provided_ that only Parent and the
Company (and their respective successors and assigns) will have the right to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its behalf or on behalf of any of
its related indemnitees (but shall not be obligated to do so).

  



  

11.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Any Party may assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate but such assignment shall not release
such Party from its obligations hereunder. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Party, and any attempt to do so will be void, except for
assignments and transfers by operation of Law. Subject to this _Section 11.8_
, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable
by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

11.9 _Headings_. The headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and do not modify, define or limit
any of the terms or provisions hereof.

  



  

11.10 _Invalid Provisions_. Upon any determination that any term or
other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced under any applicable rule of Law or public policy, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

11.11 _Counterparts; Facsimile_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile or
.pdf copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed
originals.

11.12 _Governing Law; Venue; and Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of New York (without regard to any conflict of
laws principles thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that matters contemplated
by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Mergers, the issuance
of shares of Capital Stock of Parent or Merger Sub, matters related to or
governed by the Organizational Documents of entities organized under Delaware
Law, the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the related vote of the Parent
Stockholders) that, by their nature, are governed by Delaware Law shall be
governed by Delaware Law. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any
legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions
shall be brought and determined by courts of the State of New York located in
the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York and the federal courts of the
United States of America located in the State of New York, Southern District,
and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts solely in respect of any legal proceeding arising out of or
related to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that the Parties shall
not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of this Agreement or
the Transactions in any court or jurisdiction other than the above specified
courts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit
the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of judgment in any other
jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that
a final and nonappealable judgment against a Party in any action or proceeding
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
of such judgment.

  



  

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION
OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM
RELATED THERETO.

  



  

11.13 _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus
of Parent, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-216076) (the " _Prospectus_
"), and dated as of March 9, 2017. Each of the Company Parties acknowledges
that it has read the Prospectus and understands that Parent has established
the Trust Account containing the proceeds of its initial public offering (the
" _IPO_ ") and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with
the IPO initially in an amount of approximately $325,000,000 million for the
benefit of Parent's public stockholders and certain parties (including the
underwriters of the IPO) and that Parent may disburse monies from the Trust
Account only: (a) to Parent's public stockholders in the event they elect to
exercise their Parent Stockholder Redemption Right, (b) to Parent's public
stockholders if Parent fails to consummate a Business Combination within
twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the IPO, (c) to pay any Income Tax
due with respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust
Account or (d) to Parent after or concurrently with the consummation of a
Business Combination. For and in consideration of Parent entering into this
Agreement with the Company Parties regarding the Transactions, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, each of the Company Parties hereby agrees on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, it does not now and shall not at any time
hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim
against, the Trust Account, regardless of whether such claim arises as a
result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or
actual business relationship between Parent, the Company Parties, the Company
Entities, the Company Members or the Blocker Stockholders, this Agreement or
any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on
contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability. Each of the
Company Parties hereby irrevocably waives any such claims it may have against
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future
as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements
with Parent and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including
any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an
alleged breach of this Agreement). Each of the Company Parties agrees and
acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and
specifically relied upon by Parent to induce it to enter in this Agreement,
and each of the Company Parties further intends and understands such waiver
to be valid, binding and enforceable under applicable Law. To the extent any
Company Party commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection
with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Parent, which
proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against Parent, such
Company Party hereby acknowledges and agrees its sole remedy shall be against
funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit
such Company Party (or any party claiming on such Person's behalf) to have
any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or
any amounts contained therein; _provided_ that (i) nothing herein shall serve
to limit or prohibit the Company Parties' right to pursue a claim against
Parent for legal relief against assets held outside the Trust Account, for
specific performance or other equitable relief, and (ii) nothing herein shall
serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company Parties may have in
the future against Parent's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust
Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account
and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds). In
the event any Company Party or any of their respective Affiliates commences
any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or
arising out of any matter relating to Parent, which proceeding seeks, in
whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom), whether in the form of money damages or injunctive
relief, Parent shall be entitled to recover from such Company Party, as
applicable, the associated legal fees and costs in connection with any such
action, in the event Parent prevails in such action or Proceeding.

Represented Persons, provided that at such time the Represented Persons have

Affiliates and Representatives and any other Person dealing with the Seller

but, to the fullest extent permitted by law, this _Section 11.14_ shall be
binding on each Represented Person, with or without delivery by such
Represented Person of a Letter of Transmittal, by virtue of the execution and
delivery by the Parties of this Agreement, the Mergers and the
consummation of the Transactions.
