record by The Depository Trust Company ("Book-Entry Shares"), other than

representing Excluded Shares, Common Shares that are Restricted Shares (which
shall be treated in accordance with Section 4.3(b)), Dissenting Shares or
Common Shares described in Section 4.1(b)(iii) or Section 4.1(b)(iv) below,

IV, including the surrender of any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(d)) relating to any such Certificated
Shares or transfer of any such Uncertificated Shares or any such Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this Article IV. Any Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender of any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(d)) or the transfer of any Uncertificated Share or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Certificated Share, Uncertificated Share or Book-
Entry Share.

(ii)Each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, shall no longer be outstanding and

exist.

(iii)Each Common Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent
(other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without
payment of any consideration in exchange therefor or in respect thereof, be
retained by such Subsidiary of the Company or Parent and recapitalized into
such number of shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation such that
each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

shall, without payment of any consideration in exchange therefor or in respect
thereof, be retained by Volt and recapitalized into such number of shares of

immediately following the Effective Time as Volt owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c)Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one (1) newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable

(i)Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") and
the parties shall enter into a written agreement with the Paying Agent in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company relating to the
services to be performed by the Paying Agent to act as agent for the holders
of Common Shares in connection with the Merger. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent,
separate and apart from the Paying Agent's other funds, for the benefit of
holders of Certificated Shares, Uncertificated Shares and Book-Entry Shares
(other than to the extent of any income on such account, which shall be paid
in accordance with clause (ii) below), cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate Merger Consideration which such holders are entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article IV (such cash, the "Merger Fund"). Parent shall cause
the Merger Fund to be (x) held for the benefit of the holders of Certificated
Shares, Uncertificated Shares and Book-Entry Shares and (y) applied promptly
to making the payments pursuant to Section 4.1(a). The Merger Fund shall not

Agent.

(ii)The Merger Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (A) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (B) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for payment of all principal and interest or (C) commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moody's or SandP or a combination
thereof, as directed by and for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation;
provided, however, that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the holders of Common Shares following completion of the Merger
pursuant to this Article IV or otherwise relieve Parent or the Paying Agent
from making the payments required by this Article IV, and Parent shall take
all actions necessary to ensure that the Merger Fund includes at all times
cash sufficient to satisfy Parent's obligation under this Article IV. Any and
all interest and other income earned on the Merger Fund will be payable to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, at Parent's election.

(iii)As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more
than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of
Uncertificated Shares, Excluded Shares, Common Shares that are Restricted
Shares (which shall be treated in accordance with Section 4.3(b)), Dissenting
Shares and Common Shares described in Section 4.1(b)(iii) or Section
4.1(b)(iv)) (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form,
shall be approved by the Company and Parent, and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificated Shares and
Certificates, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper receipt of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(d))) or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, by the
Paying Agent, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(d)) or transfer 

of Book-Entry Shares (including customary provisions with respect to delivery
of an "agent's message" (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as Parent
or Paying Agent may reasonably request) with respect to Book-Entry Shares) in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(iv)Upon (x) physical surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(d)) to the Paying Agent, together with a
duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and other required
documents, or (y) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent to
effect the transfer and cancellation of the Book-Entry Shares (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as Parent or Paying Agent may reasonably
request), in each case in accordance with the terms of the letter of
transmittal and instructions thereto, the holder of the Certificated Shares
relating to such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(d)) or such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall direct the Paying Agent to pay,
in exchange therefor, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of such
Certificated Shares or Book-Entry Shares, either by wire transfer of
immediately available funds or in the form of a check to be mailed, as
provided in the instructions delivered by or on behalf of the holder of such
Certificated Shares or Book-Entry Shares, within three (3) Business Days of
receipt by the Paying Agent of (A) such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(d)), together with such duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other required documents,
or (B) receipt of such "agent's message" by the Paying Agent to effect the
transfer and cancellation of such Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably request), and
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any amount payable upon the
surrender of any Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(d)) or the transfer of any Book-Entry Shares.

(v)As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more
than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
Uncertificated Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) (i) materials advising such holder of the occurrence of the Effective
Time and the conversion of his, her or its Common Shares into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Uncertificated Shares (which shall include evidence as
Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably request of such surrender). Upon
receipt of documentation regarding the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares
by the Paying Agent to effect the transfer and cancellation of the
Uncertificated Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as Parent
or Paying Agent may reasonably request), in each case in accordance with the
terms of the instructions thereto, the holder of the Uncertificated Shares
shall be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall direct the
Paying Agent to pay, in exchange therefor, cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of such Uncertificated Shares, either by wire transfer of immediately
available funds or in the form of a check to be mailed, as provided in the
instructions delivered by or on behalf of the holder of such Uncertificated 

Shares, within three (3) Business Days of receipt by the Paying Agent of such
documentation and, if applicable, such other evidence and the Uncertificated
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrue on any amount payable upon the transfer of any Uncertificated Shares.

(vi)In the event of a transfer of ownership of Certificated Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, upon due surrender of the
Certificate(s) relating to such Common Shares, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Common Shares may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate(s) so surrendered
is or are registered if such Certificate(s) formerly representing such Common
Shares shall be presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer, and shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

(b)Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be marked canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article IV.

(c)Termination of Merger Fund. Any portion of the Merger Fund that remains
unclaimed by the former holders of Common Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time and other eligible Persons in accordance with this Article IV
following one (1) year after the Effective Time may, upon written request by
the Surviving Corporation to the Paying Agent, be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, and any such holder or eligible Person who has not previously
complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable, for payment of
any such holder's or eligible Person's claim for the Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of Common Shares to the Surviving
Corporation.

(d)Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the delivery to the Paying Agent
(together with any other documents required pursuant to Section 4.2(a)) of an
affidavit in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent or the
Paying Agent of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary and reasonable amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the
Merger Fund and subject to Section 2.2, the Surviving Corporation) will issue
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificated Shares
formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in
accordance with this Article IV. Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of
such bond shall be deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the
relevant Common Shares for purposes of this Article IV. 

(e)Withholding Taxes. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, its
Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Merger Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any former holder of Common Shares, Options, Restricted Shares,
Restricted Stock Units or Performance Stock Units such amounts as Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"),
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, its
Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent and then remitted to the relevant Taxing
Authority on behalf of the former holder of Common Shares, Options, Restricted
Shares, Restricted Stock Units or Performance Stock Units, such withheld and
remitted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the former holder of Common Shares, Options, Restricted Shares,
Restricted Stock Units or Performance Stock Units in respect of which such
deduction, withholding and remittance to the relevant Taxing Authority was
made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, its Subsidiaries and the Paying Agent shall, to the extent
reasonably requested, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with each other and with the former holders of Common Shares, Options,
Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units or Performance Stock Units in the
collection, preparation and filing of any forms or other documentation
relating to any claim of exemption or relief from any requirement to withhold
so as to eliminate or minimize to the greatest extent possible any such
requirement.

(f)No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



Section 4.3 Treatment of Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units
and Performance Stock Units.

(a) Options. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of
any Common Shares or Options, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be fully vested, shall be
canceled and shall, in exchange therefor, be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with Section 4.2(e) with respect to such
payment) determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of such Option by
(ii) the number of Common Shares subject to such Option. From and after the
Effective Time, any such canceled Option shall no longer be exercisable by the
former holder thereof, but shall entitle such holder only to the payment of
the amount set forth in this Section 4.3(a). 



(b)Restricted Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any holder of any Common Shares or Restricted Shares, each Restricted Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) shall be fully vested, shall be canceled and retired, shall cease to
exist and shall, in exchange therefor, be converted into the right to receive,
in respect of each underlying Common Share, an amount in cash (without
interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance
with Section 4.2(e) with respect to such payment) equal to the Merger
Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, any such canceled and
retired Restricted Shares shall entitle such holder only to the payment of the
amount set forth in this Section 4.3(b).

(c)Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any holder of any Common Shares or Restricted Stock Units, each Restricted
Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested
or unvested) shall be fully vested, shall be canceled and shall, in exchange
therefor, be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance
with Section 4.2(e) with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying
(i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of Common Shares subject to
such Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, any such canceled Restricted Stock Units shall
entitle such holder only to the payment of the amount set forth in this
Section 4.3(c).

(d)Performance Stock Units. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any holder of any Common Shares or Performance Stock Units, each Performance
Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested
or unvested) shall be fully vested, shall be canceled and shall, in exchange
therefor, be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance
with Section 4.2(e) with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying
(i) the Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of Common Shares subject to
such Performance Stock Unit determined by assuming that performance for the
full or cumulative performance period is the higher of the target and actual
performance (as determined by the Company based upon performance up until the
Closing). From and after the Effective Time, any such canceled Performance
Stock Unit shall entitle such holder only to the payment of the amount set
forth in this Section 4.3(d).

(e)Unless a later time for payment is expressly provided in this Section 4.3
or is otherwise agreed between Parent and an individual holder, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the holders of Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted
Stock Units and Performance Stock Units the cash payments described in this
Section 4.3, together with any dividend or dividend equivalent rights accrued
under any Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock
Units, shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time. 

(f)All payments in respect of Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock
Units or Performance Stock Units and any dividends or dividend equivalent
rights on such awards shall be subject to all applicable withholding in
accordance with Section 4.2(e).

(g)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other
actions the Company Board deems necessary and appropriate to effect the
provisions of this Section 4.3.

Section 4.4 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 4.1(a), but rather,
the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the
appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in
accordance with Section 4.2(e) with respect to such payment (and, at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall
cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL); provided that, if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for, the right (upon the satisfaction of the procedures set forth in
this Article IV with respect to such Dissenting Shares) to receive the Merger
Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in Section 4.1(a).

Section 4.5 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that, at any time
during the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company,
notwithstanding Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c), Section 7.1(e) and Section
7.1(g), changes the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reorganization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Common Shares, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect such change.

Section 4.6 Further Assurances. If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving 

Corporation and their respective officers and directors or managers shall
execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments or
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

amended, as of the date of the last such amendment filed prior to the date
hereof, each Company Report (i) complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), the

regulations of the SEC thereunder, applicable to such Company Report and (ii)
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date hereof, there 

are not any material outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC or its staff and none of the Company Reports are the
subject of ongoing SEC review.

(c)Since December 31, 2015, each of the principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of the Company has made all certifications
required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the

financial reporting" (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company maintains, and at
all times has maintained since January 1, 2016, a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Except as
specially otherwise stated in the Company Reports, from January 1, 2016, to
the date of this Agreement, none of the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the Company's auditors and the Company Board have been advised of,
and the Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have not disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation prior to the
date of this Agreement, to the Company's auditor and the Company Board (i) any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2016,
there have been no material written complaints (and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no other material complaints) from a Governmental Entity regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

Section 5.8 Information in Proxy Statement. None of the information contained
or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement, as of the date it is
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and at the time of the
Company Stockholders' Meeting, will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act. No
representation or warranty is 

made by the Company as to the accuracy of any financial projections or
forward-looking statements therein, or with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB



Except as otherwise disclosed to the Company in the Parent Disclosure Letter,
Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the

of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except, in
the case of clause (c), where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has delivered or
made available to the Company complete and correct copies of the Constituent
Documents of Parent and Merger Sub, as amended and in effect on the date

Section 6.2 Authority for Agreements. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on behalf of Parent 

and Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of either
Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, except

Sub, which will be effected by written consent immediately following the

to, or registration with, any Governmental Entity except for (i) the
Governmental Requirements and (ii) any other such consent, clearance,
expiration or termination of waiting periods, waiver, notice, approval,
authorization, permit, filing, notification or registration, the failure of

not, and the performance of its obligations hereunder will not, (i) violate
any provision of the Constituent Documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii)
result in a violation or breach of any provision of, or constitute (with or

Merger Sub is a party or by which any of them or any of their assets or
properties may be bound, (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any

and permits contemplated in Section 6.3(a) have been obtained, and all
filings, notifications or registrations in Section 6.3(a) have been made,
violate or conflict with any Applicable Law, except, in the case of clauses
(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this Section 6.3(b), for violations, breaches,

creations, impositions or conflicts which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, as of the date
it is first mailed to the 

stockholders of the Company, and at the time of the Company Stockholders'
Meeting, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are

reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

Entity or before any arbitrator) pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against or affecting Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates, the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (b)
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates which, in the case of clause (a) or (b), individually or in the

and the executed fee letter associated therewith and referenced therein
(except that the fee letter is subject to redactions further described below),
as may be amended or modified in accordance with its terms, collectively, the
"Revolver Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which the applicable Debt

conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set
forth therein (the "Revolver Financing") for the purposes of refinancing the
Revolving Credit Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses, (b) the
executed debt commitment letter(s), dated as of the date hereof, between an
Affiliate of Parent and the Debt Financing Sources party thereto (including
all exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto, and the executed fee letter
associated therewith and referenced therein (except that the fee letter is
subject to redactions further described below), as may be amended or modified
in accordance with its terms, collectively, the "Bridge Financing Commitments"
and, together with the Revolver Financing Commitments, the "Debt Financing
Commitments"), pursuant to which the applicable Debt Financing Sources 

party thereto have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set forth therein (the
"Bridge Financing" and, together with the Revolver Financing, the "Debt
Financing") for the purposes of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the related fees and expenses, and (c) the executed equity
commitment letter(s) and subscription agreements, dated as of the date hereof,
among Parent, Guarantor and the other parties thereto (excluding, in the case
of such subscription agreements, the exhibits, schedules, attachments and
annexes thereto, none of which impose additional conditions or expands
existing conditions to the funding of the Equity Financing on the Closing
Date, or impair the availability of the Equity Financing on the Closing Date),
and the executed limited partnership agreement (the "LPA") associated
therewith and referenced therein (but not including any side letters, none of
which impose additional conditions or expands existing conditions to the
funding of the Equity Financing on the Closing Date, or impair the
availability of the Equity Financing on the Closing Date), the "Equity
Financing Commitments" and, together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the
"Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which each such party (including
Guarantor) has committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
invest the cash amount set forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and, together
with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). The Equity Financing Commitments
provide, and will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party
beneficiary thereto with respect to the provisions specified therein. As of
the date hereof, (i) none of the Financing Commitments has been amended or
modified and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated, in each case, that imposes additional conditions or expands
existing conditions to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date, or
impairs the availability of the Financing on the Closing Date, and (ii) the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Except for fee letters (complete copies
of which have been provided to the Company, with only fee amounts and pricing
and other economic terms included in the "market flex" provisions redacted
(provided that Parent represents and warrants that the "market flex"
provisions in such fee letters do not permit the imposition of any new
conditions (or the expansion of any existing conditions) with respect to the
Debt Financing or any reduction in the amount of the Debt Financing from those
contemplated therein on the date hereof)) and customary engagement letters
with respect to the Bridge Financing and side letters to the LPA (none of
which engagement letters and side letters materially and adversely affect the
amount, conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the
Debt Financing or the Equity Financing, as applicable), there are no Contracts
to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that impose conditions,
impair the availability of or modify, amend or expand the conditions to the
funding of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. Parent has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and
Parent will continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid as
and when they become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date. As of
the date hereof, each of the Equity Financing Commitments, in the form so
delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto. As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitments, in the form so
delivered, are legal, valid and binding obligations 

of Parent and/or its applicable Affiliate, as the case may be, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof,
no party to any Financing Commitment has notified Parent, or any of its
Affiliates of its intention to terminate the Financing Commitment or not to
provide the Financing. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
(i) constitute a material default or material breach on the part of Parent or
any of its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto
under any term or condition of any of the Financing Commitments, (ii)
constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or
any of its Affiliates under any of the Financing Commitments or (iii) result
in any portion of the Financing Commitments being unavailable on the Closing
Date (it being understood and agreed that the Revolver Financing will not be
available on the Closing Date if (A) approval by the requisite Revolving
Lenders of the Revolver Amendment is received on or prior to such date and (B)
the Revolver Amendment is executed and delivered by all parties thereto and is
fully effective subject solely to the concurrent closing of the Merger and the
payment of fees under the Revolver Amendment). As of the date hereof, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates has any reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the Financing
Commitments. As of the date hereof, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Financing Commitments, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitments,
together with the cash on hand of the Surviving Corporation, will be
sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to (A) pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 4.1(a) and the other payments under
Article IV and (B) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger
and the Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement
that Parent or Merger Sub obtain the Financing related to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.8 Ownership of Common Shares. Except for the 17,500,000 Common
Shares owned by Volt or as set forth in Section 6.8 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
owns (beneficially or of record) any Common Shares or any option, warrant or
other right to acquire any Common Shares. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is,
and at no time during the last five (5) years has been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, as such quoted term is defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL.

Section 6.9 Operations of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has been formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to
the Effective Time, will have engaged in no other business activities and will
have incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein.
As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of
10,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 100 shares
are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and immediately prior to the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent. 

Section 6.10 Vote/Approval Required. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other
than Merger Sub) is necessary to approve this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, that has not been obtained on or
prior to the date hereof. The adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have occurred concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement) is the only vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to approve this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.



Section 6.11 Brokers. No Person other than Barclays Capital Inc. is entitled
to any brokerage, financial advisory, finder's or similar fee or commission
payable by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub.



Section 6.12 Solvency of the Surviving Corporation Following Merger . Assuming
(i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company made in
this Agreement and any Contract, document or instrument to be delivered by the
Company in connection herewith (disregarding any references to "Knowledge of
the Company," "Company Material Adverse Effect," "materiality" or similar
qualifications contained in such representations), (ii) the compliance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder, (iii) all material contingent
liabilities of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are
disclosed herein, in the Company Disclosure Letter or in the Company Reports,
(iv) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX and (v) that
the most recent projections, forecasts or estimates of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries that have been provided to Parent have been prepared in
good faith based on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable,
immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to the
Merger, the Financing, any Alternative Financing, the payment of the Merger
Consideration, the payment of all related fees and expenses, and any repayment
or refinancing of the Revolving Credit Agreement contemplated in this
Agreement, with the Revolver Financing including all fees and expenses related
thereto (if applicable), Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each of their
Subsidiaries will be Solvent. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Solvent" when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person, on a going concern basis will, as of such date, exceed the sum of
(i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and
other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with Applicable Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, and (ii) to the extent not duplicative of the foregoing
clause (i), the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities
of such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent
and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such
Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses 

in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due.



Section 6.13 Guaranty . Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has caused Guarantor to deliver to the Company a duly executed Guaranty
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Guaranty is in full force and
effect, is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Guarantor and no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of Guarantor under the Guaranty.



Section 6.14 Interest in Competitors. As of the date hereof, except as set
forth in Section 6.14 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub owns any interest(s), nor do any of their respective Affiliates
insofar as such Affiliate-owned interests would be attributed to Parent or
Merger Sub under the HSR Act, in any entity or Person that derives a

misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent

so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement, prepared in accordance with Section
8.2(b), describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and,
to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of
the Company.



Section 8.3 Company Stockholders' Meeting. The Company shall, in accordance

an Alternative Transaction Proposal that did not result from a material breach
of this Section 8.4, the Company and the Company Board may (directly or
through their respective Representatives) (A) contact such Person and its
advisors for the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material terms and

any amended proposal submitted by any Exempted Person, so long as such Person

until the earlier of 12:01 a.m. (New York City time) on the one-hundred and
sixth (106th) day following the date hereof (the "Cut Off Time") and the time

Representatives comply in all material respects with the requirements of this
Section 8.4, including the information requirements of Section 8.4(g).



(c) Except as otherwise provided by this Section 8.4, the Company Board shall
not directly or indirectly: (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify, amend or modify in a
manner materially adverse to Parent) or publicly propose to withdraw (or
qualify, amend or modify in a manner materially adverse to Parent), the
Recommendation or fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
(B) recommend, adopt, approve, endorse or publicly propose to recommend,
adopt, approve or endorse, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, (C) make any
public recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer
other than a recommendation in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9, against any Alternative Transaction Proposal subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act, or (D) if an Alternative Transaction
Proposal other than an Alternative Transaction Proposal subject to Regulation
14D shall have been publicly announced or 

disclosed, fail to recommend against such Alternative Transaction Proposal or
fail to reaffirm the Recommendation on or prior to the earlier of ten (10)
Business Days after such Alternative Transaction Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or disclosed or five (5) Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholders' Meeting (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into or adopt or
approve, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition Contract, option Contract, joint
venture Contract, partnership Contract or other similar Contract, arrangement
or understanding other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (each, an
"Alternative Transaction Agreement") (A) constituting or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to any Alternative Transaction Proposal or (B) requiring
it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Company's compliance
in all material respects with the other provisions of this Section 8.4
(including Section 8.4(e)), as applicable, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to a Superior
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 8.4 or an
Intervening Event, make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and
financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
Applicable Law.



(d) Without limiting Section 8.4(c), in response to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(h)
and this Section 8.4(d) and, concurrently with such termination, may enter
into an Alternative Transaction Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(h) and this Section 8.4(d) unless the
Company (i) complies with its obligations set forth in this Section 8.4
(including Section 8.4(e)) and (ii) pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the
Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 10.3(a)(i) prior to or
concurrently with such termination.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company Board shall not be entitled to either (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 8.4(c) or (y) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(h) and Section 8.4(d), unless (i) the
Company shall have provided to Parent four (4) Business Days' prior written
notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifies in reasonable detail the potential reasons therefor and (A) if
relating to a Superior Proposal, is in accordance with Section 8.4(g) and (B)
if relating to an Intervening Event, reasonably describes the Intervening
Event, and (ii) (A) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have engaged, and shall have caused its
Representatives to engage, in good faith negotiations with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate and so long as Parent
is negotiating in good faith, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the
terms of 

this Agreement, (B) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to
this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other
agreements contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably offered in writing by
Parent during such four (4) Business Day period, (C) (1) with respect to a
Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
adjustments to this Agreement were to be given effect and that failure to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement would continue to
be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, and
(2) with respect to an Intervening Event, the Company Board, after
consultation with the Company's legal counsel and financial advisors, shall
have determined in good faith that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change would continue to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, and (D) in the event of any change to (1) any of the
financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of a Superior Proposal, or (2) the
facts or circumstances relating to an Intervening Event, the Company shall, in
each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (i) above and a new notice period under clause (i) of this
proviso shall commence (except that the four (4) Business Day notice period
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall instead be equal to two (2)
Business Days) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with
the requirements of this Section 8.4(e) anew with respect to such additional
notice, including clauses (i) and (ii) above of this Section 8.4(e); and
provided that the Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 8.4.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company or
the Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, shall be permitted to (i) take or disclose any position or
disclose any information reasonably required under Applicable Law or in
compliance with or otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company's stockholders), and to the extent referred to therein, Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, (ii) make any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company's stockholders) or take a neutral or no position with respect to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, and (iii) waive any "standstill" or similar
provision in order to permit a Person to make an Alternative Transaction
Proposal to the Company Board in a confidential manner, if and only if the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
legal counsel and financial advisors, the failure to so waive would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.



(g) On the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the
number and identity of each of the Exempted Persons from whom the Company or
any of its Representatives has received an Alternative Transaction Proposal or
any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) who inquired about 

or requested information in connection with its consideration of any
Alternative Transaction Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and the material terms and conditions
of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal received (including any changes
thereto). From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt)
notify Parent in writing of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any
inquiry or request for information relating to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, including the identity of the Person making the
Alternative Transaction Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any
such Alternative Transaction Proposal (including an unredacted copy of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, or where such Alternative Transaction
Proposal is not in writing, a description of the terms thereof). The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the
status of discussions or negotiations relating to such Alternative Transaction
Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any proposals, indications
of interest, and/or draft Contracts relating to such Alternative Transaction
Proposal).



Section 8.5 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company, Parent
and Parent's Affiliates, including Merger Sub, shall, without limiting the
proviso to Section 8.5(b), (i) use reasonable best efforts to take all steps
reasonably necessary, and proceed diligently and in good faith, and obtain as
promptly as reasonably practicable any necessary consents, approvals, waivers,
licenses, permits, franchises, certificates, registrations, variances,
exemptions and authorizations of, and actions or nonactions by, and make as
promptly as practicable all necessary filings, submissions and declarations
with, any Governmental Entity or other third party necessary in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, if applicable, requesting expedited treatment for any such filings,
submissions and declarations, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to (A) avoid a
claim, suit, petition to deny, objection, proceeding, investigation or other
action, whether judicial or administrative and whether brought by a
Governmental Entity or other third party, and (B) avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, stay, temporary restraining order
or other order in any such claim, suit, petition to deny, objection,
proceeding, investigation or other action, in each case, challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or that would otherwise
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate any impediment
under any Applicable Law, or any regulatory and operational authorizations and
arrangements necessary to own or operate the assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
(including the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, the
Federal Trade Commission or FERC) or other third party, (iii) use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining which filings,
submissions and declarations are required to be made prior to the Effective
Time with, and which consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, permits,
franchises, certificates, registrations, variances, exemptions or
authorizations, 

actions or non-actions, are required to be obtained prior to the Effective
Time from, Governmental Entities or other third parties in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (B) timely making all such
filings, submissions and declarations and timely seeking all such consents,
approvals, waivers, licenses, permits, franchises, certificates,
registrations, variances, exemptions or authorizations, actions or non-
actions, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the
Merger set forth in Article IX to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and (v) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all other actions and do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each other
in order to do, all other things necessary or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable. In connection with
the foregoing and to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, the Company,
on the one hand, will provide Parent, and Parent, on the other hand, will
provide the Company, with copies of any material correspondence, filing or
communication between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of their respective staffs, on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Prior to submitting or making any such correspondence,
filing or communication to any such Governmental Entity or members of their
respective staffs, the parties shall, to the extent not prohibited by
Applicable Law, first provide the other party with a copy of such
correspondence, filing or communication in draft form and give such other
party a reasonable opportunity to discuss its content before it is submitted
or filed with the relevant Governmental Entities, and shall consider and take
account of all reasonable comments timely made by the other party with respect
thereto. To the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, each of the parties
shall ensure that the other party is given the opportunity to attend any
meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries be
required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other
consideration or incur any liability in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract other than de minimis
amounts or amounts that are advanced or reimbursed substantially
simultaneously by Parent.



(b) For purposes of this Section 8.5, "reasonable best efforts" shall include
(i) vigorously defending, contesting and objecting to any claims, suits,
petitions to deny, objections, proceedings, investigations or other actions,
whether judicial or administrative and whether brought by a Governmental
Entity or any third party challenging this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or that would otherwise prevent or materially impede,
interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) executing settlements,
undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements, (iii)
selling, divesting, holding separate or otherwise conveying any particular

businesses of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing, (vi)
terminating, relinquishing, modifying or waiving existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
its Affiliates, (vii) agreeing to terminate, relinquish, modify or waive

arrangements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary contemporaneously with
or subsequent to the Closing, (viii) creating any relationships, ventures,
contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or its
Affiliates, (ix) agreeing to create any relationships, ventures, contractual
rights, obligations or other arrangements of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Closing, (x) taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom
of action of Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of its or
their businesses, product lines or assets and (xi) taking any other action as
may be required by a Governmental Entity in order to (A) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, permits, franchises, certificates,
registrations, variances, exemptions and authorizations of, and actions and
non-actions by, any Governmental Entity or other third party as promptly as
reasonably possible, but in any event before the Outside Date, or (B) effect
the expiration or termination of any waiting period, which would otherwise
have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date;
provided, however, that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, Parent and
its Affiliates shall not be required to take any such actions contemplated in
clauses (i) through (xi) above which would (1) bind the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in respect of any matter if the Closing does not occur, (2)
require Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to, or
to agree to, sell, divest, hold separate or otherwise convey any material
portion of the Geysers Assets, taken as a whole, contemporaneously with or
subsequent to the Closing, (3) require Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries to, or to agree to, terminate, relinquish, modify or
waive existing material relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other material arrangements relating to the Geysers Assets or
(4) otherwise adversely affect Parent's ability to own or operate the Geysers
Assets in any material respect.



(c) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent agrees (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that are required by Applicable Law to
be a party thereto or supply information or documentary material in connection
therewith) to: (i) file with the United States Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission its Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR

the Merger, as soon as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after the date hereof (or such other period as may be agreed in writing
by the parties); (ii) file with FERC such filings as are required to be made
with respect to the FERC Approval; and (iii) file with the applicable
Governmental Entities such other filings, submissions and declarations as are
required to be made with respect to the approvals set forth in Section 5.5(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter that are required in advance of Closing, in
each case of clauses (ii) and (iii), no later than thirty (30) days after the
date of this Agreement (or such other period as may be agreed in writing by
the parties). 

(d) Any filing fees payable under the HSR Act relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be borne by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable.



(e) Parent agrees to take the actions set forth in Section 8.5(e) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter and that it shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) acquire or agree to acquire any
assets or business or (ii) acquire or agree to acquire, or be acquired or
agree to be acquired by, whether by merger, consolidation, by purchasing any
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or
any Person or division thereof owning, operating or otherwise controlling any
assets or business, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
thereto or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



Section 8.6 Public Announcements; Public Disclosures.



(a) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the press release announcing
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and
shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the Company and Parent.
Following such initial press release announcing the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company will consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or
public statement as may be required by Applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any applicable securities
exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld); provided that the
Company shall be permitted (without consulting with, or obtaining the consent
of, Parent) to make such statements and announcements to its employees as the
Company shall deem to be reasonably necessary. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(a) nothing in this Section 8.6(a) shall limit the Company's or the Company
Board's rights under Section 8.4, (b) the Company will no longer be required
to consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or public
statement if the Company Board has made any Adverse Recommendation Change and
(c) the requirements of this Section 8.6(a) shall not apply to any disclosure
by the Company or Parent of any information concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in connection with any dispute between the
parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing (or anything in
the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary), nothing in this Agreement
shall restrict the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates from making
ordinary course disclosures to current or prospective general or limited
partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of Parent or its
Affiliates, in each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality
restrictions. After the date of this Agreement, Parent shall, upon the
Company's or any credit rating agency's request, make affirmative public
statements regarding its intention to 

maintain the capital structure of the Surviving Corporation in a manner
consistent with Section 8.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.



(b) After the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub, and their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall take any action (including making any
public statements) with the intent of causing a Rating Event or with respect
to which such Party should have reasonably known that such action would cause
a Rating Event.



Section 8.7 Employee Matters.



(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, with respect to each employee of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries who is employed by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Company Employee"), (i) base salary and incentive compensation opportunities
(including annual bonus opportunities and long-term incentive opportunities)
which are no less favorable than the base salary and incentive compensation
opportunities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the value of equity-
based incentive opportunities; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may provide or cause to be provided the value of such equity-based
incentive opportunities in a form other than equity) provided by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to such
Company Employee, (ii) pension and welfare benefits and perquisites that are
no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to such Company
Employee and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that no change-in-
control, special retention or other special or non-recurring compensation or
benefits provided prior to the Closing Date shall be taken into account for
purposes of this covenant; provided, further, however, that nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from terminating the
employment of any Company Employee.



(b) For purposes of vesting, benefit accrual, vacation and sick time credit
and eligibility to participate (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employee after the Effective Time (including the Company Benefit Plans) (the
"New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, 

Parent shall cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, any evidence of insurability
requirements, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Old Plan. Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company
Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year.



(c) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to pay, each Company Employee who is terminated without cause (as
determined pursuant to the applicable Company Benefit Plan or as otherwise
similarly determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in its reasonable
discretion) during the period commencing on Closing and ending on the date on
which bonuses under the annual incentive plans listed in Section 5.16(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter are actually paid, in addition to any severance
to which such Company Employee is otherwise entitled pursuant to any Company
Benefit Plan, a pro-rata bonus for the fiscal year in which the Effective Time
occurs based on the greater of target or actual achievement of pro-rata
performance targets for the number of days that have elapsed in such fiscal
year as of such Company Employee's date of termination, and with the bonus
amount to be the pro-rated portion of a full annual bonus.



(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of
control" within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur upon the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and assume in accordance with their
terms each Company Benefit Plan; provided that nothing herein shall prevent
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company
Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. Parent acknowledges that the
transactions contemplated hereby shall automatically result in an assumption
by the Surviving Corporation of the obligations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries under the collective bargaining agreements set forth on Section
5.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, including the successorship
provisions therein.



(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.7 to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement (i) is intended to create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, any
beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment
and/or benefits that may be provided to any Company 

Employee by Parent or the Company or under any benefit plan which Parent or
the Company may maintain, (ii) shall be treated as an establishment, amendment
or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan
of Parent or the Company or (iii) shall limit the right of Parent or the
Company to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan following the Closing Date.



Section 8.8 Company Indemnification Provisions.



(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee or agent may have under any employment or indemnification
agreement or under the Company's Constituent Documents, this Agreement or, if
applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Company Subsidiaries, from the Effective Time until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each person who was, is at the date of this
Agreement or becomes during the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Closing Date (A) a director or officer of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, (B) a director, officer or trustee of another entity (but only
to the extent that such person is or was serving in such capacity at the
request of the Company) or (C) an employee or agent of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), in connection
with any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental Entity or
any other Person, and whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative
or otherwise, and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties
or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom arising out of acts or
omissions or otherwise relating to, matters that relate to such Indemnified
Party's duties or service as a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent or
fiduciary of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any employee
benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any
of the foregoing or any other Person at or prior to the Effective Time (each,
an "Indemnification Claim") and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within five
(5) Business Days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the
Indemnified Parties any expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness
with respect to or otherwise participating in any Indemnification Claim in
advance of the final disposition of such Indemnification Claim (including
payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights
with respect to such indemnification or advancement relating to such
Indemnification Claim), in each case of (i) and (ii), to the same extent such
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification and/or expense advancement
as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or such Company Subsidiary
pursuant to Applicable Law, the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries'
Constituent Documents or any indemnification agreements in existence on the
date of this Agreement and made available to Parent prior to the date hereof.
The indemnification and advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this Section 8.8(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at
or before the Effective Time and any Indemnification Claim relating thereto
(including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and 

the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
consideration, approval and adoption thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Indemnification Claim relating thereto), and all
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue
as to a person who continues to be or who has ceased to be (A) a director or
officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (B) a director, officer or
trustee of another entity (but only to the extent that such person is or was
serving in such capacity at the request of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary) or (C) an employee or agent of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement, and shall inure to the benefit of
such person's heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives, in each
case, in accordance with the terms hereof. Parent shall not permit the
Surviving Corporation to settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any Indemnification Claim in respect of which indemnification has
been or would reasonably be expected to be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Indemnification Claim and does not include an admission of fault or
wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party, or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents thereto. Parent shall, for the period of time beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, cause the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer and employee
liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than those set
forth in the Constituent Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not, for the period
of time beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this
Section 8.8 shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and
shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries.



(b) The Company may obtain, prior to the Effective Time, a single payment,
run-off policy or policies of directors' and officers', employee practices and
fiduciary liability insurance covering the Persons currently covered by the
Company's existing directors' and officers', employee practices and/or
fiduciary liability insurance policies for claims arising in respect of actual
or alleged errors, misstatements, acts, omissions or any matter claimed
against any such Person occurring prior to the Effective Time in amount and
scope no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the Company's existing
policies, such policy or policies to become effective at the Effective Time
and remain in effect for a period of six (6) years following the Effective
Time; provided, however, that the premium for such run-off policy or policies
shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts
currently paid by the Company to maintain its existing directors' and
officers', employee practices and fiduciary liability insurance policies. If
such run-off policy or policies shall have been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy or policies to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving 

Corporation. If the Company for any reason does not obtain such run-off policy
or policies as of the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, and remain in effect for a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time such run-off policy or policies from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier; provided, however, that, if such run-off policy or
policies cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate
premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of such amount, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall only be required to
obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying a premium equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of such amount.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this Section 8.8(c).

(d) The provisions of this Section 8.8(d) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their respective Representatives. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 8.8 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and
severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Subsidiaries. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 8.8.

Section 8.9 Merger Sub. Parent shall take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub to comply with this Agreement, perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, in each case, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any
investments, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness or liabilities, in each
case, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.10 State Takeover Laws. None of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or the Company Board shall take any action that would result in
any "fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition"
statute or other similar statute or regulation (collectively, "Anti-Takeover
Laws") becoming applicable to the Merger and, if any Anti-Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to the Merger, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on the Merger.

Section 8.11 Financing.

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use 

their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments (including complying
with any request exercising so-called "market flex" provisions contained
therein and paying for any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of the
Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries contemplated herein or therein in
full, including all fees and expenses related thereto), including using their
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions and material obligations applicable to Parent
and its Affiliates to obtaining the Financing (including by consummating the
Equity Financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments),
(iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on terms and conditions that, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments so that such agreements are effective no later than the
Closing, (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, (v)
seek to enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments in the event
of a breach thereof by the applicable Debt Financing Sources and (vi) in the
event that all conditions in the Debt Financing Commitments (other than the
availability or funding of any Equity Financing) have been satisfied, seek to
cause the lenders and other Persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the
Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and the
other transaction contemplated hereby. Parent shall keep the Company informed,
upon reasonable request, with respect to all material activity concerning the
status of the Financing and provide to the Company copies of substantially
final and final drafts of the definitive documents for the Financing and shall
give the Company prompt written notice (A) of any material breach or default
(or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or
default) by any party to any Financing Commitment or definitive document
related to the Financing of which Parent or any of its Affiliates become aware
and (B) of the receipt by Parent of any notice or other communication from any
party to any Financing Commitment with respect to any material breach, default
or repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to any Financing
Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or any
provisions of the Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to
the Financing (it being understood that any breach or default under any
Financing Commitment that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or
delay in any material respect the availability of the Financing or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or result in
any condition precedent to the Financing not being satisfied shall be deemed
to be material for purposes of this sentence). Parent and its Affiliates shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), agree to any amendment, supplement, or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing if such amendment, supplement, or modification would (A) reduce (or
have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing such that,
after taking into account any equity contributions, co-investments or
alternative financing expected to be made and Parent's cash on hand, Parent
does not have sufficient cash proceeds to consummate the Merger or (B) add
conditions to 

the Financing or amend, replace, supplement or modify any conditions to the
Financing relative to the conditions in the Financing Commitments as in effect
as of the date hereof, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impair or delay the availability of the
Financing or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement when required pursuant to Section 2.2; provided that the Debt
Financing Commitments may be amended to add or substitute additional Debt
Financing Sources to the extent any such amendment would not result in any of
the matters described in sub-clauses (A) and (B) above, (C) adversely affect
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce or cause the enforcement of
their respective rights under the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive
documents with respect to the Debt Financing relative to their respective
ability to enforce or cause the enforcement of their rights under the Debt
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing as of the date hereof or (D) prevent or materially impair or delay
the availability of the Bridge Financing or the consummation of the Merger
when required pursuant to Section 2.2. Parent shall furnish to the Company a
copy of any amendment, supplement, replacement, modification, waiver or
consent of or relating to the Financing Commitments reasonably promptly upon
execution thereof, and the term "Financing Commitments" shall mean the
Financing Commitments as so amended, supplemented, replaced or modified,
including any Alternative Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are
not contingent on Parent or Merger Sub's ability to obtain the financing (or
any alternative financing) or any specific term with respect to such
financing. From and after the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, in the event any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "market flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments for any reason, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing and (B) Parent and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from the same or
alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing") in an amount that, after
taking into account any equity contributions, co-investments or alternative
financings expected to be made and Parent's cash on hand, is sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly following
the occurrence of such event, which Alternative Financing would not reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially impair or delay the consummation of the
Merger when required pursuant to Section 2.2. For the purposes of this Section
8.11, any reference to "Debt Financing," "Financing" or "Debt Financing
Commitments" shall include any Alternative Financing required by this Section
8.11. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed to have complied with its obligations
under this Section 8.11 for all purposes of this Agreement if the Closing
shall have occurred. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
Parent and Merger Sub, at Parent's sole cost and expense, cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement, placement
or completion of the Equity Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) Parent and/or its Affiliates may replace,
amend, amend and restate, supplement, modify or terminate the Bridge Financing
Commitment and/or or any definitive documents relating to the Bridge Financing
Commitment (including the Bridge Financing Commitments) to reduce or terminate
(as 

applicable) the commitments thereunder on a proportionate basis in connection
with any additional equity commitments raised by Parent and/or its affiliates
at any time between the date hereof and Closing, and (ii) Parent's and its
Affiliates' obligations (if any) with respect to the Revolving Financing shall
be deemed satisfied in full, and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any further obligations in respect thereof, if (A) approval by the
requisite Revolving Lenders of the Revolver Amendment is received on or prior
to Closing and (B) the Revolver Amendment is executed and delivered by all
parties thereto and is fully effective subject solely to the concurrent
closing of the Merger and the payment of fees under the Revolver Amendment
(and all representations and warranties by or on behalf of Parent and/or its
Affiliates with respect to the Revolver Financing, the Revolver Financing
Commitments and the transactions contemplated by the foregoing shall be deemed
qualified in all respects by the foregoing).



(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Related Parties to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent
and Merger Sub, at Parent's sole cost and expense, cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement, syndication, placement
or completion of the Debt Financing, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with
the Debt Financing, (ii) assist Parent and the Debt Financing Sources in the
preparation of (A) any bank information memoranda (including the delivery of
customary authorization letters) and similar marketing documents and (B)
materials for rating agency presentations, in each case, including public and
private versions of such documents (to the extent applicable), and in
connection with the marketing, syndication and arrangement of, and/or
satisfying the conditions to the Debt Financing that are within the Company's
control, (iii) reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of Parent and
the Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing, (iv) assist
Parent in connection with the preparation of an appropriately completed
joinder substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) (it being understood that the
effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after,
the occurrence of the Closing and no liability shall be imposed on the Company
or officers or employees involved), (v) provide, subject to a request made no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, at least three (3)
Business Days in advance of Closing, to Parent, any Debt Financing Source or
any their respective stockholders, members, partners, managers, officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, successors or
permitted assigns who have a need to know and who are subject to appropriate
confidentiality obligations such information in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, with financial and other information
(including "know your customer" information and information related to anti-
money laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act and other
similar information) in the Company's possession, including all financial
statements, financial data and audit reports of the type reasonably requested
by Parent or the Debt Financing Sources; and (vi) solely with respect to the
Revolving Credit Agreement, if the required revolving lender consent to effect
the Revolver Amendment is not obtained in advance thereof, deliver notices of
prepayment within the time period required by the Revolving Credit Agreement. 

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Parent and Merger Sub will
control and manage all aspects of the Revolver Amendment (including the terms
and conditions thereof, and any fees and concessions related thereto) so long
as the Revolver Amendment does not become fully effective until the Closing;
provided that Parent and Merger Sub will reasonably consult with the Company
regarding the Revolver Amendment, and give the Company the opportunity to
review and comment upon any proposed draft of the Revolver Amendment, which
comments Parent and Merger Sub shall consider and implement in good faith.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parent's sole cost and
expense, cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Revolver Amendment and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Engagement Letter, which cooperation shall include, (i) maintaining in
effect the Engagement Letter, enforcing its rights thereunder and satisfying
on a timely basis, and otherwise complying with, all conditions and
obligations therein applicable to the Company, (ii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in the consummation and effectiveness of the
Revolver Amendment (including by reasonably cooperating with Parent and Merger
Sub to (A) facilitate direct communication among Parent, the arrangers under
the Engagement Letter and Revolving Lenders, (B) assist with the process of
obtaining approval of the Revolver Amendment from Revolving Lenders, (C)
assist in the preparation of any bank information memoranda (including the
delivery of customary authorization letters) and similar marketing documents
(including public and private versions of such documents to the extent
applicable), and (D) participate in a reasonable number of lender meetings and
presentations, in each case, in connection with the Revolver Amendment, (iii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub
to provide, execute and deliver (or furnish, as applicable) the Revolver
Amendment, reaffirmation documents, commitment reduction notices and such
other documents and instruments as are reasonably requested by Parent or the
parties to the Engagement Letter in connection with the Revolver Amendment, in
each case, in such forms as shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, and
providing all documentation and other information required by bank regulatory
authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act and (iv) if requested by
Parent, reasonably cooperating with Parent to cause, at or prior to Closing,
the administrative agent and the collateral agent under the Revolving Credit
Agreement to execute and deliver the Revolver Amendment so long as
effectiveness of the Revolving Credit Agreement is conditioned upon the
Closing.



(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business and operations of the Company
or any of its Affiliates, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other fee
or incur any other liability or obligation or agree to provide any indemnity
in connection with the Debt Financing or the Revolver Amendment unless and
until the Closing occurs, (iii) Parent shall be solely responsible for
Barclays Bank PLC's legal fees and expenses due and owing under the Engagement
Letter and (iv) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action that would (x) be beyond the reasonable control of
the Company, (y) conflict with or violate the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
Constituent Documents or any Applicable Laws or (z) 

impose personal liability on the Company's or its Subsidiaries' respective
officers or employees involved. The Company hereby consents to the use of its
and its Subsidiaries' logos in marketing materials prepared in connection with
the Revolver Amendment and the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are
used in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably expected to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

respect to all material activity concerning the status of the transactions
contemplated by the Engagement Letter and provide to Parent with copies of the
definitive documents for the transactions contemplated by the Engagement
Letter and shall give Parent prompt written notice (i) of any breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default) by any party to the Engagement Letter or definitive document related
to the transactions contemplated by the Engagement Letter of which the Company
becomes aware and (ii) of the receipt by the Company of any notice or other
communication from any party to the Engagement Letter with respect to any
breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or termination by any party to the
Engagement Letter or any definitive document related to the transactions
contemplated by the Engagement Letter of any provisions of the Engagement
Letter or any definitive document related to the transactions contemplated
thereby. The Company shall not agree to any amendment, supplement, or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Engagement Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the
transactions contemplated thereby without Parent's prior written consent.

Related Parties from and against any and all damages suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the
performance of their respective obligations under Section 8.11(b), Section

Company Related Party as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented costs and

Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status of
discussions or negotiations relating to such investment.

Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and the Company

ARTICLE X



TERMINATION

Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after approval of matters presented in connection with the
Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof (except as otherwise expressly noted):

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;



(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the date that is twelve (12) months after the date
hereof (as such date may be extended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent, the "Outside
Date"); provided, however, if all of the conditions to Closing, other than the
condition set forth in Section 9.1(a), shall have been satisfied, shall be
capable of being satisfied at such time or would be capable of being satisfied
at such time but for the fact that the condition set forth in Section 9.1(a)
is not satisfied, the Outside Date may be extended by either the Company or
Parent from time to time by written notice to the other party up to a date not
beyond the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date hereof; provided,
further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b)
shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement was the primary cause of the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before such date; provided, further, that the parties
agree that no party shall have any right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 10.1(b) during the pendency of a legal proceeding by any party
for specific performance pursuant to Section 11.11;

(c) by Parent, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

(d) by Parent or the Company, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained at the Company Stockholders' Meeting or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof;

(e) by Parent or the Company, if any Restraint shall be in effect permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the Merger
and such Restraint is or shall have become final and non-appealable; provided,
however, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(e) shall have complied with its obligations under Section 8.5 to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any such Restraint; and
provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.1(e) shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such
final and non-appealable Restraint was primarily attributable to the failure
of such party, 

and in the case of Parent, including the failure of Merger Sub, to perform any
of its obligations under this Agreement;



(f) by the Company, if prior to the Closing Date there shall have been a
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent or Merger Sub has
failed to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, which breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply
(i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 9.1 or
Section 9.2 and (ii) is incapable of being cured or, if curable, is not cured
by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, on or before the earlier of (A)
the Outside Date and (B) the date that is forty-five (45) days following the
receipt by Parent of written notice from the Company of such breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply; provided that the Company is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement;



(g) by Parent, if prior to the Closing Date there shall have been a breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement on
the part of the Company or the Company has failed to perform or comply with
any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply (i) would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.3 and (ii) is incapable
of being cured or, if curable, is not cured by the Company on or before the
earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B) the date that is forty-five (45) days
following the receipt by the Company of written notice from Parent of such
breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform or comply; provided that Parent or
Merger Sub is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;



(h) by the Company, if, at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal,
(ii) the Company is in compliance in all material respects with Section 8.4,
(iii) to the extent permitted by and effected in accordance with Section
8.4(d), the Company Board approves, and the Company concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement, enters into, an Alternative Transaction
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and (iv) the Company pays
Parent the applicable termination fee set forth in and pursuant to the terms
of Section 10.3 concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to) such
termination;



(i) by the Company, (i) if all of the conditions set forth in Section 9.1 and
Section 9.3 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the Merger within three (3) Business Days following the date on
which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.2 and (iii) the
Company has delivered written confirmation to Parent that it stands ready and
willing to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on such
date and through the end of such three (3) Business Day period;





(j) by Parent, within ten (10) Business Days thereof, if any Rating Event
shall have occurred; and



(k) by the Company, if Parent or its Affiliates shall have breached any of
their covenants or agreements contained in Section 8.5 in any material
respect, which breach is incapable of being cured or, if curable, is not cured
by Parent or its Affiliates on or before the earlier of (i) the Outside Date
and (ii) the date that is forty-five (45) days following the receipt by Parent
of written notice from the Company of such breach; provided that Parent's or
its Affiliate's breach of any of their covenants or agreements contained in
Section 8.5 that was the basis of the Company's termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.1(k) did not arise from the Company's material
breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in Section 8.5.



Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and have no effect, and the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 5.25, Section
6.15, Section 6.16, the last sentence of Section 8.1, Section 8.6(a) (other
than the last sentence thereof), Section 8.11(f), this Section 10.2, Section
10.3, Article I and Article XI and the Guaranty, and, subject to Section 10.3,
there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto; provided,
however, that, subject to Section 10.3(b) and Section 10.3(c), nothing herein
shall relieve any party hereto from any Losses (which the parties acknowledge
and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of Expenses, and may include
the benefit of the bargain lost by a party's equityholders (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to such
stockholders under this Agreement, lost combination opportunities and the time
value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such
party) arising out of its Willful Breach of, or fraud in connection with, any
provision of this Agreement; provided, however, that, under no circumstances
will the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for monetary
damages or other monetary remedies (including payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, any Losses or other amounts payable pursuant to this sentence
or any other damages related to this Agreement) in connection with this
Agreement, the agreements contemplated hereby or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby be greater than the Parent Termination Fee, and in no event
shall any Company Related Party seek or obtain, nor shall it permit any of its
Representatives or any other Person on its or their behalf to seek or obtain,
any monetary recovery or monetary award or any monetary damages of any kind
against Parent and Merger Sub in excess of the Parent Termination Fee. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 10.2 shall
be deemed to affect their right to specific performance in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in Section 11.11. In addition to the foregoing,
no termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations
shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, for
purposes of this Section 10.2 and the fourth sentence of Section 10.3(c),
"Parent Termination Fee" shall be deemed to refer to Three Hundred and Thirty-
Five Million Dollars ($335,000,000.00). 

Section 10.3 Fees and Expenses.



(a) In the event that:

(i)this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or
(B) the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(h); or

(ii)(A) prior to the date of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, an Alternative
Transaction Proposal shall have been publicly made to the Company or directly
to its stockholders generally and not publicly withdrawn at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders' Meeting, (B) this Agreement
is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(b) (other than
if failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before the Outside Date is
due solely to the failure of the Debt Financing to be funded on the date the
Closing should have occurred under Section 2.2 and other than if this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(b) (in
circumstances in which the Company could terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(f), Section 10.1(i) or Section 10.1(k)), by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 10.1(d) or by Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(g) and (C)
within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated by any
Alternative Transaction Proposal; provided, that references to "twenty percent
(20%)" in the definition of Alternative Transaction Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "fifty percent (50%)";

then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee. Any fee due
under this Section 10.3(a) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account provided in writing by Parent to the Company (x)
in the case of termination pursuant to clause (i)(A) above, not later than the
second (2nd) Business Day following such termination, (y) in the case of
termination pursuant to clause (i)(B) above, concurrently with or prior to
(and as a condition to) such termination or (z) in the case of termination
pursuant to clause (ii) above, not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following the applicable event referred to in clause (ii)(C) above. The
"Company Termination Fee" means One Hundred and Forty-Two Million Dollars
($142,000,000.00); provided, however, that, if the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(h) to enter into an Alternative Transaction
Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal with any Exempted Person prior to
the Cut Off Time, then the Company Termination Fee means Sixty-Five Million
Dollars ($65,000,000.00).

(b) In the event that this Agreement is (w) terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 10.1(k), (x) terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(f)
or Section 10.1(i), (y) terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(b) (in
circumstances in which the Company could terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(f), Section 10.1(i) or Section 10.1(k)) or (z) terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(j) (other than for a Rating Event arising
primarily from a breach of Section 8.6(b) by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary), then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the
Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account provided in writing by the Company to Parent not later than the second
(2nd) Business Day 

following such termination. The "Parent Termination Fee" means an amount equal
to Three Hundred and Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($335,000,000.00); provided,
however, that, if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(j)
(other than (x) for a Rating Event arising primarily from a breach of Section
8.6(b) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or arising from a breach of
Section 8.6(b) by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates or (y) in
circumstances in which the Company could terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(f), Section 10.1(i) or Section 10.1(k)), then the Parent
Termination Fee means One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000.00).



(c) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 10.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the
Company would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Accordingly, in the event that the Company shall
fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due or Parent shall fail to pay
the Parent Termination Fee when due, and in order to obtain such payment, the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, commences a suit which results in a
judgment against such other party for such fee, then the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, shall pay to the other party such other party's Expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of enforcement) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts owed at the
prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in The Wall Street
Journal, plus two percent (2%) per annum from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until the date actually received by such party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 11.11, the Company's right to receive payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.3(b) shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any of their
respective, direct or indirect, former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, Representatives or assignees (collectively, the "Company
Related Parties") against Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor, Volt, the Identified
Sponsor Investors, any other potential source of Equity Financing, the Debt
Financing Sources or any of their respective, direct or indirect, former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, Representatives
or assignees (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for all Losses
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Equity Financing
Commitments, the Debt Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated
thereby (except that Parent shall also be obligated to the Company under the
third sentence of this Section 10.3(c) and Guarantor shall also be obligated
pursuant to the 

terms and conditions of the Guaranty). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to Section 11.11, Parent's
right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub and the other Parent
Related Parties against the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Related Parties for all Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby (except in the case of Willful Breach or fraud (other than in
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section
10.3(a)(ii) as a result of such breach), subject to Section 10.2, and except
that the Company shall also be obligated to Parent and Merger Sub under the
third sentence of this Section 10.3(c)). For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company Related Parties will not have any rights or claims, and will not seek
any rights or claims, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in connection
with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, and the Debt Financing Sources
shall not have any liability or obligation to the Company Related Parties in
connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall affect
the rights of the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates or any Company
Related Parties (determined after giving effect to the Merger) against the
Debt Financing Sources or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to
the Debt Financing upon consummation of, or following, the Merger.



(d) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of
action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, may only be made against the entities that
are expressly identified as parties hereto and no Parent Related Party (other
than Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Guaranty or Equity Financing
Commitments) or Company Related Party shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without
limiting the rights of any party against the other parties hereto, in no event
shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any Parent Related Party (other than any
payment from Guarantor to the extent set forth in the Guaranty) or any Company
Related Party, as the case may be.

Section 11.3 Interpretation. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. The headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The specification of any
dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in Article V or
Article VI is not intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, are or are not material for purposes of this Agreement, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or
controversy between or among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires a Company Subsidiary to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Company Subsidiary to take such action and, after
the Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires
Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.



Section 11.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits, Schedules and other documents and instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings (other than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
which is hereby incorporated by reference herein), both written and oral,
among the parties or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
including any transaction between or among the parties. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise; provided that each of Parent
or Merger Sub may transfer or assign all or any other portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Company to (i) any one or more of its Affiliates so long as Parent or Merger
Sub, as applicable, remains jointly and severally obligated to satisfy all of
its obligations under the terms of this Agreement and (ii) any one or more of
its financing sources to the extent necessary for purposes of creating a
security 

interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of such
financing. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment in
violation of the terms of this Section 11.4 shall be null and void ab initio.



Section 11.5 Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.



(a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall be
interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.



(b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Courts") for
any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), (ii) waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and (iii) agrees not to
plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has
been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
(A) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in
the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of
Delaware as such party's agent for acceptance of legal process and (B) service
of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to clauses (A)
or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence shall have the same legal force
and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of
Delaware.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any litigation
arising out of or related to the Debt Financing (including any litigation
involving any Debt Financing Source) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts
of law principles thereof.



(d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT FINANCING) IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT 

SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.5.

Section 11.6 Expenses. Except as expressly set forth herein (including Section
8.5 and Section 10.2), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses. As used in this
Agreement, "Expenses" includes all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, financial
advisors, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates)
incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation,
printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of
stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 11.7 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 11.8 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein (or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto) and (c) subject to the requirements of
Applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall act as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Section 11.7 (Amendment), this Section 11.8 (Waiver), Section
10.3(c) and (d) (Fees and Expenses), Section 11.5 (Governing Law and Venue;
Waiver of Jury Trial) and the last sentence of Section 11.10 (Parties in
Interest) (collectively, the "DFS Provisions") may not be amended, waived or
otherwise modified without the consent of the Debt Financing Sources that are
party to the Debt Financing Commitments, and no other amendment, waiver or
other modification to any other provision of this Agreement that has the
substantive effect of amending, waiving or modifying any of the DFS Provisions
in a manner materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources shall be
effective without the consent of the Debt Financing Sources that are party to
the Debt Financing Commitments.



Section 11.9 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when 

each party shall have received counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by
facsimile, e-mail of a .pdf attachment or otherwise) by all of the other
parties.



Section 11.10 Severability; Validity; Parties in Interest. If any provision of
this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any rule of law or public policy,
the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, and, to such end, the
provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. Except (a) as
provided in Section 8.7(e), (b) following the Effective Time, for the
provisions of Article IV and (c) for the right of the Company, on behalf of
its stockholders, to pursue damages in the event of Parent's or Merger Sub's
breach of this Agreement or fraud, which right is hereby acknowledged and
agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt Financing Source shall be
an express third-party beneficiary with respect to the DFS Provisions.



Section 11.11 Enforcement of Agreement. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached or
the Merger was not consummated, and that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
(on behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement
provided in Section 11.10) shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties' obligations to consummate the Merger
and Parent's obligation to pay, and the right of the stockholders of the
Company to receive, the Merger Consideration) in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything herein, or in the Debt Financing Commitments, the Equity Financing
Commitments or the Guaranty, to the contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Closing in accordance with Article II only if (a) the
conditions in Section 9.1 and Section 9.3 have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing (and which are, at the time that the Company seeks specific
performance in accordance with this Section 11.11, 

capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time)), or the
failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by
Parent or Merger Sub of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, (b) the Closing should
have occurred at such time pursuant to Section 2.2, (c) the financing provided
for by the Bridge Financing Commitment (or, the Alternative Financing, as the
case may be) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, (d) either (i) (A) approval by the
requisite Revolving Lenders of the Revolver Amendment shall have been received
and (B) the Revolver Amendment shall have been executed and delivered by all
parties thereto and shall be fully effective subject solely to the concurrent
closing of the Merger and the payment of fees under the Revolver Amendment or
(ii) the definitive documentation in respect of the Revolver Financing shall
have been executed and delivered by all parties thereto and shall be fully
effective subject solely to the concurrent closing of the Merger and the
payment of fees under such Revolver Financing, and (e) the Company has
provided written confirmation to Parent that, if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and the Bridge Financing are funded, it will
take such actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur in
accordance with Article II. While Parent or the Company may pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with this Section 11.11 and
payment of either the Parent Termination Fee under Section 10.3(b) or the
Company Termination Fee under Section 10.3(a), as applicable, or Losses
pursuant to Section 10.2, in no event shall (i) the Company be entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance requiring consummation of the
Merger and either the Parent Termination Fee under Section 10.3(b) together
with any interest payable thereon in accordance with Section 10.3(c) or Losses
pursuant to Section 10.2 and (ii) Parent be entitled to receive both a grant
of specific performance requiring consummation of the Merger and the Company
Termination Fee under Section 10.3(a) together with any interest payable
thereon in accordance with Section 10.3(c) or Losses pursuant to Section 10.2.

matters put to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. 

4.Preemptive Rights. The holders of shares of the Corporation of any class,
