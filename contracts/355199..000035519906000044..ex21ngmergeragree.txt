company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "PAYING AGENT") to act
as agent for the payment of the Merger  Consideration in respect of Certificates
upon  surrender of such  Certificates  (or effective  affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof)  in  accordance  with  this  Article  III from  time to time  after the
Effective Time. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause
to be  deposited,  with  the  Paying  Agent  cash in  amounts  and at the  times
necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b)
upon surrender of such  Certificates  (such cash being herein referred to as the
"PAYMENT  FUND").  The Paying  Agent will invest the Payment Fund as directed by
Parent.

(b) PAYMENT PROCEDURES. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving  Corporation  will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Shares  (other  than  Excluded  Shares)  a letter  of  transmittal  in
customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties specifying that delivery will
be effected,  and risk of loss and title to  Certificates  will pass,  only upon
proper  delivery  of  Certificates  (or  effective  affidavits  of  loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the  Certificates  (or  effective  affidavits  of loss in  lieu  thereof)  in
exchange  for  the  Merger  Consideration.   Upon  the  proper  surrender  of  a
Certificate  (or  effective  affidavit  of loss in lieu  thereof)  to the Paying
Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,  duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash
in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax  withholdings)  that such
holder  has  the  right  to  receive  pursuant  to  this  Article  III,  and the
Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.  In the
event of a  transfer  of  ownership  of  Shares  that is not  registered  in the
transfer  records  of the  Company,  cash to be paid upon due  surrender  of the
Certificate  may be  paid  to  such a  transferee  if the  Certificate  formerly
representing  such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,  accompanied  by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c)  WITHHOLDING  TAXES.  Parent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from amounts  otherwise  payable  pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares or holder of Stock Options any amounts  required to be deducted
and  withheld  with  respect to such  payments  under the Code and the rules and
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. Any amounts so deducted  and  withheld  will be treated for all
purposes  of this  Agreement  as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or
holders of Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

                                       12
<PAGE>

(d) NO FURTHER  TRANSFERS.  After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers
on the stock  transfer  books of the  Company  of Shares  that were  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Shares
that  occurred  prior to the  Effective  Time.  If,  after the  Effective  Time,
Certificates  are  presented to the Paying  Agent,  they will be  cancelled  and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III.

(e)  TERMINATION  OF PAYMENT FUND.  Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
undistributed  to the holders of the  Certificates 12 months after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent, on demand, and any holder of a Certificate who
has not theretofore  complied with this Article III will thereafter look only to
Parent  for   payment   of  his  or  her   claims   for  Merger   Consideration.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  none of Parent,  MergerCo,  the  Company,  the
Surviving  Corporation,  the Paying  Agent or any other Person will be liable to
any  former  holder of Shares  for any  amount  delivered  to a public  official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(f) LOST,  STOLEN OR DESTROYED  CERTIFICATES.  In the event any  Certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person  claiming such  Certificate  to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving  Corporation,  the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary  amount and upon such terms as Parent may  determine  are necessary as
indemnity  against  any claim that may be made  against it with  respect to such
Certificate,  the Paying Agent will issue in exchange  for such lost,  stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) DISSENTING SHARES.  Parent and Company do not believe that the provisions of
Article 15 of the VSCA will be applicable to the Merger.  However,  in the event
such Article  becomes  applicable,  then  notwithstanding  any provision of this
Agreement  to the  contrary,  any Shares  outstanding  immediately  prior to the
Effective Time that are held by a shareholder (a "DISSENTING  SHAREHOLDER")  who
has neither  voted in favor of the  adoption  of this  Agreement  nor  consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded  properly in writing  appraisal for such
Shares and  otherwise  properly  perfected  and not withdrawn or lost his or her
rights (the "DISSENTING  SHARES") in accordance with Article 15 of the VSCA will
not  be  converted  into,  or  represent  the  right  to  receive,   the  Merger
Consideration.  Such Dissenting Shareholders will be entitled to receive payment
of the appraised value of Dissenting  Shares held by them in accordance with the
provisions of Article 15 of the VSCA,  except that all Dissenting Shares held by
shareholders  who have failed to perfect or who  effectively  have  withdrawn or
lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting  Shares pursuant to Article 15
of the VSCA will thereupon be deemed to have been converted  into, and represent
the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Article
III and will no longer  be  Excluded  Shares.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the
contrary  contained  in this  Section  3.2(g),  if the  Merger is  rescinded  or
abandoned,  then the right of any  shareholder to be paid the fair value of such
shareholder's  Dissenting  Shares pursuant to Article 15 of the VSCA will cease.
The  Company  will give  MergerCo  prompt  notice  of any  written  demands  for
appraisal,  attempted  withdrawals  of such demands,  and any other

                                       13
<PAGE>

instruments  served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company  relating
to  shareholders'  rights of  appraisal.  The  Company  will give  MergerCo  the
opportunity to participate in and direct all  negotiations  and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal to the extent  permitted by applicable Law. The
Company will not,  except with the prior  written  consent of MergerCo or unless
and to the extent required to do so under  applicable Law, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting  Shares,  offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such
demands.

Section  3.3.......ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT DILUTION. In the event that, after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective  Time, the Company  changes the number of
Shares,  or securities  convertible  or  exchangeable  into or  exercisable  for
Shares,  issued and  outstanding  prior to the  Effective  Time as a result of a
reclassification,  stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend
or  distribution,   recapitalization,  merger,  subdivision,  issuer  tender  or
exchange offer, or other similar  transaction,  the Merger Consideration will be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change;  PROVIDED,  that nothing herein shall
be  construed  to permit  the  Company to take any  action  with  respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section  3.4.......TREATMENT  OF STOCK  OPTIONS.  (a) Each  option  to  purchase
Shares, other than rights to acquire Shares pursuant to the ESPP, (collectively,
the  "STOCK  OPTIONS")  outstanding  immediately  prior  to the  Effective  Time
pursuant  to  the  Company   Benefit  Plans  (whether  or  not  then  vested  or
exercisable)  will at the  Effective  Time be  cancelled  and the holder of such
Stock Option will,  in full  settlement of such Stock Option and in exchange for
the surrender to the Company of any  certificate  or other  document  evidencing
such Stock Option, receive from the Company an amount (subject to any applicable
withholding  tax) in cash,  without  interest,  equal to the  product of (x) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of
such Stock Option  multiplied by (y) the number of Shares  subject to such Stock
Option  (with the  aggregate  amount of such  payment  rounded up to the nearest
whole cent).  All Stock Options shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the
holders of Stock  Options  will have no  further  rights in respect of any Stock
Options from and after the Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Effective  Time,  the Company will adopt such  resolutions  and
will take such other  actions as shall be  required  to  effectuate  the actions
contemplated by this Section 3.4, without paying any  consideration or incurring
any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving  Corporation.
Parent and the  Company  will  cooperate  with each other in  establishing  such
procedures as may be necessary to provide for the timely  payment of the amounts
payable  pursuant to Section 3.4(a) and for the timely and accurate  calculation
of, and payment to the applicable  taxing  authority of, all amounts required to
be withheld in respect of such amounts.

Section  3.5.......TREATMENT  OF ESPP. Prior to the date hereof,  the Company or
the  administrator  of the  Company's  2004  Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan (the
"ESPP") has taken all such action (and provided Parent evidence  thereof) as may
be necessary  under the ESPP (a) to provide that in connection with the Closing,
the then effective  Purchase Interval (as defined in the ESPP) will be shortened
so that it ends  on,  and a New  Purchase

                                       14
<PAGE>

Date (as defined in the ESPP) is established as of, a date that is no later than
5 Business Days prior to the Effective Time, (b) to provide that participants in
the ESPP shall purchase  Shares on such New Purchase Date,  unless prior to such
date the  participant  has withdrawn  from the Purchase  Interval (in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP), (c) to terminate the ESPP as of the Effective Time,
and (d) to prohibit  (i) any  increase in the rate of payroll  deductions  being
made  by  participants  to  the  ESPP,  (ii)  any  further  direct  payments  by
participants  thereunder  that were not  authorized  as of the date hereof,  and
(iii) the acceptance of any new participants into the ESPP.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  The Company  hereby  represents  and warrants to Parent and to
MergerCo as follows,  except as set forth (i) in the applicable  sections (or by
internal  cross-reference)  of the  letter  (the  "COMPANY  DISCLOSURE  LETTER")
delivered  by the  Company to Parent  concurrently  with the  execution  of this
Agreement (provided that the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure
Letter as an exception to a  representation  or warranty  shall not be deemed an
admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event
or circumstance or that such item has or would have a Company  Material  Adverse
Effect) or (ii) in the Company's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended  December 31, 2005 or any Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report
on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC after January 1, 2006 and prior to
October 15, 2006  (collectively,  the "2005 SEC DOCUMENTS")  (other than (A) any
risk factor disclosure,  including disclosures contained in the "Forward Looking
Statements"  and "Risk  Factors"  sections of the 2005 SEC Documents and (B) any
documents  filed as exhibits to such 2005 SEC  Documents  to the extent that the
information  is only set  forth in such  exhibits);  provided  however  that the
foregoing  exception in clause (ii) shall not apply to the  representations  and
warranties contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 and 4.6.

Section  4.1.......ORGANIZATION;  POWER; QUALIFICATION.  The Company and each of
its  Subsidiaries  is a corporation,  limited  liability  company or other legal
entity duly organized,  validly  existing and in good standing under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of  organization.  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
the requisite  corporate or  partnership  power and authority to own,  lease and
operate its assets and to carry on its  business as now  conducted.  Each of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries  is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign  corporation,  limited liability company or other legal entity and is in
good  standing  in each  jurisdiction  where the  character  of the  assets  and
properties  owned,  leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such  qualification  or license  necessary,  except  where the  failure to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing does not have and would not reasonably
be  expected  to have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a Company  Material
Adverse  Effect.  Neither the Company nor any  Subsidiary  nor, to the Company's
Knowledge,  any Company Joint Venture,  is in violation of its organizational or
governing  documents,  except for such violations that do not have and would not
reasonably  be expected to have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.2.......CORPORATE  AUTHORIZATION;  ENFORCEABILITY. (a) The Company has
all  requisite  corporate  power and  authority to enter into and to perform its
obligations  under this Agreement and,  subject to approval of this Agreement by
the Requisite Company Vote, to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement.  The Board of  Directors  of the Company  (the  "COMPANY  BOARD") has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby,  including the Merger, are advisable,  fair to and in the best interests
of the Company and its  shareholders,  (ii) approved and adopted this  Agreement
and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  including  the  Merger,  and (iii)
resolved  to  recommend   approval  of  this  Agreement  and  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby,  including the Merger,  by the shareholders of the Company
((i), (ii), and (iii)  collectively,  the "COMPANY BOARD  RECOMMENDATION"),  and
directed that such matter be submitted for  consideration of the shareholders of
the Company at the Company  Shareholders  Meeting.  The execution,  delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject
to the Requisite Company Vote.

(b) This  Agreement  has been duly  executed  and  delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due  authorization,  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement by
Parent and MergerCo,  constitutes a valid and binding  agreement of the Company,

Section 4.3.......CAPITALIZATION;  OPTIONS. (a) The Company's authorized capital

of Preferred Stock (the "PREFERRED  STOCK"),  of which 2,500 shares of Preferred
Stock are designated as Class A Preferred  Stock and 500,000 shares of Preferred
Stock are designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. As of the close of
business on October  31, 2006 (the  "MEASUREMENT  DATE"),  21,780,467  shares of
Common  Stock were  issued and  outstanding.  No shares of  Preferred  Stock are
issued or  outstanding.  As of the  Measurement  Date, no Shares are held in the

Agreement,  other than in connection with the issuance of Shares pursuant to the
exercise of Stock Options outstanding as of the Measurement Date, there has been
no change in the number of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or
the number of  outstanding  Stock Options.  As of the  Measurement  Date,  Stock
Options to purchase  2,653,390 shares of Common Stock were  outstanding,  with a
weighted  average  exercise  price of $9.26  per  share.  Section  4.3(a) of the
Company  Disclosure  Letter sets forth a complete  and correct list of all Stock
Options that are outstanding as of the  Measurement  Date, the exercise price of
each such Stock Option, and with respect to the Persons specified  thereon,  the
number  of Stock  Options  held by each  such  Person  and the  exercise  prices
thereof. Except as set forth in this Section 4.3, there are no shares of capital
stock  or  securities  or  other  rights  convertible  or  exchangeable  into or
exercisable  for shares of capital  stock of the Company or such  securities  or
other rights  (which term,  for  purposes of this  Agreement,  will be deemed to
include "phantom" stock,  stock  appreciation  rights, or other commitments that
provide any right to receive  value or benefits  similar to such capital  stock,
securities or other rights). Since the Measurement Date through the date of this
Agreement,  there have been

                                       16
<PAGE>

no issuances of any  securities of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  that
would  have  been in  breach  of  Section  6.1 if made  after  the  date of this
Agreement.

(b) All outstanding Shares are duly authorized,  validly issued,  fully paid and
non-assessable and are not subject to any pre-emptive rights.

(c) There are no  outstanding  contractual  obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (i) to issue,  sell, or otherwise transfer to any Person, or to
repurchase,  redeem or otherwise acquire from any Person, any Shares,  Preferred
Stock,  capital stock of any  Subsidiary of the Company,  or securities or other
rights  convertible or  exchangeable  into or exercisable  for shares of capital
stock of the  Company or any  Subsidiary  of the Company or such  securities  or
other  rights  or (ii) to  provide  any funds to or make any  investment  in any
Subsidiary of the Company that is not wholly owned by the Company.

(d) Other than the issuance of Shares upon  exercise of Stock  Options and other
than previously announced regular quarterly dividends, since January 1, 2006 and
through the date of this  Agreement,  the  Company has not  declared or paid any
dividend or distribution in respect of any of the Company's securities.

(e) Each  Company  Benefit Plan  providing  for the grant of Shares or of awards
denominated in, or otherwise  measured by reference to, Shares (each, a "COMPANY
STOCK AWARD PLAN") is set forth (and  identified  as a Company Stock Award Plan)
in Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company has provided to
Parent  correct and  complete  copies of all  Company  Stock Award Plans and all
forms of options  and other  stock-based  awards  (including  award  agreements)
issued under such Company Stock Award Plans.

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
entered  into  any  commitment,   arrangement  or  agreement,  or  is  otherwise
obligated,  to contribute capital, loan money or otherwise provide funds or make
additional   investments  in  any  Person  other  than  any  such   commitments,
arrangements,  or agreements in the ordinary course of business  consistent with
past practice, and other than pursuant to Material Contracts.

(g) The maximum number of Shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the ESPP is
1,000,000.  Not more than 10,000  Shares  will be issuable  pursuant to the ESPP
with  respect to the current  Purchase  Interval  which is  scheduled  to end on
December 31, 2006.  With respect to any subsequent  Purchase  Interval and until
the Effective Time, (i) not more than 10,000 Shares will be issuable pursuant to
the  ESPP  during  such  Purchase  Interval  and (ii) the  total  amount  of all
contributions  by participants to their respective  participant  accounts during
any 30-day  period  during such  Purchase  Interval  shall not exceed the dollar
amount  that,  when  applied  to the  purchase  of Shares  under the ESPP on the
Purchase Date (as defined in the ESPP) or New Purchase Date with respect to such
Purchase Interval, would result in the purchase of a total of 3,333 Shares under
the ESPP.

Section  4.4.......SUBSIDIARIES  AND COMPANY JOINT VENTURES.  Section 4.4 of the

Company's  Subsidiaries and all Company Joint Ventures.  All equity interests of
the Company's Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures held by the Company or
any other Subsidiary are validly issued,  fully paid and non-assessable and were
not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar  rights,  purchase  option,
call or right of first refusal or similar rights.  All such equity interests are
free and clear of any Liens or any other  limitations  or  restrictions  on such
equity interests  (including any limitation or restriction on the right to vote,
pledge or sell or  otherwise  dispose of such equity  interests)  other than any
restrictions  contained in the Joint Venture  Agreements  related  thereto.  The
Company has made available to Parent  complete and correct copies of the Company

<PAGE>

and in full force and effect does not have, and would not reasonably be expected
to have,  individually or in the aggregate,  a Company  Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects  performed
all material  obligations  required to be  performed  by it under each  Material

material default on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such Material Contract.

(c) With respect to each Contract between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Governmental  Entity and each outstanding bid,  quotation or proposal by
the  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  (each,  a "BID")  that if  accepted or
awarded could lead to a Contract  between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and  any   Governmental   Entity,   including   any  Contract  for  the  use  of
government-owned  facilities  (each such Contract or Bid, a "COMPANY  GOVERNMENT
CONTRACT"), and each Contract between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any prime contractor or upper-tier  subcontractor relating to a Contract between

purposes of this clause (i), the terms Company  Government  Contract and Company
Government Subcontract shall not include any Bids;

(ii) the Company and its  Subsidiaries  have  complied in all material  respects
with all terms and  conditions  of such Company  Government  Contract or Company

clause,  provision or requirement pertaining to such Company Government Contract
or Company  Government  Subcontract,  and all facts set forth or acknowledged by

Company,  current, accurate and complete in all material respects on the date of
submission;

(vi) in the last three  years,  neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries,  nor any of the respective

Company,  threatened,  "whistleblower"  or "qui tam" lawsuit,  or the subject of
investigation  by the  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  with  respect to any
alleged act or  omission  arising  under or  relating to any Company  Government
Contract or Company Government Subcontract.

(e) There exist (i) no outstanding material claims against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries,  either by any Governmental Entity or by any prime contractor,
subcontractor,  vendor or other Person, arising under or relating to any Company

nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has received any material adverse past performance
evaluations  or ratings in  connection  with any  Company  Government  Contract,
Company  Government  Subcontract or other  Contract with a  Governmental  Entity
within the past three years. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
(i) any  interest in any pending or  potential  claim  against any  Governmental

debarment or suspension,  from  participation in the award of Contracts with the
United States  government or any other  Governmental  Entity (excluding for this
purpose  ineligibility to bid on certain  contracts due to generally  applicable
bidding requirements).  To the Knowledge of the Company, there exist no facts or
circumstances   that  are  reasonably  likely  to  warrant  the  institution  of
suspension  or debarment  proceedings  or the finding of  non-responsibility  or
ineligibility  on the part of the  Company,  any of its  Subsidiaries  or any of
their respective directors, officers or employees.

(g) The Company and its  Subsidiaries  have not  submitted  to any  Governmental

pricing  data,  certification,   bid,  proposal,  report,  claim  or  any  other
information  relating  to a  Company  Government  Contract,  Company  Government
Subcontract, or Bid, in such circumstances which could give rise to a reasonable
belief that such submission was in violation of applicable Law.

task order and description, all work or future business opportunities from which
the Company, its Affiliates, Subsidiaries or other related Person, are currently

Company,   its  Affiliates  or  Subsidiaries  in  connection  with  any  Company
Government Contract.

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, all indirect and general and administrative
expense rates have been and are being billed  consistent  with Defense  Contract
Audit Agency approved rates or provisional rates.

(j) During the last five years,  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has made any  voluntary  disclosure in writing to any  Governmental  Entity with
respect to any material alleged  irregularity,  misstatement or omission arising
under  or  relating  to  a  Company  Government  Contract,   Company  Government
Subcontract, or Bid, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contemplating
making any such voluntary disclosure.

(k) Except as set forth in  Section  4.12(k) of the  Company  Disclosure  Letter
(setting forth the contracting party, name of contract, date of contract,  total
value of contract,  and value of any  unexercised  options),  the Company has no
Company  Government  Contracts  or  Company  Government  Subcontracts  that were
awarded as small business set aside contracts.

Section  4.13......EMPLOYEE  COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS;  ERISA. (a) Section
4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of
each Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan that is a plan that has two
or more contributing  sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control
(within the meaning of Section  4063 of ERISA) (a "MULTIPLE  EMPLOYER  PLAN") is
denoted as such on Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. No business
or entity is a member of the  Company's  "controlled  group" or is under "common
control"  with the  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  (within  the meaning of
Section 414 of the Code) other than the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) With respect to each Company  Benefit Plan, if  applicable,  the Company has
provided  to  Parent  correct  and  complete  copies  of (i) all plan  texts and
agreements and related trust  agreements (or other funding  vehicles);  (ii) the
most recent  summary  plan  descriptions  and material  employee  communications
concerning  the extent of the benefits  provided  under a Company  Benefit Plan;
(iii) the three most recent annual reports  (including all schedules);  (iv) the
three most recent annual audited financial  statements and opinions;  (v) if the
plan is intended to qualify  under Section  401(a) of the Code,  the most recent
determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"); and
(vi) all material  communications with any domestic Governmental Entity given or
received since January 1, 2004.  There is no present  intention that any Company
Benefit  Plan be  materially  amended,  suspended  or  terminated,  or otherwise
modified to adversely  change  benefits (or the level thereof) under any Company
Benefit Plan at any time within the twelve months immediately following the date
of this Agreement.

(c)  Since  January  1,  2006,  there  has not been any  amendment  or change in
interpretation relating to any Company Benefit Plan which would, individually or
in the aggregate,  materially  increase the aggregate cost to the Company of all
Company Benefit Plans. The Company and its  Subsidiaries  have complied with all
obligations  with respect to employee  benefits  matters  required in connection
with the Company's acquisition of Adaptive Optics Associates, Inc.

(d) No Company  Benefit  Plan is subject to Title IV or Section  302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has, at any time during the last six years,  contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA) (a  "MULTIEMPLOYER  PLAN") or Multiple Employer Plan other than a plan
listed on Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.  Neither the Company
nor any of its  Subsidiaries  would be reasonably  expected to be liable for any
liability  to  a  Multiemployer  Plan  as a  result  of a  complete  or  partial
withdrawal from such

                                       26
<PAGE>

Multiemployer  Plan (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title
IV of ERISA) (a "WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY") that has not been satisfied in full.

(e) Each Company  Benefit Plan that requires  registration  with a  Governmental
Entity has been  properly  registered,  except  where any  failure to  register,
either  individually  or in the  aggregate,  would not reasonably be expected to
result in a material  liability to the Company.  Each Company Benefit Plan which
is  intended  to  qualify  under  Section  401(a) of the Code has been  issued a
favorable  determination  letter by the IRS with respect to such  qualification,
its related trust has been  determined to be exempt from taxation  under Section
501(a)  of  the  Code  and  no  event  has  occurred  since  the  date  of  such
qualification  or  exemption  that would  reasonably  be expected to  materially
adversely affect such qualification or exemption.  Each Company Benefit Plan has
been established and administered in material compliance with its terms and with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws. No event
has occurred and no condition exists that would subject the Company by reason of
its affiliation  with any current or former member of its "controlled  group" or
any business or entity that is under "common control" with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (in each case within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code) to
any material (i) Tax, penalty,  fine, (ii) Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) or
(iii) other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws.

(f) There are no (i) Company  Benefit  Plans under which  welfare  benefits  are
provided to past or present employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries beyond
their retirement or other  termination of service,  other than coverage mandated
by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Recommendation Act of 1985 ("COBRA"), Section
4980B of the Code,  Title I of ERISA or any  similar  state  group  health  plan
continuation  Laws,  the cost of which is fully paid by such  employees or their
dependents;  or (ii) unfunded  Company Benefit Plan  obligations with respect to
any past or present  employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  that are not
fairly  reflected  by  reserves  shown on the most recent  financial  statements
contained  in the Company SEC  Documents,  except as does not have and would not
reasonably  be expected to have,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated  hereby will (either alone or in combination with
another event) (i) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the amount of
any  compensation  or benefits  due,  to any  current or former  employee of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries  or with respect to any Company Benefit Plan; (ii)
increase any benefits  otherwise  payable under any Company Benefit Plan;  (iii)
result  in the  acceleration  of the  time of  payment  or  vesting  of any such
compensation or benefits;  (iv) result in a non-exempt "prohibited  transaction"
within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or section  4975 of the Code;  or (v)
result in the payment of any amount that would,  individually  or in combination
with any other such  payment,  reasonably  be expected to  constitute an "excess
parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

                                       27

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Benefit Plan,
nor to the  Knowledge  of the Company any  "disqualified  person" (as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code) or "party in interest" (as defined in Section 3(18) of
ERISA), has engaged in any non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) which,  individually  or in
the  aggregate,  has resulted or would  reasonably  be expected to result in any
material  liability to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries.  With respect to
any Company  Benefit Plan, (i) no Legal Actions  (including  any  administrative
investigation,  audit or other  proceeding by the Department of Labor or the IRS
but other than routine  claims for benefits in the ordinary  course) are pending
or, to the  Knowledge of the Company,  threatened,  and (ii) to the Knowledge of
the  Company,  no  events  or  conditions  have  occurred  or exist  that  would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Legal Actions.

(i)  Except as does not have and  would  not  reasonably  be  expected  to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all Company
Benefit  Plans  subject  to the Laws of any  jurisdiction  outside of the United
States (i) have been maintained in accordance with all applicable  requirements,
(ii) if they are  intended  to  qualify  for  special  tax  treatment,  meet all
requirements  for such  treatment,  and (iii) if they are  intended to be funded
and/or  book-reserved,  are fully funded and/or book reserved,  as  appropriate,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

(j) Each  "nonqualified  deferred  compensation  plan" (as  defined  in  Section
409A(d)(1)  of the  Code)  of the  Company  has  been  operated  in  good  faith

Section  6.2.......CERTAIN  LIMITATIONS.  Nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended  to give to Parent  or  MergerCo,  directly  or  indirectly,  rights to
control or direct the  operations of the Company  prior to the  Effective  Time.
Prior to the Effective  Time, the Company shall  exercise,  consistent  with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement,  complete control and supervision of its
and its  Subsidiaries'  operations.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of Section
6.1(i),  if Parent's  consent is required to be sought with  respect to a matter
contemplated  by Section 6.1,  then, (A) if the Company  believes  (based on the
advice of counsel) that providing  Parent with  disclosure  with respect to such
matter would violate  applicable Law, or obtaining Parent's consent with respect
to such matter would violate  applicable Law, then Company's outside counsel and
Parent's  outside counsel shall review the subject matter and jointly  determine
whether such disclosure may be made to Parent without violating  applicable Law,
or  obtaining  Parent's  consent on such  matter may be done  without  violating
applicable Law, and (B) (1) if such counsel agree that such disclosure to Parent
would violate applicable Law, or obtaining Parent's consent on such matter would
violate  applicable  Law,  then such matter shall not be disclosed to Parent and
the Company shall not need to obtain Parent's consent to such matter,  or (2) if
such counsel do not agree that disclosure of such matter to Parent would violate
applicable  Law or  obtaining  Parent's  consent on such  matter  would  violate
applicable  Law (the counsel that is advising that such  disclosure or obtaining
of such consent would violate  applicable  Law being referred to as the "Vetoing
Counsel"),  then, as long as Parent's counsel was not the Vetoing Counsel,  such
matter shall be disclosed to Parent and  Parent's  consent  shall be  requested,
provided  that Parent  shall not withhold its consent to such matter if Parent's
outside  counsel  advises  Parent that  withholding  its consent  would  violate
applicable Law.

Section  6.3.......ACCESS  TO  INFORMATION;   CONFIDENTIALITY.  (a)  Subject  to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and except as otherwise
agreed to by the parties  hereto,  the Company  will  provide and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective  Representatives to provide Parent and
its  Representatives,  during normal business hours and upon reasonable  advance
notice  (i)  such  access  to  the  officers,   management  employees,  offices,
properties,  books and records of the Company and such  Subsidiaries (so long as
such access does not unreasonably  interfere with the operations of the Company)
as Parent  reasonably may request and (ii) all documents that Parent  reasonably
may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Representatives shall
not have access to any books,  records and other  information  the disclosure of
which  would,  in the  Company's  good faith  opinion,  (x)  violate  any of its
obligations  with

                                       41
<PAGE>

respect to confidentiality  to any third party,  PROVIDED the Company shall have
used  reasonable  efforts  to obtain the  consent  of such  third  party to such
inspection  or  disclosure  without  requiring the Company to pay more than a DE
MINIMIS  amount or waive any rights to obtain  such  consent;  (y) result in the
loss of attorney-client  privilege;  or (z) violate  applicable Laws;  PROVIDED,
that this  Section  6.3(a) shall not obligate the Company to devote any material
resources to create any  information  that does not already exist at the time of
such  request  (other than to convert  existing  information  from one medium to
another,  such as  providing  a  printout  of  information  that is  sorted in a
computer database).

(b) No investigation  by any of the parties or their respective  Representatives
shall affect the  representations,  warranties,  covenants or  agreements of the
other parties set forth herein.

Section 6.4.......NO SOLICITATION. (a) From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, except as specifically  permitted in Section 6.4(d), the Company
agrees that  neither it nor any of its  Subsidiaries  nor any of the officers or
directors of it or its  Subsidiaries  shall, and that it shall cause its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

(i)  initiate,  solicit or knowingly  encourage  (including  by way of providing
information)  or knowingly  facilitate any  inquiries,  proposals or offers with
respect to, or the making, or the completion of, a Takeover Proposal;

(ii)  participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations  with, or furnish
or disclose  any  non-public  information  relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or otherwise  cooperate with or assist any Person in connection
with a Takeover Proposal;

(iii) withdraw, modify, qualify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in any
manner adverse to Parent or MergerCo;

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal;

(v) enter into any letter of intent,  agreement in principle,  merger agreement,
acquisition  agreement,  option agreement or other similar agreement (other than

"COMPANY ACQUISITION AGREEMENT"); or

(vi) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b)  The  Company  shall,   and  shall  cause  each  of  its   Subsidiaries  and
Representatives to, immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or

indicated an intention to make a Takeover  Proposal.  The Company shall promptly
inform its Representatives of the Company's obligations under this Section 6.4.

                                       42

<PAGE>

(c) The Company shall notify Parent  promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
upon receipt by it or its  Subsidiaries or  Representatives  of (i) any Takeover
Proposal or  indication by any Person that it is  considering  making a Takeover
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries  other than  requests for  information  in the ordinary
course of business and unrelated to a Takeover  Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or
request for discussions or  negotiations  regarding any Takeover  Proposal.  The
Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) with the
identity  of  such  Person  and a copy of such  Takeover  Proposal,  indication,
inquiry or request (or,  where no such copy is available,  a description of such
Takeover Proposal,  indication, inquiry or request), including any modifications
thereto.  The Company shall keep Parent  reasonably  informed on a current basis
(and  in  any  event  within  24  hours  of  the   occurrence  of  any  changes,
developments,  discussions or  negotiations)  of the status of any such Takeover
Proposal,  indication,  inquiry or request  (including  the  material  terms and
conditions  thereof  and  of  any  modification   thereto),   and  any  material
developments,  discussions and negotiations,  including furnishing copies of any
written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries
of any material oral inquiries or discussions.  Without  limiting the foregoing,
the Company  shall  promptly  (and in any event within 24 hours)  notify  Parent
orally and in writing if it  determines  to begin  providing  information  or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.4(d).  The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality  agreement with any Person subsequent to the date
of this Agreement,  and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party
to any agreement, which prohibits the Company from providing such information to
Parent.  The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to,
terminate,  waive,  amend or modify any provision of any existing  standstill or
confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and
the Company shall,  and shall cause its  Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions
of any such agreement.

(d)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Company shall be permitted,  if it has
otherwise  complied with its obligations  under this Section 6.4, but only prior
to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, to:

(i) engage in discussions or  negotiations  with a Person who has made a written
Takeover  Proposal  not  solicited in violation of this Section 6.4 if, prior to
taking such action,  (A) the Company  enters into an Acceptable  Confidentiality
Agreement  with such Person and (B) the Company  Board  determines in good faith
(1) (after  consultation with its financial  advisors and outside legal counsel)
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior  Proposal and (2) (after  consultation  with its outside legal counsel)
that  failure to take such action  would be  reasonably  likely to  constitute a
breach of its fiduciary  obligations  to the  shareholders  of the Company under
applicable Laws;

(ii) furnish or disclose any non-public  information  relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to a Person who has made a written Takeover Proposal not
solicited in violation of this Section 6.4 if, prior to taking such action,  the
Company  Board in good  faith  makes the  determinations  described  in  Section

                                       43
<PAGE>

6.4(d)(ii),  but only so long as the Company (x) has caused such Person to enter
into an Acceptable  Confidentiality Agreement and (y) concurrently discloses the
same such non-public  information to Parent if such  non-public  information has
not previously been made available to Parent; and

(iii) withdraw,  modify,  qualify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a
manner  adverse to Parent or MergerCo  (any such action  being  referred to as a
"COMPANY ADVERSE RECOMMENDATION  CHANGE") if the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after  consultation with its outside legal counsel,  that failure to
take  such  action  would be  reasonably  likely to  constitute  a breach of its
fiduciary  obligations to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Laws;
PROVIDED,  that prior to any such  withdrawal,  modification,  qualification  or
amendment to the Company Board Recommendation,  (A) the Company shall have given
Parent and MergerCo  prompt written notice  advising  Parent and MergerCo of (x)
the  decision of the Company  Board to take such action and (y) in the event the
decision  relates to a Takeover  Proposal,  the material terms and conditions of
the Takeover Proposal,  including the identity of the party making such Takeover
Proposal  and,  if  available,  a copy  of  the  relevant  proposed  transaction
agreements with such party and other material  documents,  (B) the Company shall
have given Parent and MergerCo four  Business  Days after  delivery of each such
notice to propose  revisions  to the terms of this  Agreement  (or make  another
proposal) and shall have  negotiated in good faith with Parent and MergerCo with
respect  to such  proposed  revisions  or other  proposal,  if any,  and (C) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering the results
of such  negotiations  and  giving  effect to the  proposals  made by Parent and
MergerCo,  if any, and after  consultation  with  outside  legal  counsel,  that
failure to withdraw,  modify or amend the Company Board  Recommendation would be
reasonably  likely to  constitute a breach of its fiduciary  obligations  to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Laws; PROVIDED,  that, in the event
the Company Board does not make the  determination  referred to in clause (C) of
this paragraph but thereafter determines to withdraw,  modify,  qualify or amend
the Company  Board  Recommendation  pursuant to this  Section  6.4(d)(iii),  the
procedures  referred to in clauses  (A),  (B) and (C) above shall apply anew and
shall also  apply to any  subsequent  withdrawal,  amendment,  qualification  or
modification.

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company Board from disclosing
to the shareholders of the Company a position  contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and
Rule 14d-9  promulgated  under the Exchange  Act;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that any
disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar  communication of the
type  contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to be
a  withdrawal,  modification,  qualification  or amendment of the Company  Board
Recommendation  in a manner  adverse to Parent or  MergerCo  unless the  Company
Board (x) expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its shareholders in favor of
adoption of this Agreement or, (y) rejects such other Takeover Proposal.

and MergerCo promptly of (i) any communication from (x) any Governmental Entity,
(y) any counterparty to any Company Joint Venture or (z) any counterparty to any

to be satisfied or result in such satisfaction  being materially  delayed.  With
respect to any of the  foregoing,  the Company  will consult with Parent and its

Company  Shareholders  Meeting and the Merger.  Parent shall  cooperate with the
Company in  connection  with the  preparation  and filing of the  Company  Proxy
Statement,  including  furnishing  the  Company  upon  request  with any and all
information  as may be required to be set forth in the Company  Proxy  Statement
under the Exchange Act. The Company will provide Parent a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon the Company  Proxy  Statement,  or any  amendments or
supplements  thereto,  prior to filing the same with the SEC. In connection with
the filing of the Company Proxy Statement, the Company and Parent will cooperate
to (i) respond as promptly as reasonably  practicable  to any comments  received
from the SEC with  respect to such filing and will consult with each other prior
to providing such  response,  (ii) as promptly as reasonably  practicable  after
consulting  with each other,  prepare  and file any  amendments  or  supplements
necessary to be filed in response to any SEC comments or as required by Law, and
(iv) to the extent  required  by  applicable  Law,  as  promptly  as  reasonably
practicable  prepare,  file  and  distribute  to the  Company  shareholders  any
supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy  Statement if any event shall occur
which  requires  such  action  at any  time  prior to the  Company  Shareholders
Meeting.

(b) The Company Proxy  Statement  will include the Company Board  Recommendation
unless the Company  Board has  withdrawn,  modified or amended the Company Board
Recommendation to the extent permitted under Section 6.4(d).

(c) The Company will call and hold the Company  Shareholders Meeting as promptly
as practicable following the date of this Agreement for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite  Company Vote.  The Company will (a) take all  reasonable  actions
permitted  by Law to  solicit  or cause to be  solicited  from its  shareholders
proxies  in favor of  adoption  of this  Agreement  and (b)  subject  to Section
6.4(d),  take all other  reasonable  action  necessary  to secure the  Requisite
Company  Vote,  including,  if  requested  by Parent (and at  Parent's  expense)
engaging a  nationally  recognized  proxy  solicitor  reasonably  acceptable  to
Parent.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,  unless this Agreement
is terminated in accordance  with Section 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4, the Company will
take all of the actions  contemplated  by this Section 6.6 regardless of whether
the Company has approved,  endorsed or recommended  another Takeover Proposal or
has withdrawn,  modified or amended the Company Board  Recommendation,  and will
submit this  Agreement for adoption by the  shareholders  of the Company at such
meeting.

Section  6.7.......EMPLOYEES;  BENEFIT  PLANS.  (a)  For a  period  of one  year
following  the  Closing  Date  (the   "CONTINUATION   PERIOD"),   the  Surviving
Corporation  will provide current  employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(other than those employees covered by a collective  bargaining agreement) as of
the  Effective  Time who  continue  employment  with the  Surviving  Corporation
("EMPLOYEES")  with  compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than either (i) those provided  under the Company's  compensation  and
benefit  plans,  programs,   policies,  practices  and  arrangements  (excluding
equity-based programs) in effect at the Effective Time (it being understood that
discretionary  incentive  programs  will  remain  discretionary)  or (ii)  those
provided to similarly  situated  employees of the Surviving  Corporation and its
Affiliates; PROVIDED, however, that nothing herein will prevent the amendment or
termination  of any

                                       46
<PAGE>

specific plan,  program or arrangement,  require that the Surviving  Corporation
provide or permit  investment in the securities of the Surviving  Corporation or
any of its  Affiliates or interfere  with the Surviving  Corporation's  right or
obligation to make such changes as are necessary to comply with  applicable Law.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing herein shall
preclude the  Surviving  Corporation  from  terminating  the  employment  of any
Employee  for any  reason  for which the  Company  could  have  terminated  such
Employee prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Subject to Section 3.5, the Surviving  Corporation  and its Affiliates  will
honor all Company Benefit Plans (including any severance,  retention,  change of
control and similar plans,  agreements and written  arrangements)  in accordance
with their terms as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time,  subject
to any  amendment  or  termination  thereof that may be permitted by such plans,
agreements or written arrangements.

(c)  Under the  employee  benefit  plans of the  Surviving  Corporation  and its
Affiliates  providing  benefits to any Employees  after the Effective  Time (the
"NEW  PLANS"),  each  Employee will be credited with his or her years of service
with the  Company  and its  Affiliates  before  the  Effective  Time  (including
predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and
its Affiliates have given credit for prior service),  to the same extent as such
Employee was  entitled,  before the  Effective  Time, to credit for such service
under the  corresponding  Company  Benefit Plan, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not benefit accrual),  but shall not receive credit for any purpose
where service credit for the applicable  period is not provided to  participants
generally,  and to the extent  such  credit  would  result in a  duplication  of
benefits. In addition,  and without limiting the generality of the foregoing (i)
each Employee  immediately will be eligible to participate,  without any waiting
time,  in any and all New  Plans  to the  extent  coverage  under  such New Plan
replaces  coverage under a similar or comparable  Company  Benefit Plan in which
such Employee  participated  immediately  before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively,  the "OLD PLANS") and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical,  dental,  pharmaceutical  and/or vision  benefits to any Employee,  the
Surviving  Corporation  will cause all  pre-existing  condition  exclusions  and
actively-at-work  requirements  of such New Plan to be waived for such  Employee
and  his or her  covered  dependents,  to the  extent  any  such  exclusions  or
requirements  were waived or were  inapplicable  under any similar or comparable
Company  Benefit  Plan,  and the Surviving  Corporation  will cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her covered  dependents during the
portion  of the plan year of the Old Plan  ending  on the date  such  Employee's
participation  in the  corresponding  New Plan  begins to be taken into  account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all  deductible,  coinsurance and
maximum  out-of-pocket  requirements  applicable to such Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid
in accordance with such New Plan.

(d) No  provision  of this  Section 6.7 will create any third party  beneficiary
rights in any current or former employee,  director or consultant of the Company
or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued  employment (or resumed

                                       47
<PAGE>

employment)  or any other  matter,  nor is any  provision  of this  Section  6.7
intended to nor shall it be construed as amending in any way any Company Benefit
Plan.

Section  6.8.......DIRECTORS'  AND OFFICERS'  INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. (a)
The Surviving  Corporation will (i) maintain in effect for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, if available,  the current  policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (PROVIDED, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with reputable and  financially  sound  carriers,  of at least the same
coverage and amounts  containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable
to the directors and officers of the Company) or (ii) obtain as of the Effective
Time  "tail"  insurance  policies  with a claims  period of six  years  from the
Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing  terms
and  conditions  that are no less favorable to the directors and officers of the
Company,  in each case with  respect to claims  arising  out of or  relating  to
events which occurred before or at the Effective Time; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that
in no event  will the  Surviving  Corporation  be  required  to expend an annual
premium for such  coverage in excess of 200% of the last annual  premium paid by
the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the "MAXIMUM
PREMIUM").  If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be
obtained at an annual  premium in excess of the Maximum  Premium,  the Surviving
Corporation  will obtain that amount of directors'  and officers'  insurance (or
"tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

(b) The provisions of this Section 6.8 will survive the Closing and are intended
to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and
its  successors  and  representatives  after the Effective Time and their rights
under  this  Section  6.8 are in  addition  to,  and  will not be  deemed  to be
exclusive  of,  any other  rights  to which an  Indemnified  Party is  entitled,
whether  pursuant to Law,  Contract,  the Company  Organizational  Documents (or
similar  organizational  document) of the  Surviving  Corporation  or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise.

(c) Following  the Effective  Time,  the Surviving  Corporation  and each of its
Subsidiaries  shall include and maintain in effect in their respective  Articles
of Incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational  document) for a period of
six years after the Effective  Time,  provisions  regarding the  elimination  of
liability of directors (or their  equivalent),  indemnification  of officers and
directors  thereof and  advancement  of expenses which are, with respect to each
such  entity,  no less  advantageous  to the  intended  beneficiaries  than  the
corresponding  provisions  contained in such organizational  documents as of the
date of this Agreement.

(d) In the event that the  Surviving  Corporation  or any of its  successors  or
assigns  (i)  consolidates  with or  merges  into  any  other  Persons,  or (ii)
transfers all or  substantially  all of its  properties or assets to any Person,
then and in each  case,  proper  provision  will be made so that the  applicable
successors,  assigns or  transferees  assume the  obligations  set forth in this
Section 6.8.

conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with  applicable  Laws,
each of the parties to this Agreement  will use all reasonable  efforts to take,
or cause to be taken,  all  actions  and to do, or cause to be done,  all things
necessary,  proper or  advisable  to  ensure  that the  conditions  set forth in
Article VII are satisfied and to consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by
this  Agreement as promptly as  practicable,  including (i) using all reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary  actions or  nonactions,  waivers,  consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary  registrations and
filings  and  taking  all  steps as may be  reasonably  necessary  to  obtain an
approval  or  waiver  from,  or  to  avoid  an  action  or  proceeding  by,  any
Governmental  Entity,  (ii) making, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within 20 Business  Days),  an appropriate  filing of a Notification  and Report
Form  pursuant  to the HSR Act with  respect  to the  transactions  contemplated
hereby and not extending  any waiting  period under the HSR Act or entering into
any  agreement  with  the U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission  (the  "FTC")  or the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "ANTITRUST  DIVISION")
not to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  except with
the prior written consent of the other party hereto,  (iii) making,  as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within 15 Business Days),  appropriate  filings
(a) under the EC Merger Regulation,  if required, and (b) if required, under any
other antitrust,  competition or premerger  notification,  trade regulation Law,
regulation or Order, (iv) obtaining all consents,  approvals or waivers from, or
taking other actions with respect to, third parties necessary or advisable to be
obtained  or taken in  connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that without the prior written consent of Parent,
the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  may not pay or commit  to pay any  material
amount of cash or other consideration,  or incur or commit to incur any material
liability or other  obligation,  in  connection  with  obtaining  such  consent,
approval or waiver,  (v) subject to first having used all reasonable  efforts to
negotiate a resolution of any objections underlying such lawsuits or other legal
proceedings,  using  reasonable  efforts to defend and contest  any  lawsuits or
other legal proceedings,  whether judicial or  administrative,  challenging this
Agreement  or  the  consummation  of  the  transactions   contemplated  by  this
Agreement,  including  using  reasonable  efforts  to seek to have  any  stay or
temporary  restraining  order  entered  by any  Governmental  Entity  vacated or
reversed, and (vi) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the transactions  contemplated  hereby, and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

(b)  Parent  and the  Company  will  cooperate  and  consult  with each other in
connection  with the  making of all such  filings,  notifications  and any other
material  actions  pursuant to this Section 6.9,  subject to applicable  Law, by
permitting  counsel for the other party to review in  advance,  and  consider in
good  faith  the views of the  other  party in  connection  with,  any  proposed
material  written  communication  to any  Governmental  Entity and by  providing
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and  submissions  made by
such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any
Governmental  Entity and any other  information  supplied by such party and such
party's Affiliates to a Governmental Entity or received from such a Governmental
Entity in  connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that material may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply

                                       49
<PAGE>

with contractual arrangements,  and (y) as necessary to address good faith legal
privilege  or  confidentiality  concerns.  The Company  shall not consent to any
voluntary  extension  of any  statutory  deadline  or  waiting  period or to any
voluntary  delay of the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement  at the  behest of any  Governmental  Entity  without  the  consent of
Parent.  The  parties  hereto  may,  as  each  deems  advisable  and  necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively  sensitive material provided to the other
under this  Section  6.9 as  "outside  counsel  only."  Such  materials  and the
information  contained  therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers,  or directors of the recipient,  unless express written  permission is
obtained in advance from the party delivering the materials.

(c) Each of Parent and the  Company  will  promptly  inform the other party upon
receipt of any material  communication  from the FTC, the Antitrust  Division or
any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates)
receives a request for additional  information or documentary  material from any
such  Governmental  Entity that is related to the  transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to
be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party,  an  appropriate  response in compliance  with such request.  The parties
agree not to participate,  or to permit their Affiliates to participate,  in any
substantive  meeting or discussion  with any  Governmental  Entity in connection
with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement unless it so consults with
the  other  party  in  advance  and,  to  the  extent  not  prohibited  by  such
Governmental  Entity,  gives  the  other  party the  opportunity  to attend  and
participate.   Each  party  will  advise  the  other   party   promptly  of  any
understandings,  undertakings  or agreements  (oral or written)  which the first
party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any
other  Governmental  Entity in connection with the transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement.  In furtherance  and not in limitation of the  foregoing,  each
party will use all  reasonable  efforts to resolve  any  objections  that may be
asserted with respect to the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Laws.

(d)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  nothing  contained in this Agreement shall
require or obligate  Parent or its  Affiliates  to, and the  Company  shall not,
without  the prior  written  consent of Parent:  (i) agree or  otherwise  become
subject to any restrictions,  conditions,  limitations or other understanding on
or  with  respect  to  the  operation  of the  business  of  Parent,  any of its
Affiliates,  or the Company in any material respect;  or (ii) agree or otherwise
be  required  to sell or  otherwise  dispose  of,  hold  separate  (through  the
establishment of a trust or otherwise), or divest itself of any business, assets
or operations of Parent, any of its Affiliates, or the Company.

Section 6.10......PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent and the Company will consult with
each other  before  issuing  any press  release or  otherwise  making any public
statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement.  Neither  Parent nor the Company will issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation,  except to the extent
that the  disclosing  party

                                       50
<PAGE>

requirements  of the New York Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Global Select Market,
in which  case that party will use all  reasonable  efforts to consult  with the
other party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement.

connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the

party incurring those Expenses, except as otherwise provided in Sections 8.6 and
8.7 and except  that the HSR filing  fee and any filing fee  required  under the
German pre-merger notification Law shall be paid by Parent.

Section  6.13......TAKEOVER  STATUTES.  If any  takeover  statute  is or becomes
applicable to this  Agreement,  the Voting  Agreements,  the Merger or the other
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting  Agreements,  each of
Parent and the Company and their  respective  boards of directors  will (a) take
all necessary  action to ensure that such  transactions  may be  consummated  as
promptly as  practicable  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this  Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such takeover statute.

Section  6.14......RESIGNATIONS.  To the extent  requested  by Parent in writing
prior to Closing  Date,  on the  Closing  Date,  the  Company  shall cause to be
delivered  to Parent duly signed  resignations,  effective  as of the  Effective
Time,  of the  directors of the Company  Subsidiaries  designated  by Parent and
shall take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Section  6.15......SHAREHOLDER  LITIGATION.  The  Company  shall give Parent the
opportunity  to  participate  in the defense or  settlement  of any  shareholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated  hereby,  and no such litigation  shall be settled without Parent's
prior written consent.

Section  6.16......RULE  16B-3.  Prior to the Effective  Time, the Company shall

pursuant to the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a  director  or  officer  of the  Company  to be exempt  under Rule 16b-3
promulgated  under the Exchange Act in  accordance  with that certain  No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

Section  8.4.......TERMINATION  BY THE COMPANY. This Agreement may be terminated
by the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time:

(a) if a breach or failure of any representation, warranty or covenant of Parent

would give rise to the  failure of a  condition  set forth in Section  7.3(a) or
Section  7.3(b)  and (ii) has not been  cured by  Parent or  MergerCo  within 10
calendar days after Parent's receipt of written notice of such breach or failure

enters into a definitive  agreement providing for the consummation of a Superior
Proposal  pursuant to and in accordance  with the  provisions of Section 6.4 and
(iii) in  accordance  with  Section  8.6, the Company pays to Parent the Company
Termination Fee.

Section  8.5.......EFFECT  OF  TERMINATION.  If  this  Agreement  is  terminated
pursuant to this Article  VIII,  written  notice  thereof  shall be given to the
other party or parties,  specifying the provision  hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement  shall  forthwith  become void and of no
further  force and effect,  with no  liability  on the part of any party to this
Agreement  (or  any  shareholder,   director,   officer,   employee,   agent  or
Representative  of such  party);  PROVIDED,  that,  nothing in this  Section 8.5
(including  termination)  shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability
for willful breach.  The provisions of Section 6.12,  this Section 8.5,  Section
8.6, Section 8.7 and Article IX will survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 8.6.......COMPANY TERMINATION FEE. (a) The Company will pay, or cause to
be paid,  to an account or accounts  designated  by Parent,  by wire transfer of
immediately  available  funds an  amount  equal  to  $22,500,000  (the  "COMPANY
TERMINATION FEE"):

(i) if this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent  pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or
Section  8.3(b),  in which event  payment will be made within two Business  Days
after such  termination  or (B) by the Company  pursuant to Section  8.4(b),  in
which event payment will be made concurrently with such termination; or

(ii) if (A) a Takeover  Proposal  (or the  intention of any Person to make one),
whether or not  conditional,  shall have been made known to or  proposed  to the
Company or otherwise publicly announced or disclosed prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Company Vote, (B) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company  pursuant to Section  8.2(a)  (but,  only for  purposes of this  Section
8.6(a)(ii), only if the Requisite Company Vote has not been received at the time
of such  termination) or Section 8.2(b) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(c),
and (C) within 15 months  following  the date of such  termination,  the Company
enters into a  definitive  agreement  providing  for the  implementation  of any
Takeover  Proposal or  consummates  any Takeover  Proposal  (whether or not such
Takeover  Proposal was the same Takeover  Proposal  referred to in the foregoing
clause  (A)),  in which  event  payment  will be made

                                       55
<PAGE>

on or prior to the  date on  which  the  Company  enters  into  such  definitive
agreement or consummates such Takeover Proposal, as applicable.  For purposes of
the  foregoing  clause  (C)  only,  references  in the  definition  of the  term
"Takeover  Proposal"  to the figure  "15%" will be deemed to be  replaced by the
figure "50%."

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.6(a) are
an  integral  part of the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  that
without these  agreements  Parent and MergerCo  would not have entered into this
Agreement,  and that any  amounts  payable  pursuant  to  Section  8.6(a) do not
constitute  a penalty.  If the  Company  fails to pay Parent  and  MergerCo  any
amounts due to Parent and MergerCo  pursuant to Section  8.6(a)  within the time
periods  specified  in  Section  8.6(a),  the  Company  shall  pay the costs and
expenses  (including  reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and
MergerCo in  connection  with any action,  including  the filing of any lawsuit,
taken to collect payment of such amounts,  together with interest on such unpaid
amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing  during such period as published in
The Wall Street Journal,  calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts
were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.

(c) Except as set forth in this  Section 8.6 and in Section  8.7,  all  Expenses
incurred in connection  with this  Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated
hereby will be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.12.

Section 8.7.......PARENT TERMINATION FEE.

(a) In the event that (i)(A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent,  on the one
hand, or the Company,  on the other hand,  pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and (B) at
the time of such  termination,  all conditions to the obligations of the parties
to  consummate  the Merger have been  satisfied  or waived  other than those set
forth in Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c),  or (ii) this Agreement is terminated
by Parent,  on the one hand,  or the  Company,  on the other  hand,  pursuant to
Section 8.2(c),  then in either case Parent shall pay promptly (but in any event
within two Business Days) following receipt of an invoice  therefor,  all of the
Company's  actual and  reasonably  documented  out-of-pocket  fees and  expenses
(including  reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by the Company
and its  Subsidiaries  on or  prior  to the  termination  of this  Agreement  in
connection with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement as directed by
the Company in writing, which amount shall not be greater than $1 million.

(b) Parent  acknowledges that the agreements  contained in Section 8.7(a) are an
integral part of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  that without
these  agreements  the Company would not have entered into this  Agreement,  and
that any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.7(a) do not constitute a penalty.
If Parent  fails to pay the Company  any amounts due to the Company  pursuant to
Section 8.7(a) within the time period specified in Section 8.7(a),  Parent shall
pay the  costs and  expenses  (including  reasonable  legal  fees and  expenses)
incurred by the Company in connection  with any action,  including the filing of
any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate  prevailing  during such period as
published in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,  calculated on a

                                       56
<PAGE>

daily basis from the date such amounts  were  required to be paid until the date
of actual payment.

Section  8.8.......AMENDMENT.  This  Agreement  may be amended by the parties to
this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time,  whether before or after
shareholder approval hereof,  PROVIDED that (a) after necessary approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the  shareholders of the Company,  no amendment that
requires further shareholder approval under applicable Laws will be made without
such required  further  approval and (b) such amendment has been duly authorized
or approved by each of Parent,  MergerCo and the Company. This Agreement may not
be amended  except by an instrument in writing  signed by each of the parties to
this Agreement.

Section  8.9.......EXTENSION;  WAIVER.  At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and MergerCo,  on the one hand,  and the Company,  on the other hand, may
(a) extend the time for the  performance of any of the  obligations of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the  representations  and warranties of the
other party contained in this Agreement or in any document  delivered under this
Agreement,  or (c) unless  prohibited by applicable  Laws, waive compliance with
any of the covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any  extension  or waiver will be valid only if set forth
in an  instrument in writing  signed by such party.  The failure of any party to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.2.......SURVIVAL. None of the representations and warranties contained
in this  Agreement or in any  instrument  delivered  under this  Agreement  will
survive the Effective  Time. This Section 9.2 does not limit any covenant of the

Section  9.4.......WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
any  controversy  which may arise  under  this  Agreement  is likely to  involve
complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and
