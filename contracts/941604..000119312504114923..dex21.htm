Effective Time):



(a) (i) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(ii)

Share upon exercise of such Warrant, multiplied by (2) the number of Shares
for which such Warrant is exercisable;



(v) Randall J. Fagundo shall repay the RF Loan Amount at Closing by having the

an amount equal to 10% of the Common Merger Consideration otherwise payable
to each Stockholder, Optionholder or Warrantholder multiplied by the number of
Shares that such Stockholder owns at Closing, or in the case of an
Optionholder or Warrantholder, the number of Shares that such Optionholder or
Warrantholder would have owned had such Optionholder or Warrantholder
exercised their respective Options or Warrants at Closing, shall be withheld
from such Stockholder, Optionholder or Warrantholder and deposited in the
Indemnity Account;

a preliminary projected balance sheet as of the anticipated Closing (the "

Company shall consult with Parent during the preparation of the Company
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Company Estimated NWC. 



(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event more than
twenty-one (21) days after the Closing, Parent shall prepare a schedule
calculating the Net Working Capital prepared in accordance with the provisions
set forth on Exhibits 2.6(b) and 2.6(b)(i) (the " _Parent Estimated NWC_ "),
and may engage KPMG LLP or such other nationally recognized accounting firm to
verify the determination of the Parent Estimated NWC at Parents sole cost.
The Parent Estimated NWC shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions
set forth on Exhibits 2.6(b) and 2.6(b)(i). The Parent Estimated NWC shall be
promptly delivered to the Stockholder Representative as soon as it is
available for review and comment, and Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall thereafter attempt to reach agreement on the Parent

Representative shall present any objections or comments in writing to Parent
no later than ten (10) days after the Stockholder Representatives receipt of
the Parent Estimated NWC, specifying in reasonable detail any objections
thereto (the " _NWC Dispute Notice_ "). Parent and the Company shall be deemed
to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Parent
Estimated NWC. If within twenty (20) business days after Parents receipt of
the NWC Dispute Notice, Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable
to resolve informally matters raised by the NWC Dispute Notice and the
Stockholder Representative has not retracted the NWC Dispute Notice, the
parties shall submit the NWC Dispute Notice to the Accounting Arbitrator for



 

-13- resolution. If the parties are unable to agree upon one Accounting Arbitrator,
each shall appoint an Accounting Arbitrator and these appointees shall
appoint a third Accounting Arbitrator (collectively the " _Accounting
Arbitrators_ "), in which case the resolution of the items contained in the
NWC Dispute Notice shall be made by a majority decision of the Accounting
Arbitrators. The Accounting Arbitrator(s) shall be directed to make a
resolution within thirty (30) days of engagement limited to those areas at
issue and determined in accordance with Exhibits 2.6(b) and 2.6(b)(i), and
such resolution shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall each pay the costs and expense of their own
Accounting Arbitrator, accountants and attorneys and shall bear equally
the expense of the independent Accounting Arbitrator.



(e) To the extent that the Companys Net Working Capital as of the Closing
(as finally determined in accordance with the provisions set forth above, a "
_Final NWC Determination_ ") results in a Net Working Capital figure of
over $9,000,000, then no adjustment of Merger Consideration shall be
required.



(f) To the extent that a Final NWC Determination results in a Net Working
Capital figure that is less than $9,000,000 (with the amount by which
$10,000,000 exceeds the Net Working Capital being the " _Final NWC Decrease_
"), then within five (5) business days following such Final NWC Determination,
the Stockholder Representative shall pay Parent an amount of cash equal to
such Final NWC Decrease from the Indemnity Account.



(g) Any adjustments in connection with the Net Working Capital in
this Section 2.6 shall be treated as a decrease in the Merger Consideration.



(h) Upon the Final NWC Determination and payment of the Final NWC Decrease, if
any, each Stockholder, Warrantholder and Optionholder shall be paid his, her
or its Pro Rata Percentage of any balance in the Indemnity Account.

(d) In the event the Merger is not completed, Parent shall reimburse the
Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing
assistance to the Parent in accordance with Section 5.7(b) and (c), including
any travel expenses for employees of the Company in connection with a road
show, accountant fees for the comfort letter and other reasonably related
documented expenses; provided, however, that Parent shall not be obliged to
reimburse the Company for more than $250,000 in aggregate expenses.
Parent hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each of the Acquired
Corporations and each Person who at or prior to the Effective Time was or is a
member, manager, partner, stockholder, director, officer, agent, advisor,
assign, representative or Affiliate of an Acquired Corporation (and their
respective managers, partners, stockholders, directors, officers, agents,
advisors, assigns, representatives or Affiliates) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ " and individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from
and against any and all losses, claims, damages, expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges for counsel and
costs of investigation incurred by any Indemnified Party in any action or
proceeding between it and the Parent or between it and any third party or
otherwise) or liabilities resulting from or arising out of the use by the
Parent of such information in such offering materials or otherwise in
connection with any such offering or that arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , no Indemnified Party shall be indemnified against
any of the foregoing to the extent such loss, claim, damage or expense
resulted from an untrue statement of a material fact contained in written
information furnished by such Indemnified Party to the Parent specifically
for inclusion in the Approved Materials or the omission to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.



Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) any amounts
paid out by the Acquired Corporations for expenses incurred in providing
assistance to the Parent in accordance with Sections 5.4(b), 5.7(b) and 5.7(c)
will reduce the amount of the Loan Repayment Amount deductible from the
Merger Consideration and (ii) any payables incurred in providing such
assistance and not yet paid shall not be included in the calculation of Net
Working Capital.

legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in
connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond thereto.



5.9 Other Actions



Except as contemplated or otherwise permitted by this Agreement,
neither Holdings, Parent, any Acquired Corporation nor the Stockholder
Representative shall, nor shall any such Person permit any Subsidiary to, take
or agree or commit to take any action that is reasonably likely to result in
any of its respective representations or warranties hereunder being untrue in

Parent agrees to use its best efforts to obtain the Financing Amount from J.P.

financing cannot be procured at an average interest cost, incorporating any
issuance discount (but not including customary underwriting, lender, agent

of which not more than 50% of the principal amount of such financing would be
senior secured financing, or (b) such financing cannot be obtained on
customary terms and conditions for the types and levels of financing involved.

Holdings and each of the Stockholders of Holdings, effective as of the
approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the Stockholders of Holdings and
without any further action on the part of Holdings or the Stockholders, shall
be deemed to have consented to the appointment effective as of the Effective
Time of Wellspring Capital Management LLC as the representative of the
Stockholders as of the Effective Time (the " _Effective Time Stockholders_
"), the attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each such Person and the taking
of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted
to be taken by the Stockholders under, or in respect of, this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the exercise of the power to (i) agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and comply with orders of
courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to the Final NWC Determination,
(ii) receive, maintain and disburse funds in the Indemnity Account in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and (iii) take all actions
necessary in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all 



 

-68- of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement. Accordingly,
the Stockholder Representative has unlimited authority and power to act on
behalf of each Effective Time Stockholder with respect to this Agreement and
the disposition, settlement or other handling of all funds in the Indemnity
Account.



(b) The appointment of the Stockholder Representative under this
Section 9.11, shall be non-rescindable and irrevocable and each Effective
Time Stockholder will be bound by all actions taken by the Stockholder
Representative in connection with this Agreement and the Indemnity Account,
and the Parent and the Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to rely, and will
incur no liability with respect to such reliance, on any action, consent,
instruction or decision of Stockholder Representative as the action, consent,
instruction or decision of each Effective Time Stockholder (and shall have no
responsibility or obligation to determine the authority, authenticity,
accuracy or truth thereof). The Stockholder Representative will incur no
liability with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in reliance upon
any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper person (and
shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for
any other action or inaction, except its own willful misconduct or gross
negligence. The Effective Time Stockholders shall severally indemnify the
Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless,
in each case on a Stockholder Pro Rata Basis, against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without bad faith on the part of the Stockholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and/or
administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties hereunder.



(c) In all questions arising under this Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative may rely on the advice of counsel, and the Stockholder
Representative will not be liable to any Effective Time Stockholder for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Stockholder
Representative based on such advice. The fees and costs of such counsel may
be charged against any amounts payable to the Effective Time Stockholders, the
Optionholders and the Warrantholders out of the Indemnity Account.



(d) The Stockholder Representative shall serve in such capacity
without compensation, provided that any costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, fees and disbursements of its counsel, accountants and
other financial, legal, accounting or other advisors) incurred by it or its
Affiliates in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
Section 9.11 may be charged against the Indemnity Account.



9.12 Severability



If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Legal Requirement or public policy, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon any judicial determination that any term or other



 

-69- provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only
in part, degree or certain jurisdictions will remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, each party waives any provision of law that renders any
provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.



9.13 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance



The rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not
alternative). The parties hereby agree that in the event of any breach
or threatened breach of any covenant, obligation or other provision set forth
in this Agreement for the benefit of the other party, such other party shall
be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it) to
(a) a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or other provision,
and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.



9.14 Construction



(a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders.



(b) The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied
in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.



(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."



(d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this
Agreement.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
transmission, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of
the executing party with the same force and effect as if such facsimile
signature page were an original thereof.
