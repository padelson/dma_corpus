Article III 
CONSIDERATION

 \t\t

3.1 Closing Payment Shares.

 \t\t

(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock will be issued pursuant to the Share Exchange, and such
fractional share interests will be rounded down to the nearest whole share and
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of the Purchaser. The Closing Payment Shares shall bear the legend set forth
in Section 3.1(b) and shall be subject to terms of the Lock-Up Agreement.

 \t\t

(b) Legend. Each certificate issued to any holder of Company Common Shares in
connection with the Share Exchange shall bear the legend set forth below, or
legend substantially equivalent thereto, together with any other legends that
may be required by any securities laws at the time of the issuance of the
Purchaser Common Stock:

 \t\t

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT") OR THE SECURITIES
LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL (I) SUCH
OFFER, SALE, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
ACT AND THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION COVERING SUCH
SECURITIES OR (II) THE ISSUER OF THE SHARES HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR
TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND SUCH OTHER
APPLICABLE LAWS.

 \t\t

3.2 Pre-Closing Adjustment for Closing Indebtedness.

 \t\t

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Determination Date" shall be the
date that is five (5) calendar days prior to the anticipated date for Closing,
as agreed upon by the Company and Purchaser at least ten (10) calendar days
prior to the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting. On or prior to the Determination
Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a closing
statement (when finalized pursuant to this Section 3.2, the "Closing
Statement"), setting forth: (i) the Closing Payment Shares and Purchaser
Common Stock issuable under the Converted Options pursuant to Section 2.2; and
(ii) the Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"). The
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and prepared
consistently with the most recent audited financial statements of the Company
made available to the Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement, and
otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.

 \t\t

(b) The Purchaser shall review the Closing Statement promptly after the
delivery of the same by the Company. The Company shall, upon reasonable
request, provide the Purchaser with applicable work papers used in the
preparation of the Closing Statement. If the Purchaser does not agree with the
content of the Closing Statement, the Purchaser shall raise objection by
delivering a written statement of objection (the "Notice of Objection") to the
Company within two (2) calendar days after the receipt of the Closing
Statement from the Company, specifying in reasonable detail the item(s) which
are disputed, the basis of such disputes and the changes the Purchaser
considers necessary. The Closing Statement shall become binding and conclusive
on the parties for the purpose of the determination of the number of Closing
Payment Shares and Purchaser Common Stock issuable under the Converted Options
(and the Closing Indebtedness) if the Purchaser does not deliver a Notice of
Objection to the Company pursuant to and in accordance with this paragraph.

 \t\t

(c) If the Purchaser delivers a Notice of Objection in accordance with
paragraph (b) above, then the parties shall first try to resolve the objected
items through mutual consultation. If any objected items cannot be resolved
through mutual consultation within three (3) calendar days from the date of
the Notice of Objection, such dispute shall be submitted to WithumSmith+Brown,
PC or such other firm mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the Company
(the "Independent Accountant") for final determination; provided that, if the
Independent Accountant does not accept its appointment and/or if the Purchaser
and the Company cannot agree on the Independent Accountant, in either case
within five (5) calendar days after the date on which the dispute is submitted

 \t\t

  \t\t

11

    \t

 \t\t

to the Independent Accountant in accordance with this Section 3.2(c), then
either the Purchaser or the Company may require, by written notice to the
other, that the Independent Accountant be selected by the New York City
Regional Office of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") in
accordance with the AAA's procedures. The Independent Accountant shall be an
independent (i.e., no prior material business relationship with any party for
the prior two (2) years) accounting firm. The parties agree that the
Independent Accountant will be deemed to be independent even though a party or
its Affiliates may, in the future, designate the Independent Accountant to
resolve disputes of the types described in this Section 3.2.

 \t\t

(d) If any items in dispute are submitted to the Independent Accountant for
final determination, (i) each of the Purchaser and the Company shall furnish
to the Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed items as the Independent Accountant may
request and are available to that party, and shall be afforded the opportunity
to present to the Independent Accountant any material relating to the
determination and to discuss the determination with the Independent
Accountant; (ii) the Independent Accountant shall be directed to, within ten
(10) calendar days after submission of the issues, deliver a notice to each of
the Purchaser and the Company, setting forth its adjustment or revision of the
Closing Statement, and/or the resolution of all issues in dispute; (iii) the
Closing Statement, as adjusted or otherwise revised and finally determined by
the Independent Accountant, as set forth in its notice delivered to each of
the Company and the Purchaser, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties
and the parties shall delay the Closing until the resolution of the matters
described in this Section 3.2(d); and (iv) the costs of the Independent
Accountant shall be paid by the Company (on one hand) and the Purchaser (on
the other hand) in the same proportion that the aggregate disputed amount so
submitted to the Independent Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such party as finally determined by the Independent Accountant bears to
the total disputed amount.

 \t\t

(e) Upon finalization of the Closing Statement, the parties agree that the
Purchaser shall issue the Closing Payment Shares and assume the Converted
Options pursuant to Article II.

 \t\t

(f) Each of the Company and the Purchaser shall bear the fees, costs and
expenses of its own accountants.

 \t\t

3.3 Earnout Payment.

(a) In the event the volume weighted average sale price of the Purchaser
Common Stock equals or exceeds the stock prices set forth below for any 20
Trading Days within a 30-day Trading Day period from and after the Closing
until the applicable milestone date set forth below, the Stockholders shall be
entitled to receive, and the Purchaser shall promptly (but no later than five
(5) Business Days), cause to be issued, as additional consideration for the

All share and per share amounts shall be proportionally adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, and similar events.

 \t\t

(b) At all times prior to the latest milestone date set forth in Section
3.3(a) (the "Earnout Period"), the Purchaser shall keep available for issuance
a sufficient number of unissued shares of Purchaser Common Stock to permit the
Purchaser to satisfy its issuance obligations set forth in this Section 3.3
and shall take all actions required to increase the authorized number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient
unissued shares of Purchaser Common Stock to permit such reservation.

 \t\t

(c) In the event that after the Closing and during the Earnout Period, (i)
there is a Change of Control, (ii) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Purchaser (whether voluntary or involuntary) is initiated, (iii) any
bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or similar proceeding under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or any dissolution or liquidation
proceeding, is instituted by or against the Purchaser, or a

 \t\t

  \t\t

    \t

 \t\t

receiver is appointed for the Purchaser or a substantial part of its assets or
properties, or (iv) the Purchaser makes an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or petitions or applies to any Authority for, or consents or
acquiesces to, the appointment of a custodian, receiver or trustee for all or
substantially all of its assets or properties (each of clauses (i) through
(iv), an "Acceleration Event"), then any Earnout Shares that have not been
previously issued by the Purchaser (whether or not previously earned), shall
be deemed earned and due by the Purchaser to the Stockholders upon such
Acceleration Event unless, in the case of an Acceleration Event that is a
Change of Control, the Earnout Shares for Milestone #1 or Milestone #2 shall
not be accelerated if the value of the consideration to be received in
exchange for a share of Purchaser Common Stock in such Change of Control is
lower than the applicable stock price threshold set forth in Section 3.3(a)
for Milestone #1 and Milestone #2, respectively. For purposes hereof, a
"Change of Control" means the occurrence in a single transaction or as a
result of a series of related transactions, of one or more of the following
events: (i) a merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar business
combination transaction involving the Purchaser in which the holders of all of
the outstanding equity interests of the Purchaser immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction do not directly own, beneficially or of
record, immediately upon the consummation of such transaction, outstanding
equity interests that represent a majority of the combined outstanding voting
securities of the surviving entity in such transaction or a parent of the
surviving entity in such transaction; (ii) a transaction in which a majority
of the Purchaser's voting securities are transferred to any Person, or any two
more Persons acting as a group, and all Affiliates of such Person or Persons
(each, a "Group") or (iii) the consummation of the sale of substantially all
of the assets of the Purchaser to any Person or Group.

 \t\t

(d) All distributions of Purchaser Common Stock with respect to the Earnout
Shares during the Earnout Period, including, but not limited to, shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued as a result of a stock dividend, stock split,
combination of shares or otherwise, shall be deemed to be Earnout Shares and
shall be set aside and not issued until the Earnout Shares have been issued to
the Stockholders or, if the Earnout Shares are not earned and issued, then all
such distributions declared during the Earnout Period shall be forfeited.

 \t\t

4.22 Employee Benefits and Compensation.

 \t\t

(a) Each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), bonus,
deferred compensation, equity-based or non-equity-based incentive, severance
or other plan or written agreement relating to employee or director benefits
or employee or director compensation or fringe benefits, maintained or
contributed to by the Company Group and/or with respect to which the Company
Group could reasonably be expected to incur any direct or indirect, fixed or
contingent liability (each a "Plan" and collectively, the "Plans") is and has
been maintained in all material respects in compliance with all applicable
laws, including (if applicable) ERISA, and has been administered and operated
in all material respects in accordance with its terms.

 \t\t

(b) Each Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and no
condition exists which could reasonably be expected to result in the
revocation of any such determination. No event which constitutes a "reportable
event" (as defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA) for which the 30-day notice
requirement has not been waived by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(the "PBGC") has occurred with respect to any Plan. No Plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA has been terminated or is or has been the subject of termination
proceedings pursuant to Title IV of ERISA. Full payment has been made of all
amounts which the Company was required under the terms of the Plans to have
paid as contributions to such Plans on or prior to the date hereof (excluding
any amounts not yet due) and no Plan which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within
the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or
not waived.

 \t\t

(c) Neither the Company nor to the knowledge of the Company, any other
"disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2)
of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively), has engaged in any
transaction in connection with any Plan that could reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of a penalty pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA,
damages pursuant to Section 409 of ERISA or a tax pursuant to Section 4975(a)
of the Code. The Company has not maintained any Plan (other than a Plan which
is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Code) which provides benefits with respect to current or former employees or
directors following their termination of service with the Company (other than
as required pursuant to COBRA). Each Plan subject to the requirements of COBRA
has been operated in substantial compliance therewith.

 \t\t

(d) No Company Employee will accrue or receive additional benefits, service or
accelerated rights to payment of benefits as a direct result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. No material liability, claim, investigation,
audit, action or litigation has been incurred, made, commenced or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, by or against any Plan or the
Company with respect to any Plan (other than for benefits payable in the
ordinary course and PBGC insurance premiums). No Plan or related trust owns
any securities in violation of Section 407 of ERISA. With respect to each Plan
which is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) as of the most recent actuarial valuation report prepared for each such
Plan, the aggregate present value of the accrued liabilities thereof
(determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
35) did not exceed the aggregate fair market value of the assets allocable
thereto.

 \t\t

(e) No Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) and the Company has not been obligated to contribute to any
multiemployer plan. No material liability has been, or could

 \t\t

  \t\t

20

    \t

 \t\t

reasonably be expected to be, incurred under Title IV of ERISA (other than for
PBGC insurance premiums payable in the ordinary course) or Section 412(f) or
(n) of the Code, by the Company or any entity required to be aggregated with
the Company pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and/or Section 414 (b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code with respect to any "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA).

 \t\t

(f) There is no unfunded non-tax-qualified Plan which provides a pension or
retirement benefit.

all material respects; (iv) no waiver, indulgence or postponement of the

Group or, to the Company's knowledge, by any other party thereto; (vi) there

of breach or indemnification or notice of default or termination thereunder.
The Real Property leased by the Company Group is in a state of maintenance and
repair adequate and suitable for the purposes for which it is presently being
used, and there are no repair or restoration works likely to be required in
connection with any of the leased Real Properties, in each case except as
would not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company Group is in physical possession and
actual and exclusive occupation of the whole of the leased property, none of
which is subleased or assigned to another Person. The Lease leases all useable
square footage of the premise located at the leased Real Property. To the
Company's knowledge, the Company Group does not owe any brokerage commission

(a) The Company Group has or will have timely filed, or caused to be timely
filed, (taking into account valid extensions) all income and other material

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company Group, which Tax
Returns are correct and complete in all material respects, and has paid all
Taxes required to be paid by the Company Group other than such Taxes for which
adequate reserves in the Financial Statements have been established, and
except for such Taxes the non-payment of which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company Group. There are no
Actions pending against the Company Group in respect of any material Tax, and
the Company Group has not been notified in writing of any proposed material
Tax claims or assessments against the Company Group (other than, in each case,
claims or assessments that have been settled or otherwise resolved in full).

Group's assets, other than Permitted Liens. The Company Group has no

knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including

income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code.

remedial obligation of the Company Group under any Environmental Laws.

 \t\t

in Purchaser's IPO who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Purchaser
Common Stock pursuant to the Purchaser's certificate of incorporation) to any
portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of

required to be performed by it to date under, and is not in material default
or delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in
connection with, the Trust Agreement, and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, no

proceedings pending with respect to the Trust Account.

which (i) are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Purchaser is made known to the Purchaser's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others and (ii) are effective in all material
respects to perform the functions for which they were established. Since the
Purchaser's inception, there have been no significant deficiencies or material
weakness in the Purchaser's internal control over financial reporting (whether
or not remediated) and no change in the Purchaser's internal control over
financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Purchaser's internal control over financial reporting.

has not received any subpoenas from any Authority, in each case except as
would not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not be, individually or in

material to the Purchaser pending against, or to the best knowledge of the
Purchaser, threatened against or affecting, the Purchaser, any of its officers
or directors with respect to the business of the Purchaser or any securities
of the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's assets or any material contract of
the Purchaser before any court, Authority or official or which in any manner
challenges or seeks to prevent or enjoin the transactions contemplated hereby
or by the Additional Agreements. There are no outstanding judgments against
the Purchaser that would be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 \t\t

5.16 Absence of Certain Changes. Since its formation, the Purchaser has (a)
conducted no business other than its formation, the public offering of its

currently conducted, any acquisition of material property by the Purchaser, or
restricts in any material respect the ability of the Purchaser from engaging
in business as currently conducted by it or from competing with any other
Person (each such contract, a "Purchaser Material Contract"). All Purchaser
Material Contracts have been made available to the Company other than those
that are exhibits to the Purchaser SEC Documents.

 \t\t

(b) With respect to each Purchaser Material Contract: (i) the Purchaser
Material Contract is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in all material
respects against the Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, the
other parties thereto, and is in full force and effect (except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity); (ii) the Purchaser is not in breach or default in any
material respect, and no event has occurred that with the passage of time or
giving of notice or both would constitute such a breach or default in any

the other party, under such Purchaser Material Contract; and (iii) to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, no other party to any Purchaser Material Contract
is in breach or default in any material respect, and no event has occurred

Purchaser is insured by recognized, financially sound and reputable
institutions with policies in such amounts and with such deductibles and
covering such risks as are customarily carried by Persons conducting a
business similar to the Purchaser. The Purchaser has no reason to believe that
it will not be able (i) to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when
such policies expire or (ii) to obtain comparable coverage from similar
institutions as may be necessary or appropriate to conduct its business as now
conducted and at a cost that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. The Purchaser has not been denied any
insurance coverage which it has sought or for which it has applied.

  \t\t

27

    \t

 \t\t

material adverse effect on the Purchaser, which Tax Returns are correct and
complete in all material respects, and has paid all Taxes required to be paid
by the Purchaser other than such Taxes for which adequate reserves in the
Purchaser Financials have been established, and except for such Taxes the non-

any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Share Exchange, from
qualifying as a "reorganization" for U.S. federal income tax purposes within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code.

 \t\t

  \t\t

34

Closing have been satisfied or in determining whether or not any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement have been
breached.

 \t\t

(a) Prior to the filing of a definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC, the
Purchaser shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Purchaser's stockholders (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Purchaser Stockholder Meeting") to
be held as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing of the
definitive Proxy Statement for the sole purpose of obtaining approval of the
Purchaser Stockholder Matters (the "Purchaser Stockholder Approval")
(including any adjournment of such meeting for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement) and such other
matter as may be agreed by the Company. The Purchaser will use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and will take all other reasonable action necessary or
advisable to obtain such proxies and the Purchaser Stockholder Approval and to

Purchaser (i) shall consult with the Company regarding the record date and the
date of the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting and (ii) shall not adjourn or
postpone the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent
of Company; provided that the Purchaser may adjourn or postpone the Purchaser
Stockholder Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Purchaser reasonably determines
(following consultation with Company, except with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal) is necessary to comply with applicable Laws, is provided to the
Purchaser's stockholders in advance of a vote on the adoption of this
Agreement, (B) if, as of the time that the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting is
originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Purchaser Common Stock
represented at such meeting (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting,
or (C) if, as of the time that the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting is originally
scheduled, adjournment or postponement of the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting is
necessary to enable the Purchaser to solicit additional proxies required to
obtain the Purchaser Stockholder Approval; provide that the Purchaser may
postpone or adjourn on one occasion so long as the date of the Purchaser
Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 15
consecutive calendar days in connection with such postponement or adjournment.

 \t\t

(b) (i) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the
Purchaser Board has unanimously recommended that the Purchaser's stockholders
vote in favor of the Purchaser Stockholder Matters at the Purchaser
Stockholder Meeting and (ii) neither the Purchaser Board nor any committee
thereof shall withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or publicly
propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, the

 \t\t

9.3 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
desirable under applicable Laws, and in the case of the Company, as reasonably
requested by Purchaser, to consummate and implement expeditiously each of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto shall execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such other documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and take such other actions as may
be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously
each of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 \t\t

9.4 Compliance with SPAC Agreements. The Company and the Purchaser shall
comply with each of the agreements entered into in connection with the IPO.

 \t\t

9.5 Confidentiality. Except as necessary to complete the Proxy Statement, the
Company and the Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall hold and shall cause their respective representatives to hold in
strict confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of Law, all documents and information
concerning the other party furnished to it by such other party or its
representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except to the extent that such information can be shown to have
been (a) previously known by the party to which it was furnished, (b) in the
public domain through no fault of such party or (c) later lawfully acquired
from other sources on a non-confidential basis, which source is not the agent
of the other party, by the party to which it was furnished, without any breach
by such source of any obligation of confidentiality to the other party), and
each party shall not release or disclose such information to any other person,
except its representatives in connection with this Agreement. In the event
that any party believes that it is required to disclose any such confidential
information pursuant to applicable Laws, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, such party shall give timely written notice to the other party (which,
for clarity, shall in the case of the Company be to the Purchaser and in the
case of the

 \t\t

  \t\t

36

    \t

 \t\t

Purchaser be to the Company) so that such party may have an opportunity to
obtain a protective order or other appropriate relief, and such party shall
only disclose the minimum amount of such confidential information so required
to be disclosed. The parties acknowledge that some previously confidential
information will be required by applicable Law to be disclosed in the Proxy
Statement.

 \t\t

9.6 Registration Statement. Within 30 days from the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall file a resale registration statement on Form S-3 (or to the
extent not available, on Form S-1) with respect to (a) the Closing Payment
Shares; (b) the Purchaser Warrants (including any shares of Purchaser Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Purchaser Warrants) and (c) the Purchaser
Common Stock held by Sponsor.

 \t\t

9.7 Indemnification; Insurance.

 \t\t

(a) From and after the Closing Date and for a period of six years thereafter,
the Purchaser shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations pursuant
to any indemnification agreements between the Purchaser or the Company Group,
on the one hand, and any current or former directors, officers and employees,
as the case may be, of the Purchaser, the Company Group, on the other hand, in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and any indemnification
provisions under the Purchaser Charter Documents, Company Charter Documents or
the comparable charter or organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries
as in effect on the date hereof, in each case to the maximum extent permitted
by Law, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provision in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights of such indemnitee
thereunder for any acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date.

 \t\t

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall enter into a directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy covering the current and former
directors, officers and employees, as the case may be, of the Company (the
"Insured Parties") on customary terms that are no less favorable to the
Insured Parties than those of any present directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company covering the Insured Parties (such
policy, a "Company DandO Policy"), for a period of seven years after the Closing
Date. All costs and expenses related to the Company DandO Policy, including the
insurance premiums, shall be paid by the Company.

 \t\t

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 9.7 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on the Purchaser,
the Company Group and all successors and assignees of the Purchaser and the
Company Group. In the event that the Purchaser or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person, the Purchaser shall cause proper
provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 9.7.

 \t\t

(d) The obligations of the Purchaser and the Company under this Section 9.7

Article XII 
TERMINATION

 \t\t

12.1 Termination Without Default.

 \t\t

(a) In the event that the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereunder
has not occurred by January 31, 2020 (the "Outside Closing Date"), the
Purchaser or the Company shall have the right, at its sole option, to
terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that a party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1(a) if the
failure of the Closing to occur prior to the Outside Closing Date is
attributable to the failure on the part of such party to perform in any
material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be
performed by such party. Such right may be exercised by the Purchaser or the
Company, as the case may be, giving written notice to the other at any time
after the Outside Closing Date.

 \t\t

  \t\t

40

    \t

 \t\t

(b) In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction or other Authority
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other
action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which order,
decree, ruling or other action shall be final and nonappealable, the Purchaser
or the Company shall have the right, at its sole option, to terminate this
Agreement; provided, however, that a party shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.1(b) if such action by such court
or Authority is attributable to the failure on the part of such party to
perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement
required to be performed by such party.

 \t\t

(c) In the event that the Purchaser fails to receive the Purchaser Stockholder
Approval at the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting (subject to any adjournment or

the Company shall have the right, at its sole option, to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to the other party; provided that the Purchaser
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

(d) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Company.

 \t\t

by giving written notice to the Company, without prejudice to any rights or
obligations the Purchaser may have, if the Company or the Stockholders shall
have materially breached any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained herein to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, which would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 10.2(a) or Section
10.2(b) to be satisfied and cannot be cured by the earlier of the Outside
Closing Date and thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company or the
Stockholders' Representative, as the case may be, of a written notice
describing in reasonable detail the nature of such breach; provided, however,
that, the Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 12.2(a) if the Purchaser is then in material breach
of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant hereunder.

 \t\t

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date
by giving written notice to the Purchaser, without prejudice to any rights or
obligations the Company may have, if the Purchaser shall have materially
breached any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained herein
to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, which would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Section 10.3(a) to be satisfied and cannot
be cured by the earlier of the Outside Closing Date and thirty (30) days
following receipt by the Purchaser of a written notice describing in
reasonable detail the nature of such breach; provided, however, that, the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 12.2(b) if the Company is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant hereunder.

 \t\t

12.3 Termination for Triggering Event. Either the Purchaser or the Company
may, by written notice to the other party, terminate this Agreement on or
prior to the Closing Date, without prejudice to any rights or obligations of
such party, if a Triggering Event with respect to the other party shall have

13.2 Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies.

 \t\t

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each
party, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No provision
hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party against whom
such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply only in the
particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given.

 \t\t

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of dealing
shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any right or
remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to or demand
on a party waives or otherwise affects any obligation of that party or impairs
any right of the party giving such notice or making such demand, including any
right to take any action without notice or demand not otherwise required by
this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with respect to a breach of
this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other right or remedy, as
appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with respect to such breach, or
subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with respect to any other breach.

 \t\t

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement herein of any
right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated herein or that
otherwise may be available.

 \t\t

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither shall any party
seek, nor shall any party be liable for, diminution in value, punitive,
consequential, special, indirect, or exemplary damages, under any tort,
contract, equity, or other legal theory, with respect to any breach (or
alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any matter
otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith.

 \t\t

13.3 Arm's length bargaining; no presumption against drafter. This Agreement
has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal bargaining strength,
each represented by counsel or having had but declined the opportunity to be
represented by counsel and having participated in the drafting of this
Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other special relationship
between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise exists. No presumption
in favor of or against any party in the construction or interpretation of this
Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made based upon which Person might
have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

 \t\t

13.4 Publicity. The parties agree that neither they nor their agents shall
issue any press release or make any other public disclosure concerning the
transactions contemplated hereunder without the prior approval of the other
party hereto (which, for clarity, shall in the case of the Company be from the
Purchaser and in the case of the Purchaser be from the Company). If a party is
required to make such a disclosure as required by law, the parties will use
their best efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or public disclosure
to be issued. Notwithstanding

 \t\t

  \t\t

43

    \t

 \t\t

the foregoing: (a) each party may, without such consultation or consent, make
any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements
to employees and make disclosures in Purchaser SEC Documents, so long as such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by
the other party); (b) a party may, without the prior consent of the other
party hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other party, issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as
may be required by any Law.

 \t\t

13.5 Expenses. The costs and expenses incurred by the Company, the Purchaser
and HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. (provided that for HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd.,
reasonable costs and expenses incurred of only up to an amount of $30,000) in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any Transaction Expenses, shall be paid by the Purchaser at the
Closing; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that if the Closing does not
take place, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 \t\t

13.6 No Assignment or Delegation. No party may assign any right or delegate
any obligation hereunder, including by merger, consolidation, operation of
law, or otherwise, without the written consent of the other party (which, for
clarity, shall in the case of the Company be from the Purchaser and in the
case of the Purchaser be from the Company). Any purported assignment or
delegation without such consent shall be void, in addition to constituting a
material breach of this Agreement.

 \t\t

13.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the
conflict of laws principles thereof, except that all matters relating to the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board shall be subject to the laws of Bermuda.

 \t\t

13.8 Counterparts; facsimile signatures. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon
delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the earlier delivery to
each party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted signature
pages that together (but need not individually) bear the signatures of all
other parties.

 \t\t

13.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement together with the Additional Agreements,
sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
understandings and agreements related thereto (whether written or oral), all
of which are merged herein. No provision of this Agreement or any Additional
Agreement may be explained or qualified by any agreement, negotiations,
understanding, discussion, conduct or course of conduct or by any trade usage.
Except as otherwise expressly stated herein or any Additional Agreement, there
is no condition precedent to the effectiveness of any provision hereof or
thereof. No party has relied on any representation from, or warranty or
agreement of, any person in entering into this Agreement, prior hereto or
contemporaneous herewith or any Additional Agreement, except those expressly
stated herein or therein.

 \t\t

13.10 Severability. A determination by a court or other legal authority that
any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is legally invalid
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof.
The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or cause such court
or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so held to be
invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid provision as
is lawful.

 \t\t

13.11 Construction of certain terms and references; captions. In this
Agreement:

 \t\t

(a) References to particular sections and subsections, schedules, and exhibits
not otherwise specified are cross-references to sections and subsections,
schedules, and exhibits of this Agreement.

 \t\t

action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or notice is required
to be given on or before a particular day which is not a Business Day, such
action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken or given on or

after reasonable inquiry, and as such term is used with respect to the
Company, it shall mean such knowledge of Pete Salzmann, Sandeep Kulkarni and
Brad Middlekauff (each, a "Key Company Employee"). With respect to matters
involving Intellectual Property Rights, knowledge does not require that any of
such entity's executive officers conduct or have conducted or obtain or have
obtained any freedom-to-operate opinions or similar opinions of counsel or any
intellectual property clearance searches, and no knowledge of any third party
intellectual property that would have been revealed by such inquiries,
opinions or searches will be imputed to such executive officers.

 \t\t

13.12 Further Assurances. Each party shall execute and deliver such documents
and take such action, as may reasonably be considered within the scope of such
party's obligations hereunder, necessary to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 \t\t

13.13 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 9.7 and Section
13.16, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof confers any benefit or
right upon or may be enforced by any Person not a signatory hereto.

 \t\t

13.14 Waiver. Reference is made to the final prospectus of the Purchaser,
dated May 9, 2019 (the "Prospectus"). Each of the Company and the
Stockholders' Representative, for itself and on behalf of the Stockholders,
has read the Prospectus and understands that the Purchaser has established the
Trust Account for the benefit of the public stockholders of the Purchaser and
the underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement and that, except
for a portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account,
the Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account only for the purposes
set forth in the Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of the Purchaser
agreeing to enter into this Agreement, each of the Company and the
Stockholders' Representative, for itself and on behalf of the Stockholders,
hereby agrees that it does not have any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and hereby agrees that it will
not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any claim it may have in the
future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing
herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's or the Stockholders'
Representative's right to pursue a claim against the Purchaser for legal
relief against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for
specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to
Section 13.18 hereof (including a claim for Purchaser to specifically perform
its obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance
of the cash remaining in the Trust Account after giving effect to the
redemption of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to the Redemptions in connection
with the Closing) to the Stockholders in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Trust Agreement, or for fraud and (y) nothing herein shall
serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company and the Stockholders'
Representative may have in the future against the Purchaser's assets or funds
that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been
released from the Trust Account to the Purchaser and any assets that have been
purchased or acquired with any such funds). This Section 13.14 shall survive
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

13.15 Stockholders' Representative. Roivant Sciences Ltd., is hereby appointed
as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholders' Representative") for each
Stockholder, (a) to give and receive notices and communications to Purchaser
for any purpose under this Agreement and the Additional Agreements, (b) to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators under
Section 11.1 or other disputes arising under or related to this Agreement, (c)
to act on behalf of Stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the
Agreement, the securities described herein and any other document or
instrument executed in connection with the Agreement and the Share Exchange
and (d) to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing; provided
that for (a), (b), (c) and (d) as applied to HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd
("HanAll"), only with respect to the matters or as set forth in Schedule
13.15. The Stockholders' Representative shall provide HanAll with timely
notice prior to taking any of the actions set forth in the preceding sentence
on behalf of HanAll. Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time
to time upon no less than twenty (20) days prior written notice to the
Purchaser, provided, however, that the Stockholders' Representative may not be
removed unless holders of at least 51% of all of the Company Common Shares on
an as-if converted basis outstanding immediately prior to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement agree to such removal. Any vacancy in the
position of Stockholders' Representative may be filled by approval of the
holders of at least 51% of all of the Company Common Shares on an as-if
converted basis outstanding immediately prior to the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement. Any removal or change of the Stockholders' Representative
shall not be effective until written notice is delivered to Purchaser. No bond
shall be required of the Stockholders' Representative, and the Stockholders'
Representative shall not receive any compensation for his services. Notices or
communications to or from the Stockholders' Representative shall constitute
notice to or from the Stockholders. The Stockholders' Representative shall not
be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder while acting in good faith and
in the exercise of reasonable business judgment. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders' Representative shall, for all purposes
hereunder, constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all of the
Stockholders of the Company and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of the Stockholders. The Stockholders shall severally indemnify the
Stockholders' Representative and hold him harmless against any loss,
liability, or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Stockholders' Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder.

 \t\t

13.16 Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that this Agreement may
only be enforced against, and any action for breach of this Agreement may only
be made against, the parties to this Agreement, and no Non-Recourse Party of a
party to this Agreement shall have any liability relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated herein, except with respect to common law
fraud against the person who committed such common law fraud.

 \t\t

13.17 Acknowledgement by Purchaser.

 \t\t

(a) Purchaser is not relying and Purchaser has not relied on any
representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, express or implied, except for the representations and warranties
in Article IV and Article VI, including the Disclosure Schedule. Such
representations and warranties by the Company Group and the Stockholders
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Company Group and the Stockholders in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and Purchaser understands, acknowledges and
agrees that all other representations and warranties of any kind or nature
whether express, implied or statutory are specifically disclaimed by the
Company Group and Stockholders.

 \t\t

(b) In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company Group by
Purchaser and its respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives or advisors, Purchaser and its Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and
advisors have received and may continue to receive after the date hereof from
the Company Group and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company Group and
their businesses and operations and regarding its Affiliate. Purchaser hereby
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, and that Purchaser will have no claim against
the Company Group, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives or
advisors, or any other person with respect thereto unless any such information
is expressly

 \t\t

  \t\t

46

    \t

 \t\t

addressed or included in a representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement. Accordingly, Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither
the Company Group nor any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives or
advisors, nor any other person, has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans unless any such
information is expressly addressed or included in a representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement.

 \t\t

13.18 Specific Performance. Each party acknowledges that the rights of each
party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique,
recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
party, money damages would be inadequate and the non-breaching parties would
not have adequate remedy at law, and agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
by an applicable party in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each party shall be entitled to an injunction
or restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the requirement
to post any bond or other security or to prove that money damages would be
inadequate, this being in addition to any other right or remedy to which such
party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity.

 \t\t

13.19 Acknowledgement; Waiver of Conflicts; Retention of Privilege.

 \t\t

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that Cooley LLP ("Prior
Company Counsel") has acted as counsel to the Company in various matters
involving a range of issues and as counsel to the Company in connection with
the negotiation of this Agreement and the Additional Agreements, and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 \t\t

(b) In connection with any matter or dispute under this Agreement, Purchaser
hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agree to cause the
Company Group after the Closing to irrevocably waive and agree not to asset,
any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) Prior Company
Counsel's prior representation of the Company and (ii) Prior Company Counsel's
representation of the Stockholders' Representative and/or any member of the
Company Group (collectively, the "Advised Parties") prior to and after the
Closing.

 \t\t

(c) Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company Group, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of Prior Company Counsel, the Company, any of
the Advised Parties, or any of their respective Representatives that relate in
any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or, beginning on the date of this Agreement,
any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the "Deal
Communications") shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively by the
Advised Parties, shall be controlled by the Stockholders' Representative on
behalf of the Company and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the
Company Group after the Closing. All Deal Communications that are attorney-
client privileged (the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain
privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Stockholders'
Representative and the Company, shall be controlled by the Stockholders'
Representative on behalf of the Company and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Purchaser or the Company Group after the Closing; provided, further, that
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company Group and its
Affiliates) of any applicable privileges or protections that can or may be
asserted to prevent disclosure of any such communications to any third party.

 \t\t

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchaser or the Company Group, on the one hand, and a third party other than
the Stockholders' Representative or the Company, on the other hand, Purchaser
or the Company Group may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;
provided, however, that neither Purchaser or the Company Group may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholders'
Representative. In the event that Purchaser or the Company Group is legally
required by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all
or a portion of the Privileged Deal Communications, Purchaser shall
immediately (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the
Stockholders' Representative in writing (including by making specific
reference to this Section 13.19) so that the Stockholders' Representative can
seek a protective order and Purchaser agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

 \t\t

  \t\t

47

    \t

 \t\t

(e) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Prior Company
Counsel constitute property of its clients, only the Stockholders'
Representative shall hold such property rights and Prior Company Counsel shall
have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or any
Privileged Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand, and the Company Group after
the Closing, on the other hand so long as such files or other materials would
be subject to a privilege or protection if they were being requested in a
proceeding by an unrelated third party.

 \t\t

(f) Purchaser agrees on behalf of itself and the Company Group after the
Closing, (i) to the extent that Purchaser or, after the Closing, the Company
Group receives or takes physical possession of any Deal Communications, (a)
such physical possession or receipt shall not, in any way, be deemed a waiver
by any of the Advised Parties or any other Person, of the privileges or
protections described in this section, and (b) neither Purchaser nor the
Company Group after the Closing shall assert any claim that any of the Advised
Parties or any other Person waived the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product protection or any other right or expectation of client confidence
applicable to any such materials or communications, (ii) not to access or use
the Deal Communications, including by way of review of any electronic data,
communications or other information, or by seeking to have the Stockholders'
Representative or the Company waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or
by otherwise asserting that Purchaser or the Company Group after the Closing
has the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege and (iii) not to
seek to obtain the Deal Communications from Prior Company Counsel so long as
such Deal Communications would be subject to a privilege or protection if they
were being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third party.

 \t\t

13.20 No Survival. The parties hereto, intending to modify any applicable
statute of limitations, agree that (a) other than for the sole purpose of
recovery under RandW Insurance Policy, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall
terminate effective as of the Closing and shall not survive the Closing for
any purpose, and thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of, nor
shall any claim be made by, any party or any of their respective Affiliates in
respect thereof, and (b) after the Closing, there shall be no liability on the
part of, nor shall any claim be made by, any party or any of their respective
Affiliates in respect of any covenant or agreement to be performed prior to
the Closing.

 \t\t

LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

 \t\t

THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated as of September 29, 2019,
by and between the undersigned (the "Holder") and Health Sciences Acquisitions
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Health Sciences"). Capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms
in the Share Exchange Agreement (as defined below).

 \t\t

BACKGROUND

 \t\t

A. Health Sciences has entered into that certain Share Exchange Agreement,
dated as of September 29, 2019 (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), by and among
Health Sciences, Immunovant Sciences Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited company
("Immunovant"), the stockholders of Immunovant (each, a "Stockholder" and,
collectively, the "Stockholders"), and Roivant Sciences Ltd., a Bermuda
exempted limited company.

 \t\t

B. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Health Sciences shall purchase
100% of Immunovant's outstanding common shares from the Stockholders (the
"Transaction"). As consideration for the Transaction, Health Sciences will
issue shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "HS
Shares"), to the Stockholders.

 \t\t

C. The Holder is the record and/or beneficial owner of common shares of
Immunovant and is therefore entitled to receive HS Shares pursuant to the
Share Exchange Agreement.

 \t\t

D. As a condition of, and as a material inducement for Health Sciences to
enter into and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange
Agreement, the Holder has agreed to execute and deliver this Agreement.

 \t\t

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 \t\t

AGREEMENT

 \t\t

1. Lock-Up

 \t\t

(a) During the Lock-up Period (as defined below), the Holder irrevocably
agrees that it, he or she will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the Lock-up Shares (as
defined below), enter into a transaction that would have the same effect, or
enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in
part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such Lock-up Shares,
whether any of these transactions are to be settled by delivery of any such
Lock-up Shares, in cash or otherwise, publicly disclose the intention to make
any offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to enter into any transaction,
swap, hedge or other arrangement, or engage in any Short Sales (as defined
below) with respect to any security of Health Sciences.

 \t\t

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, Health Sciences will (i) place an
irrevocable stop order on all Lock-up Shares, including those which may be
covered by a registration statement, and (ii) notify Health Sciences' transfer
agent in writing of the stop order and the restrictions on such Lock-up Shares
under this Agreement and direct Health Sciences' transfer agent not to process
any attempts by the Holder to resell or transfer any Lock-up Shares, except in
compliance with this Agreement.

 \t\t

(c) For purposes hereof, "Short Sales" include, without limitation, all "short
sales" as defined in Rule 200 promulgated under Regulation SHO under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and all
types of direct and indirect stock pledges, forward sale contracts, options,
puts, calls, swaps and similar arrangements (including on a total return
basis), and sales and other transactions through non-US broker dealers or
foreign regulated brokers.

 \t\t

(d) For purpose of this Agreement, the "Lock-up Period" means: (i) with
respect to 50% of the Lock-up Shares, the shorter of (A) the period commencing
on the Closing Date (as defined in the Share Exchange

 \t\t

  \t\t

51

    \t

 \t\t

Agreement) and ending on the date that is six (6) months thereafter; and (B)
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date on which the
last reported closing price of the HS Shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market (or
such other exchange on which the HS Shares are then listed) equals or exceeds
$12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days during any 30
trading day period thereafter; and (ii) with respect to the remaining 50% of
the Lock-up Shares, the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on
the date that is six (6) months thereafter.

 \t\t

The restrictions set forth herein shall not apply to: (1) transfers or
distributions to the Holder's current or former general or limited partners,
managers or members, stockholders, other equityholders or direct or indirect
affiliates (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended) or to the estates of any of the foregoing; (2) transfers by bona
fide gift to a member of the Holder's immediate family or to a trust, the
beneficiary of which is the Holder or a member of the Holder's immediate
family for estate planning purposes; (3) by virtue of the laws of descent and
distribution upon death of the Holder; or (4) pursuant to a qualified domestic
relations order, in each case where such transferee agrees to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement.

 \t\t

In addition, if within six (6) months after the Closing Date, there is a
Change of Control (as defined in the Share Exchange Agreement), then upon the
consummation of such Change of Control, all Lock-up Shares shall be released
from the restrictions contained herein.

 \t\t

2. Representations and Warranties.

The Holder has independently evaluated the merits of its decision to enter into and deliver this Agreement, and such Holder confirms that it has not relied on the advice of Health Sciences, Health Sciences' legal counsel, Immunovant or its legal counsel, or any other person.

 \t\t

3. Beneficial Ownership. The Holder hereby represents and warrants that it does not beneficially own, directly or through its nominees (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), any shares of capital stock of Health Sciences, or any economic interest in or derivative of such stock, other than those HS Shares specified on the signature page hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, the HS Shares beneficially owned by the Holder on the Closing Date, together with any HS Shares acquired during the Lock-up Period, and including any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or representing the rights to receive HS Shares, if any, are collectively referred to as the "Lock-up Shares."

majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities held by the Investors or
their affiliates, or the transferees of the Investors, (ii) the Sponsor or its

Registration"). Any demand for a Demand Registration shall specify the number
of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will notify all holders of
Registrable Securities of the demand, and each holder of Registrable
Securities who wishes to include all or a portion of such holder's Registrable
Securities in the Demand Registration (each such holder including shares of
Registrable Securities in such registration, a "Demanding Holder") shall so
notify the Company within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the holder of
the

 \t\t

  \t\t

57

    \t

 \t\t

notice from the Company. Upon any such request, the Demanding Holders shall be
entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in the Demand
Registration, subject to Section 2.1.4 and the provisos set forth in Section
3.1.1. The Company shall not be obligated to effect more than an aggregate of
two (2) Demand Registrations under this Section 2.1.1 in respect of all
Registrable Securities. For the avoidance of doubt, each of (a) the holders of
a majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities held by the Investors,
(b) the Sponsor and (c) Roivant Sciences Ltd. are permitted to exercise a
Demand Registration pursuant to this Section 2.1.1 with respect to their
respective Registrable Securities.

 \t\t

2.1.2 Effective Registration. A registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and the
Company has complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with
respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such Registration Statement
has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant
to a Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or injunction of
the Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the Registration
Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed not to have
been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction
is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest
of the Demanding Holders thereafter elect to continue the offering; provided,
further, that the Company shall not be obligated to file a second Registration
Statement until a Registration Statement that has been filed is counted as a
Demand Registration or is terminated.

 \t\t

2.1.3 Underwritten Offering. If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders so elect and such holders so advise the Company as part of their
written demand for a Demand Registration, the offering of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the form of an
underwritten offering. In such event, the right of any holder to include its
Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such
holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's
Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All
Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through
such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form
with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such underwriting by a
majority-in-interest of the holders initiating the Demand Registration.

 \t\t

2.1.4 Reduction of Offering. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters for a
Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises the Company
and the Demanding Holders in writing that the dollar amount or number of
shares of Registrable Securities which the Demanding Holders desire to sell,
taken together with all other shares of Common Stock or other securities which
the Company desires to sell and the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to
which registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-
back registration rights held by other shareholders of the Company who desire
to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares that
can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering
price, the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of
such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares, as
applicable, the "Maximum Number of Shares"), then the Company shall include in
such registration: (i) first, the Registrable Securities as to which Demand
Registration has been requested by the Demanding Holders (pro rata in
accordance with the number of shares that each such Person has requested be
included in such registration, regardless of the number of shares held by each
such Person (such proportion is referred to herein as "Pro Rata")) that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (ii) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (i), the shares of Common Stock or other securities that the
Company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Shares; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares
has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the shares of
Common Stock or other securities for the account of other persons that the
Company is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual arrangements
with such persons and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares.

 \t\t

2.1.5 Withdrawal. If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
disapprove of the terms of any underwriting or are not entitled to include all
of their Registrable Securities in any offering, such majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders may elect to withdraw from such offering by giving
written notice to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of their
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement

 \t\t

  \t\t

58

    \t

 \t\t

filed with the Commission with respect to such Demand Registration. If the
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders withdraws from a proposed
offering relating to a Demand Registration, then such registration shall not
count as a Demand Registration provided for in Section 2.1.

 \t\t

2.2 Piggy-Back Registration.

 \t\t

2.2.1 Piggy-Back Rights. If, at any time on or after the Closing Date of the
Business Combination, the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement
under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or
securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into, equity securities, by the Company for its own account or for
shareholders of the Company for their account (or by the Company and by
shareholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to Section
2.1), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any
employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or
offering of securities solely to the Company's existing shareholders, (iii)
for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the
Company or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company shall (x)
give written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable
Securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days
before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the amount and
type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of
distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the holders of
Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to Register the sale of
such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders may request in
writing within five (5) days following receipt of such notice (a "Piggy-Back
Registration"). The Company shall cause such Registrable Securities to be
included in such registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a Piggy-Back
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the
Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to distribute their securities
through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves an Underwriter or Underwriters
shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such Piggy-Back Registration.

 \t\t

2.2.2 Reduction of Offering. If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters for a
Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises the
Company and the holders of Registrable Securities in writing that the dollar
amount or number of shares of Common Stock which the Company desires to sell,
taken together with the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which
Registration has been demanded pursuant to written contractual arrangements
with persons other than the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder, the
Registrable Securities as to which Registration has been requested under this
Section 2.2, and the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration
has been requested pursuant to the written contractual piggy-back Registration
rights of other shareholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of
Shares, then the Company shall include in any such Registration:

 \t\t

(a) If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account: (A) first,
the shares of Common Stock or other securities that the Company desires to
sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (B)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (A), the shares of Common Stock or other
securities, if any, comprised of Registrable Securities, as to which
Registration has been requested pursuant to the applicable written contractual
piggy-back registration rights of such security holders, Pro Rata, that can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; and (C) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the shares of Common Stock or other securities
for the account of other persons that the Company is obligated to Register
pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights with such
persons and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares;

 \t\t

(b) If the registration is a "demand" registration undertaken at the demand of
persons other than either the holders of Registrable Securities, (A) first,
the shares of Common Stock or other securities for the account of the
demanding persons that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the shares of Common Stock or
other securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum

 \t\t

  \t\t

59

    \t

 \t\t

Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),
collectively the shares of Common Stock or other securities comprised of
Registrable Securities, Pro Rata, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to the terms hereof, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the
shares of Common Stock or other securities for the account of other persons
that the Company is obligated to Register pursuant to written contractual
arrangements with such persons, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares.

 \t\t

2.2.3 Withdrawal. Any holder of Registrable Securities may elect to withdraw
such holder's request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any Piggy-
Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such request to
withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Company
(whether on its own determination or as the result of a withdrawal by persons
making a demand pursuant to written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the Company shall
pay all expenses incurred by the holders of Registrable Securities in
connection with such Piggy-Back Registration as provided in Section 3.3.

 \t\t

2.2.4 Unlimited Piggy-Back Registration Rights. For purposes of clarity, any
Registration effected pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof shall not be counted as a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under Section 2.1
hereof.

 \t\t

2.3 Registrations on Form S-3. At any time and from time to time on or after
the Closing Date of the Business Combination the holders of a majority-in-
interest of the Registrable Securities held by the Investors or their
affiliates, or the transferees of the Investors may request in writing that
the Company register the resale of any or all of such Registrable Securities
on Form S-3 or any similar short-form registration which may be available at
such time ("Form S-3"); provided, however, that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect such request through an underwritten offering. Upon
receipt of such written request, the Company will promptly give written notice
of the proposed registration to all other holders of Registrable Securities,
and, as soon as practicable thereafter, effect the registration of all or such
portion of such holder's or holders' Registrable Securities as are specified
in such request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable
Securities or other securities of the Company, if any, of any other holder or
holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request given
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice from the
Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect
any such registration pursuant to this Section 2.3: (i) if Form S-3 is not
available for such offering; or (ii) if the holders of the Registrable
Securities, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company
entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable
Securities and such other securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the
public of less than $500,000. Registrations effected pursuant to this Section
2.3 shall not be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to Section
2.1.

 \t\t

2.4 Mandatory Registration. Promptly following the Closing Date of the
Business Combination, the Company shall file with the Commission a resale
Registration Statement on any form for which the Company then qualifies or
which counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate and which form shall be
available for the registration under the Securities Act and sale, of all of
the Registrable Securities held by the Investors that are Immunovant
Stockholders. The Company shall cause the same to become effective and to
maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement until the earlier of
(i) the date that all of the securities registered thereunder have been sold
by such Investors or (ii) the date such securities are freely saleable under
Rule 144 under the Securities Act without volume limitations.

 \t\t

3\. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

3.1 Filings; Information. Whenever the Company is required to effect the
Registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2, the Company

distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with
any such request:

 \t\t

3.1.1 Filing Registration Statement. The Company shall use its best efforts
to, as expeditiously as possible after receipt of a request for a Demand

  \t\t

60

    \t

 \t\t

efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and use its
best efforts to keep it effective for the period required by Section 3.1.3;
provided, however, that the Company shall have the right to defer any Demand
Registration for up to thirty (30) days, and any Piggy-Back Registration for
such period as may be applicable to deferment of any Demand Registration to
which such Piggy-Back Registration relates, in each case if the Company shall
furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or
Chairman of the Company stating that, in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Company, it would be materially detrimental to the Company
and its shareholders for such Registration Statement to be effected at such
time; provided further, however, that the Company shall not have the right to
exercise the right set forth in the immediately preceding proviso more than
once in any 365-day period in respect of a Demand Registration hereunder.

 \t\t

3.1.2 Copies. The Company shall, prior to filing a Registration Statement or
prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to

Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and

all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such Registration
Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or such securities have
been withdrawn.

 \t\t

3.1.4 Notification. After the filing of a Registration Statement, the Company
shall promptly, and in no event more than two (2) business days after such
filing, notify the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement of such filing, and shall further notify such holders

amendment to such Registration Statement becomes effective; (iii) the issuance
or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order (and the Company
shall take all actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to
remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by the Commission for any
amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or any prospectus
relating thereto or for additional information or of the occurrence of an
event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and promptly make available to the holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement any such supplement or
amendment; except that, before filing with the Commission a Registration
Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, including
documents incorporated by reference, the Company shall furnish, to the holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement and to the
legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such documents proposed to
be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide such holders and legal
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such documents and comment

prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, including documents
incorporated by reference, to which such holders or their legal counsel shall
object.

 \t\t

3.1.5 State Securities Laws Compliance. The Company shall use its best efforts
to (i) Register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement (in light of their intended plan of
distribution) may request and (ii) take such action necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be Registered
with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may be necessary by
virtue of the business and operations of the Company and do any and all other
acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally
to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to
qualify but for this paragraph or subject itself to taxation in any such
jurisdiction.

 \t\t

  \t\t

61

    \t

 \t\t

3.1.6 Agreements for Disposition. The Company shall enter into customary
agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement in customary
form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities. The
representations, warranties and covenants of the Company in any underwriting
agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any Underwriters, to the
extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the benefit of the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement. No holder of
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement shall be
required to make any representations or warranties in the underwriting

hereunder, which cooperation shall include, without limitation, the
preparation of the Registration Statement with respect to such offering and
all other offering materials and related documents, and participation in
meetings with Underwriters, attorneys, accountants and potential investors.

 \t\t

3.1.8 Records. The Company shall make available, for inspection by the holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement, any
Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration
statement and any attorney, accountant or other professional retained by any

of counsel to the Company to the effect that the Registration Statement
containing such prospectus has been declared effective and that no stop order
is in effect.

 \t\t

3.1.11 Listing. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities included in any registration to be listed on such

the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such
registration.

 \t\t

3.1.12 Road Show. If the Registration involves the registration of Registrable
Securities involving gross proceeds in excess of $25,000,000, the Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the

Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section

Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable

special experts retained by the Company in connection with such registration;

selling commissions shall be borne by such holders. Additionally, in an
underwritten offering, all selling shareholders and the Company shall bear the
expenses of the Underwriter pro rata in proportion to the respective amount of
shares each is selling in such offering.

 \t\t

3.4 Information. The holders of Registrable Securities shall provide such
information as may reasonably be requested by the Company, or the managing
Underwriter, if any, in connection with the preparation of any Registration

pursuant to Section 2 and in connection with the Company's obligation to
comply with federal and applicable state securities laws.

 \t\t

4\. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

 \t\t

4.1 Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities, and
each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors, partners,
members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any, who controls an
Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) (each,
an "Investor Indemnified Party"), from and against any expenses, losses,
judgments, claims, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several, arising
out of or based upon any untrue statement (or allegedly untrue statement) of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of
such Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon any omission (or
alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by
the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction
required of the Company in connection with any such registration; and the
Company shall promptly reimburse the Investor Indemnified Party for any legal
and any other expenses reasonably incurred by such Investor Indemnified Party
in connection with investigating and defending any such expense, loss,
judgment, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the
Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any
untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus,
or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to the Company, in writing, by
such selling holder expressly for use therein. The Company also shall
indemnify any Underwriter of the Registrable Securities, their officers,
affiliates, directors, partners, members and agents and each person who
controls such Underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification provided above in this Section 4.1.

 \t\t

  \t\t

63

    \t

 \t\t

4.2 Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities. Each selling holder
of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any registration is being
effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement of any
Registrable Securities held by such selling holder, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers and each Underwriter
(if any), and each other selling holder and each other person, if any, who
controls another selling holder or such Underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act, against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities,
whether joint or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages
or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of such
Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or the alleged
omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statement therein not misleading, if the statement or omission was
made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing
to the Company by such selling holder expressly for use therein, and shall
reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, and each other selling
holder or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by any of them in connection with investigation or defending any such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Each selling holder's
indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint and shall
be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received by such selling
holder.

 \t\t

4.3 Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Promptly after receipt by any
person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, such
person (the "Indemnified Party") shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against any other person for indemnification hereunder, notify such other
person (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the loss, claim, judgment,
damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the failure by the
Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying Party may have to
such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and solely to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnified
Party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought
against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes,
jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control of the defense
thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
control of the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that
in any action in which both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
are named as defendants, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel) to represent the
Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be subject to liability
arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with the fees and expenses
of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party if, based upon the
written opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party, representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of judgment
or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and
indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless
such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding.

 \t\t

4.4 Contribution.

 \t\t

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing Sections 4.1, 4.2
and 4.3 is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any loss, claim,
damage, liability or action referred to herein, then each such Indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying
Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of any Indemnified Party and any
Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by such Indemnified Party or such Indemnifying Party and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission.

 \t\t

  \t\t

64

    \t

 \t\t

4.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 4.4 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding Section
4.4.1.

 \t\t

4.4.3 The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.4, no holder of Registrable
Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar

EXHIBIT C

 \t\t

Form of Sponsor Restricted Stock Agreement

 \t\t

RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT

 \t\t

This Restricted Stock Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
29th day of September, 2019, by and between Health Sciences Acquisitions
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Health Sciences
Holdings, LLC (the "Holder").

 \t\t

W I T N E S S E T H:

 \t\t

WHEREAS, in December 2018, the Holder purchased 2,875,000 shares (the
"Shares") of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock");

 \t\t

WHEREAS, the Shares are currently held in escrow pursuant to the terms of that
certain Stock Escrow Agreement, dated May 9, 2019 (the "Escrow Agreement"),
between the Company, the Holder and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, a New York corporation (the "Escrow Agent");

 \t\t

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company is
entering into that certain Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of September 29,
2019 (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), by and among the Company, Immunovant
Sciences Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited company ("Immunovant"), the
stockholders of Immunovant and Roivant Sciences Ltd., a Bermuda exempted
limited company, to effect the consummation of a business combination with
Immunovant (the "Business Combination"); and

 \t\t

WHEREAS, Holder is entering in to this Agreement as a condition of, and as a
material inducement for Immunovant to enter into and consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement.

 \t\t

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants
herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree
as follows:

 \t\t

1. Cancellation of Shares. Concurrently with the Closing (as defined in the Share Exchange Agreement) the Company shall instruct the Escrow Agent to cancel a number of Shares (the "Canceled Shares") equal to: (a) 1,800,000, multiplied by (b) (i) the number of shares of Common Stock validly redeemed by holders thereof in connection with the Business Combination as reflected in the records of the Company's transfer agent, divided by (ii) 11,500,000.

 \t\t

2. Share Restriction. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company shall instruct the Escrow Agent that a number of Shares (the "Restricted Shares") equal to 1,800,000 minus the number of Canceled Shares, shall be held in escrow and subject to potential forfeiture until vested in accordance with Section 4 below. 

 \t\t

3. Representations. The Company and the Holder hereby represent and warrant as follows:

 \t\t

a. Company Representations.

 \t\t

i) Authority; Due Execution. The Company has all requisite power and authority
and the legal capacity to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Company and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors' rights generally, and is
subject to general principles of equity.

 \t\t

ii) No Conflicts. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not (A)
conflict with or violate any law applicable to the Company of which the
Company is aware, or (B) result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance on
the Company's assets pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or any of
the Company's assets is bound or affected.

 \t\t

  \t\t

69

    \t

 \t\t

b. Holder Representations.

 \t\t

i) The Holder has all requisite power and authority and the legal capacity to
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Holder and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Holder, enforceable against the Holder in accordance
with its terms, except that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally, and is subject to general principles of equity.

 \t\t

ii) The Holder owns, of record and beneficially, and has good, valid and
indefeasible title to the Shares free and clear of any and all mortgages,
pledges, security interests, encumbrances, liens or charges of any kind,
except for those imposed on the Holder in connection with the Company's
initial public offering. Except for those agreements the Company is a party
to, there are no options, rights, voting trusts, stockholder agreements or any
other contracts or understandings to which the Holder is a party or by which
the Holder or the Shares are bound with respect to the issuance, sale,
transfer, voting or registration of the Shares.

 \t\t

4 Treatment of Restricted Shares.

 \t\t

a. Registration. The Restricted Shares shall remain in the name of the Holder
registered in book entry form at the Company's transfer agent. Unless and
until the Restricted Shares are forfeited as provided herein, Holder shall be
entitled to vote such shares. Any distributions of Common Stock declared with
respect to the Restricted Shares, including, but not limited to, shares of
Common Stock issued as a result of a stock dividend, stock split, combination
of shares or otherwise, shall be set aside and not paid until the Restricted
Shares have been vested and released to the Holder or, if the Restricted
Shares are not vested and released in accordance with this Agreement, then all
such distributions declared on such Restricted Shares shall be forfeited.

 \t\t

b. Nontransferability. Except as otherwise required by law, Restricted Shares
that have not vested in accordance with the terms of this Agreement may not be
sold, assigned, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of, except to the Company as provided herein.

 \t\t

c. Vesting. The Restricted Shares shall vest and no longer be subject to
forfeiture in accordance with the following schedule:

 \t\t

i) 50% of the Restricted Shares shall vest and no longer be subject to
forfeiture upon the date of final determination pursuant to Section 3.3(a) of
the Share Exchange Agreement that Milestone #1 has been achieved and the
applicable Earnout Shares (as defined therein) have become deliverable
thereunder; and

 \t\t

ii) 50% of the Restricted Shares shall vest and no longer be subject to
forfeiture upon the date of final determination pursuant to Section 3.3(a) of
the Share Exchange Agreement that Milestone #2 has been achieved and the
applicable Earnout Shares have become deliverable thereunder.

 \t\t

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to the vesting of all
Restricted Shares pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above, there is an
Acceleration Event (as defined in the Share Exchange Agreement), then all
Restricted Shares shall immediately vest in full and no longer be subject to
forfeiture upon the consummation of such Acceleration Event; provided that,
the Restricted Shares, if any, that remain subject to the vesting conditions
set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall not be deemed vested if the
value of the consideration to be received in exchange for each share of Common
Stock in the event of an Acceleration Event that is a Change of Control (as
defined in the Share Exchange Agreement) is lower than the applicable stock
price thresholds referenced thereby.

 \t\t

d. Delivery following Vesting. Upon the achievement of the vesting conditions
set forth above, the Company shall instruct the Escrow Agent to remove any
legend reflecting the limitation of transferability, the risk of forfeiture
and other restrictions under this Agreement from such vested Restricted
Shares, and such Shares will be eligible for release from escrow. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent then-applicable, such Shares will remain
subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 3 of the Escrow Agreement.

 \t\t

e. Cancellation of Unvested Restricted Shares. To the extent that all
Restricted Shares have not vested pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by
the date it is finally determined that the stockholders of Immunovant are not
entitled or eligible to receive any further Earnout Shares under the Share
Exchange Agreement, the Company and the Holder shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to cancel such Restricted Shares that have not then-vested.
