 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _ _Agreement__ "),
dated as of November **** 25, 2007, by and among The Genlyte Group
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the " _ _Company__ "), Philips Holding
USA Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _ _Parent__ "), and Golf Merger Sub, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (" _
_Merger Sub__ ").

  

 **RECITALS**

  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the " _ _Merger__ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; and

  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE 1

  



  

 _The Offer and the Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

        

1.1.

  |  

_The Offer_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) Subject to the conditions set forth on Exhibit 1, Merger Sub shall,
as promptly as practicable and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after the date hereof, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _ _Exchange Act__ ")) a
tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, par
value $0.01 per share of the Company, including, if any, the associated
preferred stock purchase rights (the " _ _Rights__ ," and together with the
shares of the Companys Common Stock, the " _ _Shares__ ") issued pursuant to
the Rights Agreement, dated as of September 13, 1999, between the Company
and the Bank of New York (the " _ _Rights Agreement__ "), at a price of
$95.50 per Share in cash, net to the seller but subject to any required
withholding of Taxes (such tender offer and price as they may from time to
time be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _ _Offer__ ," and the
" _ _Offer Price__ ," respectively). The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer and accept for payment, and
pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
conditions set forth in Exhibit 1. The initial expiration date of the Offer
shall be the later of (x) midnight (New York City time) on the date which is
20 Business Days from the date on which the Offer was commenced (determined as
provided in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) and (y) January 2, 2008
(the initial " _ _Expiration Date__ " and any expiration time and date
established pursuant to an extension of the Offer as so extended, also an " _
_Expiration Date__ "). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right (x) if the
Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in Exhibit 1) has not been satisfied or
if a Change of Recommendation has been made, to increase the Offer Price and
(y) to waive any condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer,
except that, without the prior

  
   



  

written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of
Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) modify, amend
or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in
Exhibit 1 or modify or amend any condition set forth in Exhibit 1 in any
manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (v) except as otherwise provided in
this Section 1.1(a), extend the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer or (vii) except as may be required by any Governmental
Entity, modify or amend the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to the
holders of the Shares. Merger Sub shall not, and Parent agrees that it shall
cause Merger Sub not to, terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in
connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may, in its
discretion, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Offer for one
or more consecutive increments of not more than ten Business Days each, if at
any otherwise scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer any of the conditions to
Merger Subs obligation to purchase Shares are not satisfied or waived, (ii)
extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _
_SEC__ ") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or (iii) make available
a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14d-11
(any extension pursuant to this sentence being a " _ _Parent Extension__ ").
In addition, (x) if at any otherwise scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer
any condition to the Offer is not satisfied or waived, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer at the request of the
Company for one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten Business
Days each until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms and May 23, 2008 (the " _ _Outside Date__ ") and (y) at any
time prior to the initial Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer at the request of the Company one time
for ten Business Days if the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal
prior to the initial Expiration Date that has not been withdrawn as of the
date of the request for the extension of the Offer by the Company; _provided_
, that nothing in clause (y) shall relieve the Company of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, including Section 6.2; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no request by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub to extend
the Offer pursuant to this sentence, in and of itself, shall be considered a
violation of Section 6.2. In addition, Merger Sub shall, if requested by the
Company, make available a subsequent offering period in accordance with
Exchange Act Rule 14d-11 of not less than ten Business Days; _provided_ , that
Merger Sub shall not be required to make available such a subsequent offering
period in the event that, prior to the commencement of such subsequent
offering period, Parent and Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, own more than
90% of the outstanding Shares. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, accept and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer, and,
in any event, in compliance with Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act (the date
of acceptance for payment for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer, the " _ _Purchase Date__ "). Without the prior written
consent of the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, and Merger Sub
shall not, accept for payment or pay for any Shares in the Offer if, as a
result, Merger Sub would acquire less than the number of Shares necessary to
satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition.

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Business Day__ " shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub
shall file with the SEC, pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act , a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase the
Shares and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _
_Offer Documents__ ") and shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the applicable federal
securities Laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
(collectively, the " _ _Securities Laws__ "). The Offer Documents shall comply
in all material respects with the Securities Laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company agrees to use all reasonable best efforts to respond promptly
to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or
the Offer and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information is or shall
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
the Securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as
so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver copies of the proposed
form of the Offer Documents to the Company, and the Company and its counsel
shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
(including any amendments or supplements thereto), in each case, within a
reasonable time before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the
holders of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall give the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any written or oral responses to such comments. Parent and Merger
Sub agree to use all reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
recommendations of the board of directors of the Company (the " _ _Company
Board__ ") described in Section 5.1(c)(ii), as such recommendations may be
amended and until such recommendations may be withdrawn, in each case as
permitted by this Agreement.

        

1.2.

  |  

_Company Actions_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) Subject to a Change of Recommendation, on the date the Offer
Documents are first filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer, which shall contain the Company Recommendation, as such
Company Recommendation may be amended (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _ _Schedule 14D-9__ "), and shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the holders of Shares with the
Offer Documents, in each case in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act and the Securities Laws. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply as to
form in all material respects with the Securities Laws. The Company shall
deliver copies of the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent, and
Parent and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on
the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or supplements thereto), in each
case, within a reasonable time before it is filed with the SEC or disseminated
to holders of

  



  

-3-

  
   



  

Shares. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use all reasonable
best efforts to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information is or shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
the Securities Laws. The Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended
or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written or oral
responses to such comments. The Company agrees to use all reasonable best
efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

  

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly after
execution of this Agreement furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub (i)
a list of the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the
most recent practicable date, as well as mailing labels containing such names
and addresses and (ii) security position lists, computer files and any other
information identifying the beneficial owners of Shares as of the most recent
practicable date which the Company or its transfer agent have in its
possession or control or can obtain without unreasonable effort or expense.
The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub such
additional information (including updates of the items provided pursuant to
the preceding sentence) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial owners of
Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _
_Transactions__ "), Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
will use such information only in connection with the Transactions and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request, deliver, and will use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company
all copies of such information then in their possession or control.

        

1.3.

  |  

_Company Directors_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, promptly upon the
purchase of, and payment for, any Shares by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer
which represent at least such number of Shares (determined on a fully diluted
basis) as shall satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition and at all times
thereafter, Merger Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate to the Company
Board such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, as is
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Merger Sub pursuant
to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the outstanding Shares
that are then beneficially owned by Merger Sub and its affiliates including
all Shares purchased in the Offer (but excluding Shares held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) bears to the number of Shares outstanding
(determined on a fully diluted basis). As used in this Agreement, the terms
"beneficial ownership" (and its correlative terms) and "affiliate" shall have
the meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 12b-2 under

  



  

-4-

  
   



  

the Exchange Act, respectively. Upon any exercise of such right by Merger Sub,
the Company shall use its best efforts to take all such actions as are
necessary to (i) elect or designate to the Company Board the individuals
designated by Merger Sub and permitted to be so elected or designated by the
preceding sentence, including but not limited to promptly filling vacancies or
newly created directorships on the Company Board, increasing the size of the
Company Board (including by amending the bylaws of the Company, if necessary,
so as to increase the size of the Company Board) and/or securing the
resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, and (ii) cause the
directors so elected or designated to constitute the same percentage (rounded
up to the next whole number) of the members of each committee of the Company
Board as such directors represent of the Company Board, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the rules of the Nasdaq Global
Market (" _ _Nasdaq__ "). The Companys obligations under this Section 1.3(a)
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this
Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with
the Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder as is necessary to enable Merger
Subs designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board. Merger Sub
shall supply on a timely basis the Company with, and be solely responsible
for, information and consents with respect to Merger Subs designees and
Parents and Merger Subs respective officers, directors and affiliates to
the extent required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition
to and shall not limit any rights that any of Merger Sub, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares
as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

  

(b) In the event that Merger Subs designees are elected or designated
to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the Effective
Time, the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (i)
the members of the Company Board on the date of this Agreement (the " _
_Existing Directors__ ") to remain as directors on the Company Board, (ii) the
Existing Directors to remain as members of the audit committee of the Company
Board and (iii) such audit committee to comply with all requirements of the
Securities Laws and Nasdaq applicable thereto (collectively, the " _ _Audit
Committee Requirements__ "). If any Existing Director is unable to serve due
to death, disability or resignation, the remaining Existing Director(s) (or,
if none of the Existing Directors are then in office, the members of the
Company Board) shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person (or
Persons) who, to the extent such person shall be a member of the audit
committee of the Company Board, will satisfy the Audit Committee Requirements
to fill such vacancy and each such Person shall be deemed to be an Existing
Director for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the Effective Time when Merger
Subs designees constitute a majority of the Company Board, Merger Sub shall
cause such designees not to (i) approve any amendment or termination by the
Company of, or any exercise, waiver or rescission by the Company of, any of
its rights under this Agreement or extend the time for performance of Parents
or Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, (ii) authorize any
amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company,
(iii) authorize any agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates (other than
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, that is not the

  



  

-5-

  
   



  

result of an arms-length negotiation between the respective parties, or (iv)
cease the Companys compliance with the continued listing requirements of
Nasdaq, in each case, unless such action is approved by a majority of the
Existing Directors.

        

1.4.

  |  

_The Top-Up Option_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the
" _ _Top-Up Option__ ") to purchase that number of Shares (the " _ _Top-Up
Option Shares__ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to
the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one Share more than
the number of Shares necessary for Merger Sub to be merged into the Company
pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _
_DGCL__ "), at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price ( a " _ _Short Form
Merger__ ").

  

(b) The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once in whole and not
in part within ten (10) Business Days after the Purchase Date; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary the
Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable and shall terminate on the Purchase
Date if (i) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares would require stockholder
approval under the rules of Nasdaq, (ii) the number of Top-Up Option Shares
would exceed the number of authorized but unissued Shares or (iii) after
issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, it will be insufficient to
allow Merger Sub to effect the Short Form Merger; and, provided, further, that
the Top-Up Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

(c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such
notice (i) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective affiliates immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares and (ii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Option Shares (the " _ _Top-Up Closing__ "). The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub in
writing of the number of Shares then outstanding and the number of Top-Up
Option Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares and the
Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the
Top-Up Option Shares.

  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Shares which Merger Sub
may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under
the Securities Laws and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger
Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon
the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined
in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that
the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Options Shares to be acquired upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

1.5. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__
"), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in the DGCL.

  

1.6. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall
take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New
York, New York, at 9:00 A.M. on the second Business Day (the " _ _Closing
Date__ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the

Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates_

  

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company:

  

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent,
Merger Sub, any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or
any affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub and Shares owned by the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case
not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by
stockholders (" _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ") who have perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
(each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and collectively, " _ _Excluded Shares__ ")
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Offer Price (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ "). At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") formerly
representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest.

  

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights that
Dissenting Stockholders who are holders thereof may have under Section 4.2(f).

  

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

        

4.2.

_Exchange of Certificates_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited to a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
(the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). The Paying Agent
agreement

  



  

-8-

  
   



  

pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within three Business Days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration for the number of Shares represented by such
Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with
the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may
be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash
amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this Article IV.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,

  



  

-9-

  
   



  

limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature.

  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required
by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by
such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder.
The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under
the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _ _Code__ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i)
shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

        

4.3.

  |  

_Treatment of Stock Plans_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding
option to purchase Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") under the Stock Plans,
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of
such Company Option to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days), an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Company
Option (without regard to any vesting provisions thereof) times (y) the
excess, if any, of the Per

  



  

-10-

  
   



  

Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such
Company Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment.

  

(b) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.3(a), including any
action to approve the disposition of the Company Options in connection with
the Transactions to the extent necessary to exempt such disposition under Rule
16b-3 of the Exchange Act. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
terminate the Stock Plans as of the Effective Time and to ensure that after
the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options.

  

(c) _Amounts Withheld_. To the extent that amounts are so withheld in
respect of Taxes by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, pursuant to Section 4.3(a), such withheld amounts (i) shall
be remitted by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  

(d) _Notice_. As soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company
Options a letter approved in advance by Parent describing the treatment of and
payment for such Company Options pursuant to this Section 4.3 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Options.

  

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Offer Price and the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

 _Representations and Warranties_

SEC on or prior to the date hereof (excluding, in each case, any forward-
looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section and in any section
included pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
except to the extent such disclosures in the risk factor sections or in the
sections included pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of

condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries)) or in the corresponding
sections or

subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior
to entering into this Agreement (the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ ") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall provide an exception to or otherwise qualify the
representations and warranties of the Company specifically referred to in such
disclosure and such other representations and warranties to the extent such
disclosure shall readily appear from the substance of such disclosure to be
applicable to such other representations and warranties), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly

the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets
or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys and its
Significant Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date hereof, and each
as so delivered is in full force and effect. Section 5.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each jurisdiction
where the Company and its Subsidiaries are organized and where the Company and
its U.S. Subsidiaries are qualified to do business.

  

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _ _Subsidiary__ " means, with
respect to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing
similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person
and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) " _ _Significant Subsidiary__
" is as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the
Exchange Act and (iii) " _ _Material Adverse Effect__ " means a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, assets, business or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided,
however, that none of the following, in and of itself or themselves, shall
constitute a Material Adverse Effect:

  

(A) changes in the U.S. or global economy or financial or capital
markets generally, including changes in interest rates and currency rates;

  

(B) changes that are the result of factors or conditions generally
affecting the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate;

  

(C) changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_ _GAAP__ ") or other accounting standards or changes in any Laws or
interpretations thereof, in each case, applicable to the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement;

  



  

-12-

  
   



  



  

(D) a decline in the price of Shares on Nasdaq, provided that the
exception in this clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination
that any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying such decline
has resulted in, or contributed to, a Material Adverse Effect;

  

(E) changes that are the result of acts of war, material armed
hostilities or acts of terrorism or natural disasters;

  

(F) any failure of the Company to meet any estimates, expectations or
projections, including revenues, earnings or other measures of financial
performance, for any period; provided, that the exception in this clause shall
not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect,
circumstance or development underlying such failure has resulted in, or
contributed to, a Material Adverse Effect;

  

(G) the execution, announcement or pendency of this Agreement and the
Transactions, including any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship of
the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries with any of their
respective customers, employees, suppliers, venders or other Persons with
business relations with the Company that the Company or its Significant
Subsidiaries establishes is the sole result of, and directly caused by, the
execution, announcement or pendency of this Agreement or the Transactions;

  

(H) any loss of or adverse change in the business relationship between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent or any of
its affiliates, on the other hand;

  

(I) any change of control payments or reasonable fees or expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions; or

  

(J) any action expressly required by this Agreement, including actions
required to be taken by this Agreement upon the specific request of Parent or
Merger Sub, or the failure to take any actions due to the restrictions set
forth in this Agreement;

  

 _provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (E), such
change, event, circumstance or development does not disproportionately
adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared
to other companies of similar size operating in the same industry in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

        

(b)

_Capital Structure_. 

---|--- 
  

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
100,000,000 Shares and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01
per share (the " _ _Preferred Stock__ "), of which 27,560,087 Shares and no
shares of Preferred Stock were outstanding as of the close of business on the
date hereof. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Other than 1,718,688 Shares
reserved for issuance under the Companys plans disclosed in Section 5.1(b)(i)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _ _Stock Plans__ ") and 400,000 shares
of Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock and the number of Shares
issuable on conversion thereof reserved for issuance under the Rights
Agreement, the Company has no Shares reserved for issuance.

  



  

-13-

  
   



  

Section 5.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of options, restricted stock,
and other stock under the Stock Plans, including the holder, date of grant,
term, number of Shares, exercise price and whether an option is intended to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422(b) of
the Code. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities
of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien,
charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance, except any
Encumbrance for Taxes or other governmental charges that are not yet due and
payable and except for restrictions imposed by Law (each, a " _ _Lien__ ").
Except as set forth above, for the Top-Up Option and the Rights, there are no
preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights,
stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for,
or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any
issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free and clear of any Liens. Upon any issuance of Shares pursuant to the
Top-Up Option, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not have
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on
any matter.

  

(ii) Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
(x) each of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the
Company in each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any
other Person or Persons in each such Subsidiary and (y) the Companys or its
Subsidiaries capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect
ownership interest in any other Person other than securities in a publicly
traded company held for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and consisting of less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such
company. The Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting interest
in any Person, the acquisition of which would require an additional filing by
Parent under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _ _HSR Act__ ").

  

(iii) Each Company Option (A) was granted in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the
Company Stock Plan pursuant to which it was issued, (B) qualifies for the tax
and accounting treatment afforded to such Company Option in the Companys Tax
returns and the Company Reports, respectively, (C) was otherwise properly
disclosed in the Company Reports and (D) has an exercise price at least equal
to the fair market value of a Share on a date no earlier than the date of the
corporate action authorizing the grant and has a grant date identical to the
date of the corporate action authorizing the grant. The Company has made
available to the Parent correct and complete copies of the Stock Plans and the
forms of all agreements evidencing the Company Options. No consent of the
holder of any Company Option is required in connection with the

  



  

-14-

  
   



  

actions contemplated by Section 4.3(a), and such actions so contemplated
comport with the Stock Plans and the underlying agreements evidencing the
Company Options.

        

(c)

_Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. 

---|--- 
  

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and
has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the Transactions,
in each case subject only, if applicable, to adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such
matter at a stockholders meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the "
_ _Company Requisite Vote__ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles (the " _ _Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception__ ").

  

(ii) The Company Board has unanimously adopted resolutions (A)
approving, adopting and declaring advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions and determining that the terms of the Transactions are fair to
and in the best interests of the holders of the Shares and (B) recommending
that the holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Merger Sub
pursuant to the Offer, and adopt this Agreement (the " _ _Company
Recommendation__ "). The Company Board has taken all action so that each of
Parent and Merger Sub will not be an "interested stockholder" or prohibited
from entering into or consummating a "business combination" with the Company
(in each case as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of
the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions in
the manner contemplated hereby.

  

(iii) The Company Board has received the written opinion of its
financial advisors, Sagent Advisors Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., to
the effect that the $95.50 per Share to be received by the holders of the
Shares in the Offer and the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to
such holders.

(i) Other than (A) the filings, approvals and/or notices pursuant to
Section 1.1, Section 1.2, Section 1.7 and Section 6.3, under the Exchange Act,
the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or under any other Securities Law,
regulation or Order, or under the HSR Act or under any other antitrust,
competition or premerger notification, trade regulation Law, regulation or
Order, (B) the filing and recordation of appropriate documents for the
Transactions as required by the DGCL and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which the Company is
qualified to do business, (C) compliance with and such filings as may be
required under applicable Environmental Laws or environmental property
transfer Laws, (D) such other items that may be required under the applicable
Law of any Governmental Entity solely by reason of the participation of
Parent or Merger Sub (as opposed to any third party) in the Merger or the
other Transactions, or (E) as set forth in Section 5.1(d)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be
made by

the Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any domestic or
foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court
or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each a " _
_Governmental Entity__ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the Transactions.

  

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, constitute
or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the comparable governing
documents of any of its Significant Subsidiaries or (B) with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or
right of termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to (x) any Material Contract, or (y) assuming
(solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the
Transactions) compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i),
any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except,
in the case of clause (B) above, for any such breaches, violations,
terminations, defaults, creations or accelerations that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the Transactions. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of Material Contracts pursuant
to which consents or waivers are or may be required prior to consummation of
the Transactions (whether or not subject to the exception set forth with
respect to clause (B) above).

  

(iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not creditors or claimants
with respect to any debtor or debtor-in-possession subject to proceedings
under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code with respect to claims
that, in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the gross assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding cash and cash equivalents).

the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _ _Sarbanes-Oxley Act__ "), and any rules

of their respective dates (or, if amended or superceded prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amendment or subsequently filed Company

Report), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof but prior to the Purchase
Date will not as of the date such Company Reports were filed or furnished,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made

summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

  

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed

the absence of footnotes and to normal year-end audit adjustments), in each
case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein.

  

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (a) the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time
such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented
or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the Companys
stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, or (b) the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information derived from the public SEC filings of Koninklijke
Philips Electronics N.V. (the " _ _Guarantor__ ") or supplied by or on behalf
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9 and the

  



  

-17-

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2006, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have, in all material respects, conducted their
respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such
businesses consistent with past practices and there has not been:

  

(i) any change in the financial condition, assets, business or results
of their operations of which the executive officers of the Company have
knowledge which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect;

  

(ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (except for dividends or other distributions by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary to the Company or to any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company), or any repurchase, redemption or other
acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its

practice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required by GAAP
and disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof;

  

(iv) (A) except to the extent required by applicable Laws or in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, any increase in
the compensation payable or to become payable to its directors, officers or
employees (except for increases in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices) or (B) any establishment, adoption, entry into
or amendment of any collective bargaining, bonus, profit sharing, thrift,
compensation, employment, termination, severance or other plan, agreement,
trust, fund, policy or arrangement for the benefit of any director, officer or
employee, except, in the case of clause (B) above, for any such establishment,
adoption, entry into or amendment that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; or

        

(v)

  |  

any agreement to do any of the foregoing. 

---|--- 
  

(h) _Litigation and Liabilities_. Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, threatened in writing
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its
Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or obligations (whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a nature

  



  

-18-

  
   



  

required by GAAP to be reflected, disclosed, accrued or reserved against in a
consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto, other than those liabilities
and obligations (A) reflected, disclosed, accrued or reserved against in the
Companys consolidated balance sheets (and the notes thereto) included in the
Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (B) incurred in connection
with the execution of this Agreement, (C) incurred in the ordinary course of
business since September 29, 2007, (D) that have been discharged or paid in
full prior to the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business,
or (E) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, or would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to the provisions of any material judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree
or award of any Governmental Entity that remains outstanding or unsatisfied
and that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the Transactions.

        

(i)

_Employee Benefits_. 

---|--- 
  

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
arrangements covering current or former employees or other service providers
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and current or former directors of the
Company (or their dependents, spouses or beneficiaries), including, but not
limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ _ERISA__ "),
deferred compensation, severance, stock option, stock purchase, stock
appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans (the " _ _Benefit
Plans__ "), other than Benefit Plans (including schemes mandated by a
government other than the United States) maintained outside of the United
States primarily for the benefit of employees or other service providers
working outside of the United States (such plans hereinafter being referred to
as " _ _Non-U.S. Benefit Plans__ "), are listed on Section 5.1(i)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and each Benefit Plan which has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service
National Office, including any master or prototype plan, has been separately
identified. With respect to each Benefit Plan listed on Section 5.1(i)(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has made available to Parent
correct and complete copies of (A) the current plan document or, in the case
of an unwritten Benefit Plan, a written description of such Benefit Plan, (B)
any current determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(" _ _IRS__ "), (C) the current summary plan description and subsequent
summaries of material modifications (other than with respect to Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans), (D) the most recent annual report (Form 5500 series) and
summary annual report, (E) any trust instruments or insurance contracts
forming a part of such Benefit Plan, and (F) all amendments thereto.

  

(ii) All Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _ _Multiemployer Plan__ ") and
Non U.S. Benefit Plans, (collectively, " _ _U.S. Benefit Plans__ ") comply in
form, and have been operated in compliance, in all material respects with
their terms and the requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws.
Each U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (an " _ _ERISA Plan__ ") that
is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA (a " _ _Pension Plan__ ") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code, has (A) received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
covering all Tax Law changes prior to the Economic Growth

  



  

-19-

  
   



  

and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (" _ _EGTRRA__ ") and (B) if the
applicable remedial amendment period under Rev. Proc. 2007-44 for such Pension
Plan has ended prior to the date hereof, the plan has applied to the IRS for a
determination letter covering all Tax Law changes through EGTRRA and, to the
knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, no event has occurred
since the date of such filing that would reasonably be considered likely to
result in the loss of the qualifications of any such Pension Plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code. Any voluntary employees beneficiary association
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code which provides benefits
under a U.S. Benefit Plan has (i) received a determination letter from the IRS
recognizing its exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (ii)
filed a timely notice with the IRS pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code
and, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, no event has
occurred since the date of such filing that would reasonably be considered
likely to result in the loss of such exempt status under Sections 501(c)(9) of
the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject the Company
or any Subsidiary to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in a material amount. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a material
tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or
any liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

  

(iii) No material liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA
has been or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, would
reasonably be expected to be, incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-
employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently
or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any
entity which is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of
ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an " _ _ERISA Affiliate__ ") and no such
liability, if any, remains unsatisfied. Since January 1, 2002, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have not incurred and, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of the Company, do not expect to incur prior to the Effective Time
any material withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions
of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the reporting requirement has not been
waived or extended, other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (" _ _PBGC__ ") Reg. Section 4043.33 or 4043.66, has been required
to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month
period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection
with the Transactions. No notices have been required to be sent to
participants and beneficiaries or the PBGC under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code.

  

(iv) All contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as
of the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of
each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
Reports prior to the date hereof, except where the failure to make timely
contributions or fulfill obligations would be immaterial. Neither any Pension
Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has and, to the
knowledge of the executive officers of the

  



  

-20-

  
   



  

Company, no circumstances exist that could result in an outstanding funding
waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of
ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year. It is not
currently and reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to
any Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required
to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an
ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. The Company and
its Subsidiaries took all actions necessary and appropriate to cease benefit
accruals under any frozen Pension Plan (or portion thereof) in accordance with
the Code, ERISA and other applicable Law (including timely delivery of all
required notices).

  

(v) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial
valuation), did not materially exceed the then current value of the assets of
such Pension Plan, and, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the
Company, there has been no material change in the financial condition, whether
or not as a result of a change in the funding method, of such Pension Plan
since the last day of the most recent plan year. The withdrawal liability of
the Company and its Subsidiaries under each Benefit Plan which is a
Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or an ERISA
Affiliate has contributed during the preceding 12 months, determined as if a
"complete withdrawal," within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA, had
occurred as of the date hereof, is not reasonably expected to exceed $10
million.

  

(vi) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, threatened litigation
relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan
or collective bargaining agreement. Pursuant to the terms of such Benefit
Plans, the Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any retiree
health or life Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any liability
thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or
termination.

  

(vii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement,
stockholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will (w) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date hereof, (x) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of
the Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans
which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the
Code. No Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any employee or director of
the Company or its

  



  

-21-

  
   



  

Subsidiaries with any amount of additional compensation if such individual is
provided amounts subject to excise or additional taxes imposed under Sections
409A or 4999 of the Code.

  

(viii) All NonU.S. Benefit Plans comply in form, and have been operated
in compliance in all material respects with applicable local Laws. All
Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed on Section 5.1(i)(viii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. To the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with
respect to any such NonU.S. Benefit Plan. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan which,
under the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States, is required
to be registered or approved by any Governmental Entity, has been so
registered and approved and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable Governmental Entities, and if intended to qualify for special tax
treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment.

  

(ix) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has any liabilities which
are not funded through so-called "rabbi trusts" or "secular trusts," or
insurance contracts or similar vehicles, pursuant to any Benefit Plan that is
not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan or an excess benefit plan. Each
Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined
under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated and administered in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance provided thereunder
from the period beginning January 1, 2005 through the date hereof and no such
Benefit Plan which was in effect prior to October 2, 2004, which the Company
determined to not be subject to Section 409A of the Code, has been materially
modified since October 2, 2004, except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
equity-based compensation arrangement or award granted under any Benefit Plan
is considered "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code.

  

(x) Any individual who performs or performed services for the Company
or its Subsidiaries and who is not treated as an employee for federal income
tax purposes by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is not an employee
under applicable Law or for any purpose, including, without limitation, for
tax withholding purposes or Benefit Plan purposes; the Company and the
Subsidiaries have no material liability by reason of an individual who
performs or performed services for the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in
any capacity being improperly excluded from participating in a Benefit Plan;
and each of the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries has been
properly classified by the Company and the Subsidiaries as "exempt" or "non-
exempt" under applicable Law.

  

(j) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any
federal, state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, or any rule,
regulation, standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, arbitration
award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental Entity
currently in effect (collectively, " _ _Laws__ "), except for violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the Transactions. To the knowledge of the executive
officers of the Company, no investigation by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending, nor has
any Governmental Entity

  



  

-22-

  
   



  

provided written notice of an intention to conduct the same, except for those
investigations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions. The Company
and its Subsidiaries each has obtained and is in compliance with all permits,
certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity (" _ _Licenses__ ") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted, except those the absence of which, or where the failure
to comply, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Transactions.

_Material Contracts and Government Contracts_. 

---|--- 
  

(i) Except for this Agreement and except for any material agreement,
lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other
obligation not otherwise terminable by the other party thereto on 90 days or
less notice (each, a " _ _Contract__ ") filed as exhibits to the Company
Reports, as of the date of this Agreement, none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Contract:

  

(A) that would be required to be filed by the Company as a "material
contract" pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act;

  

(B) that is reasonably likely to require aggregate payments of
royalties or other amounts to or from the Company and its Subsidiaries in 2007
or any subsequent calendar year of more than $750,000, or is reasonably likely
to require aggregate payments to or from the Company and its Subsidiaries in
any time period of more than $2 million, which, in either case, cannot be
cancelled by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without penalty or further
payment or obligation and without more than ninety (90) days notice;

  

(C) that would prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
Companys ability to consummate the Transactions;

  

(D) that (i) purports to limit in any material respect either the type
of business in which the Company or its Subsidiaries engages or the manner or
locations in which any of them so engages in any business, (ii) could require
the disposition of any material assets or line of business of the Company or
its respective Subsidiaries, (iii) grants "most favored nation" status or (iv)
prohibits or limits in any material respect the right of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to make, sell or distribute any products or services or use,
transfer, license, distribute or enforce any of their respective Intellectual
Property rights, in each case, which limitation, requirement, grant or
prohibition would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

  

(E) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
containing a standstill or similar agreement pursuant to which the Company or
any Subsidiary has agreed not to acquire assets or securities of the other
party or of any of the affiliates of such party;

  



  

-23-

  
   



  



  

(F) between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any director or
executive officer of the Company or any Person beneficially owning five
percent or more of the outstanding Shares;

  

(G) providing for indemnification by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any Person, except for such indemnification provisions as are
(x) customary in the Companys industry or incidental to the routine conduct
of its business, (y) not reasonably likely to be material to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (z) entered into in the ordinary
course of business (an " _ _Ordinary Course Indemnity__ "); and

  

(H) that contains a put, call or similar right pursuant to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be required to purchase or sell, as
applicable, any equity interests of any Person or assets that have a fair
market value or purchase price of more than $750,000 _ **.**_

  

Each such Contract described in clauses (A) through (H) is referred to herein
as a " _ _Material Contract__."

  

(ii) A correct and complete copy of each Material Contract has
previously been made available to Parent or publicly filed with the SEC as an
exhibit to the Company Reports. Each of the Material Contracts (and those
Contracts which would be Material Contracts but for the exception of being
filed as exhibits to the SEC Reports) is valid and binding on the Company or
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of the Company, each other party thereto and is in full force and
effect, except for such failures to be valid and binding or to be in full
force and effects as would not, or would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. There
is no default under any such Contracts by the Company or its Subsidiaries and
no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both would constitute a default thereunder by the Company or its Subsidiaries,
in each case except as would not, or would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(iii) (A) With respect to each Government Contract, to the
knowledge of the executive officers of the Company and except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, (x) all representations and certifications executed,
acknowledged or set forth in or pertaining to such Governmental Contract on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries were complete and correct in
all material respects as of their effective date, and the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all such
representations and certifications; (y) neither a Governmental Entity nor any
prime contractor, subcontractor or other Person acting on behalf of a
Governmental Entity or a Government Contract has notified the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in writing that the Company or any such Subsidiary has
breached or violated any material certification, representation, clause,
provision or requirement, pertaining to such Government Contract; and (z) no
termination for convenience, termination for default, cure notice or show
cause notice is in effect as of the date hereof pertaining to any Government
Contract.

  



  

-24-

  
   



  



  

(B) To the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, (x)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
that it or any of its personnel is under administrative, civil, or criminal
investigation, or indictment or audit by any Governmental Entity with respect
to any alleged irregularity, misstatement or omission arising under or
relating to any Government Contract, (y) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has conducted or initiated any internal investigation or made a
voluntary disclosure to the United States government with respect to any
alleged irregularity, misstatement or omission arising under or relating to a
Government Contract and (z) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, any of their
respective personnel has been suspended or debarred from doing business with
the United States government or is, or at any time has been, the subject of a
finding of non-responsibility or ineligibility for United States government
contracting.

  

As used herein, " _ _Government Contract__ " means any material Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of
them are bound, as of the date of this Agreement, the contracting party of
which is a Governmental Entity.

_Real Property_. 

---|--- 
  

(i) Except in any such case as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, with
respect to the real property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _
_Owned Real Property__ "), (A) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, has good and marketable title to the Owned Real Property, free and
clear of any Encumbrance, and (B) there are no outstanding options or rights
of first refusal to purchase the Owned Real Property, or any portion thereof
or interest therein.

  

(ii) With respect to the real property leased or subleased to the
Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _ _Leased Real Property__ "), the lease or
sublease for such property is valid, legally binding, enforceable on the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the
executive officers of the Company, each other party thereto and is in full
force and effect, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in
breach of or default under such lease or sublease, and no event has occurred
which, with notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or
default by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries or permit termination,
modification or acceleration by any third party thereunder, or prevent,

shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the

providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

  

(c) Parent shall not knowingly take or permit any of its Subsidiaries
to take any action that is reasonably likely to (i) result in any of the
conditions to the Offer set forth in Exhibit 1 not being satisfied or the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied or (ii)

_Acquisition Proposals_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except
as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2 and Section 1.1(a), neither it nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives, collectively, " _ _Representatives__ ") not to,
directly or indirectly:

  

(i) initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

  



  

-35-

  
   



  



  

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to
any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

  

(iii) otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition
Proposal.

  

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the
Purchase Date, but not after, the Company may (A) provide information in
response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal providing for the acquisition of more than
50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company if the Company receives
from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and promptly discloses (and, if
applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to the extent
not previously provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; and/or (C) after having complied with
Section 6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose
to approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any
action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the Company Board determines
in good faith after receiving legal advice from outside legal counsel that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (y) in each
such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company Board has
determined in good faith based on the information then available and after
consultation with its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal.

        

(b)

  |  

_Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement: 

---|--- 
  

" _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to
a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries and (ii) any inquiry, proposal or offer to acquire in
any manner, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the total voting power or
20% or more of the outstanding shares of any class of equity securities of the
Company or those of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or 20% or more of the
consolidated total assets (including, without limitation, equity securities of
its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the Transactions or
otherwise from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that for
purposes of this definition and Section 8.2, the term "Significant
Subsidiaries" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation
S-X promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, but substituting 20% for
references of 10% therein.

  

" _ _Superior Proposal__ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
(on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) (with
all references to 20%

  



  

-36-

  
   



  

in the definition of Acquisition Proposal deemed to be 50%) that the Company
Board has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the
proposal, and, if consummated, would reasonably be expected to result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the Transactions (after taking into account any revisions
to the terms of the transaction contemplated by Section 6.2(c) of this
Agreement) and the time likely to be required to consummate such Acquisition
Proposal).

  

(c) _No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. The Company Board and each committee thereof shall not:

  

(i) except as provided in this Section 6.2, withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation
with respect to the Offer and the Merger; or

  

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, this
Section 6.2, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(a))
(an " _ _Alternative Acquisition Agreement__ ") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal;

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the Purchase Date, but not after, the Company Board may withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made after the date hereof
that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in breach of this
Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after receiving
legal advice from outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ "). No Change
of Recommendation may be made until after at least 48 hours following Parents
receipt of notice from the Company advising that management of the
Company currently intends to recommend to the Company Board that it take such
action and the basis therefore, including the information under Section
6.2(f). In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation in response
to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Company Board shall consider any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other
information provided by Parent in response to such notice. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.2, including with respect to the
notice period referred to in this Section 6.2.

  

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section
6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal or making a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure (other than a "stop,
look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) does not reaffirm the
Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be

  



  

-37-

  
   



  

deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1(c).

  

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2
and in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will (i)
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries and
(ii) enforce and not waive the terms of any such confidentiality agreement.

  

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any
event, within 24 hours) notify Parent **** if any inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are
sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers
(including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

  

6.3. _Proxy Statement_. Unless Parent and Merger Sub own 90% or more of
the outstanding Shares, after the Purchase Date, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable following expiration of the
Offer, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders
Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto,
the " _ _Proxy Statement__ "). The Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the
receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of
any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with
respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the
Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as
possible after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments
thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

  

6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. Unless Parent and Merger Sub own 90% or
more of the outstanding Shares after purchasing Shares in the Offer, the
Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders
of Shares (the " _ _Stockholders Meeting__ ") as promptly as practicable after
the Purchase Date to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement
and, provided that the Purchase Date has occurred, shall not postpone or
adjourn such meeting except that, after

  



  

-38-

  
   



  

consultation with the Parent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Stockholders Meeting to the extent legally necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders
Meeting. After the Purchase Date, the Company will prepare and distribute as
promptly as practicable any such required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement and following any such adjournment or postponement of the
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall take all action necessary to reconvene
the Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after such adjournment or
postponement. After the Purchase Date, except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.2 or to the extent that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after receiving legal advice from outside legal counsel to the Company) that
to do so would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders, the Company Board shall recommend such
adoption. Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates shall vote all of
their Shares in favor of the Merger. If Parent and Merger Sub own 90% or more
of the outstanding Shares after purchasing Shares in the Offer, the parties
shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable thereafter without a stockholders meeting in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

        

6.5.

its assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein or to any agreement by the Company to take any of the
foregoing actions) or to agree to any material changes (including, without
limitation, through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other

and/or its Subsidiaries and third parties or (B) sell, divest, lease, license,

case, (x) that did not individually or in the aggregate account for more than
$50,000,000 in gross revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006,
(y) subject in each case to receipt of the consent of any third parties, in
the case of any amendment or modification of any Contract, that would not
cause the terms of such Contract to be commercially unreasonable when compared
to other similar Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (z) that
could not reasonably be expected to substantially impair the benefits to
Parent reasonably expected, as of the date of this Agreement, to be realized
from consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , that Parent can compel the
Company or its Subsidiaries to take any of the actions referred to above (or
agree to take such actions) if such actions are only effective after the
Effective Time. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_
, that Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in

respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written

Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the Transactions, including

to the Transactions. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
change, fact or condition that is reasonably expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition in Exhibit 1. Neither the
Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other

compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements that have been or
will be entered into by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates with current or future directors, officers or employees of the
Company and its affiliates and to insure that any such arrangements fall
within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

---|--- 
  

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other

shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested, _provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty

obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant

Entity.

        

6.9.

  |  

_Employee Benefits_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, it shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide the non-unionized employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the " _ _Affected
Employees__ ") with base compensation that is substantially comparable in the
aggregate, as determined by Parent, to those provided by Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Additionally, Parent agrees that with respect to the Companys 2007
bonus plan, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall apply the metrics set forth in
such plan in a manner consistent with past practices, (ii) the bonuses
thereunder to be paid shall not be adversely affected by the Transactions and
shall be paid in a manner and at a time consistent with past practice and
(iii) in no event shall the bonuses thereunder be less than the amount accrued
for such bonuses on the Companys balance sheet as such bonuses are accrued in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Parent and the
Company also agree to the items set forth in Section 6.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  

(b) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Affected
Employees will continue to be provided with pension and welfare benefits under
employee benefit plans that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees or
generally comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as elected by Parent in its sole
discretion. Parent will cause any employee benefit plans of Parent which the
Affected Employees are entitled to participate in to take into account for
purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder, except for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits, service by employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such
service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and to the extent that such time period is recognized under the
terms of such plan of Parent.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company

  



  

-42-

  
   



  

shall (i) cause to be amended the employee benefit plans and arrangements of
it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide that no employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence participation therein following
the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary
explicitly authorizes such participation and (ii) cause the Company 401(k)
plans to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(d) The Company agrees to cause each of its officers and directors to
repay any outstanding liens or notes to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time.

  

(e) Parent shall, to the extent permissible under its employee welfare
benefit package (after all commercially reasonable good faith efforts by
Parent to eliminate any bars to such permissibility), waive, or cause to be
waived, any pre-existing condition, evidence of insurability, waiting period,
continuing-course-of-treatment, or actively-at-work requirement limitation
under any employee welfare benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA,
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates (other than the
Surviving Corporation) in which Affected Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
with respect to those Affected Employees (and their eligible dependents)
except, with respect to any Person, to the extent that such requirements would
have been applicable to such Person under the comparable employee welfare
benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits, Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount
of all expenses incurred by each Affected Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible, co-payment and "out-of-pocket"
maximum limitations under the relevant employee welfare benefit plans, as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i)
be treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to (x)
maintain any particular Benefit Plan or (y) retain the employment of any
particular employee.

  

6.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.2, whether or
not the Shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, except (a) that expenses incurred in connection with
the filing fee for the Schedule TO, and publishing, printing and mailing of
the Offer Documents and, if applicable, the Proxy Statement (but not the
attorneys fees related thereto, which shall be paid by the party incurring
such expense) shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company and (b) if the
Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses.

        

6.11.

  |  

_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) From and after the Purchase Date, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(in each case, when acting in such

  



  

-43-

  
   



  

capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__
"), against any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including matters,
acts or omissions occurring in connection with (i) the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions or (ii) serving as a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under Delaware Law
and its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and any applicable Contracts in
effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law and any applicable Contracts; _provided_
, that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification by a court of competent jurisdiction) and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Delaware Law and the Companys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and any applicable Contracts shall be made
by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties.

  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay
for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction
unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest; provided that the fewest number of
counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and
(iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent; and provided,
further, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim

  



  

-44-

  
   



  

(and in which indemnification could be sought by any Indemnified Party under
this Section 6.11), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents in writing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
then the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

(c) Prior to the Purchase Date, the Company shall and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _ _D andO
Insurance__") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions or actions contemplated hereby), provided, however, that
in no event shall the Company expend for such policies a premium amount in
excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid by the Company. If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date hereof with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in excess of 250% of the current annual premiums currently paid by the Company
for DandO Insurance; and, provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.11.

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties or
their respective heirs, representatives, successors or assigns. None of the
provisions of Sections 6.11(a) or (b) shall limit any right that any
Indemnified Party may have under any Contract in effect on the date hereof to
indemnify such Person.

  



  

-45-

  
   



  



  

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other governance documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation from liability set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other governance documents of the Company or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, as of the date of this Agreement, and, after
the Purchase Date, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party.

  

(g) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Party may incur in successfully
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
6.11 following the final decision by a court of competent jurisdiction that an
Indemnified Party is entitled to the indemnity and other obligations provided
for in this Section 6.11.

counsel for the other party for its review copies of such resolutions to be
adopted by its board of directors prior to such adoption and the Company shall

-47-

  
   



  

any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue or incorrect on
any date subsequent to the date of this Agreement, in each case in a manner
that would cause any condition in clause (a) or (b) on Exhibit 1 hereto not to

or, if curable, has not been cured within the earlier of (x) the Outside Date
or (y) 30 Business Days after written notice thereof has been given to the

(d) by the Company at any time prior to the Purchase Date, if Parent or

expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions and is not curable or, if
curable, has not been cured within the earlier of (x) the Outside Date or (y)
30 Business Days after written notice thereof has been given to Parent or

not be terminated pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) after Merger Sub has
purchased Shares pursuant to the Offer;

8.2.

  |  

_Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. 

---|--- 
  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment
of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, upon written notice thereof to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of
its Representatives or affiliates); provided, however, and notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) other than as set forth in
this Section 8.2, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any
liability or damages to the other party hereto resulting from any willful and
material breach of this Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in the
second sentence of Section 9.1 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

  

(b) In the event that (i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries and thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b), (ii)
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or
(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or
Section 8.1(c)(iii), then, subject to the proviso set forth below, the Company
shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after the date

  



  

-48-

  
   



  

of such termination, pay Parent a termination fee of $60 million (the " _
_Termination Fee__ ") and shall promptly, but in no event later than five
Business Days after the date of being notified of such by Parent, pay all of
the documented out of pocket expenses, including those of the Paying Agent,
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions up to a maximum amount of $6 million, in each case payable by
wire transfer of same day funds; provided, however, that no Termination Fee
shall be payable to Parent pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph (b) unless
and until within 12 months of such termination the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternate Acquisition Agreement with
respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have approved or recommended to
the Companys stockholders, an Acquisition Proposal (substituting "50%" for
"20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal). The Company acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2(b) are an integral part of
the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this Section 8.2(b) or
any portion of such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Parent or Merger Sub fails
to prevail in any such suit, Parent shall promptly pay the Companys costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection therewith.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the
Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.2, the Termination Fee shall constitute each of Parent and Merger
Subs sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement other than with respect
to a material breach of Section 6.2 by the Company, in which case acceptance
of the Termination Fee required to be paid by the Company to Parent pursuant
to this Section 8.2 by Parent shall constitute each of Parents and Merger
Subs sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement.

reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference
shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the
information referred to has been made available by the party to whom such
information is to be made available. The phrases "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" shall be inclusive and
not exclusive. Any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine
and neuter forms. All references to dollars or "$" shall be references to
United States dollars. The phrase "to the knowledge of the executive officers

Section 5.1(i) only, shall refer to the knowledge of the human resource
officers of the Company as well.

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly

disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

  

(c) The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure
Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information
is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

of Law or otherwise; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub may assign,
by prior written notice to the Company, any of their rights or obligations
hereunder to a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, except
that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Parent and
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such affiliate as of the date of such
designation; provided, that any such designation shall not materially impede
or delay the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise materially impede
the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement and that no
such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations

  



  

-53-

  
   



  

hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 _ **EXHIBIT 1**_

  

 _CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER_

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, but subject to compliance
with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, and in addition to (and not in
limitation of) the rights and obligations of Merger Sub to extend and/or amend
the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be obligated to accept for payment, and (subject to any applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer)) shall
not be obligated to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not
theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) unless, prior to the expiration
of the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to Section 1.1(a) of the
Agreement), there shall have been tendered and not validly withdrawn Shares
that, considered together with all other Shares (if any) beneficially owned by
Parent and its affiliates, represent one share more than 50% of the
outstanding Shares (on a fully diluted basis). The preceding condition is
referred to as the " _ _Minimum Tender Condition__."

  

Furthermore, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment, and
(subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs
obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer)) shall not be obligated to pay for any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or
paid for) if, upon the expiration of the Offer (as it may have been extended
pursuant to Section 1.1(a) of the Agreement) and before acceptance of such
Shares for payment, any of the following conditions exists and is continuing,
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition (other than any
such circumstances directly caused by any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of
any of their representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or obligations under the Agreement):

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement that are qualified as to materiality shall not be true and correct
and those not so qualified shall not be true and correct in all material
respects, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Purchase Date, as
though made on and as of the Purchase Date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which
case such representations and warranties qualified as to materiality shall not
be true and correct, and those not so qualified shall not be true and correct
in all material respects, on and as of such earlier date), except, in each
case, where the (A) failure of such representations or warranties (other than
the representations or warranties in Section 5.1(b)(i), Section 5.1(c), the
last sentence of Section 5.1(m) and Section 5.1(s)) to be true and correct
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and (B) failure of the
representations or warranties in Section 5.1(b)(i), Section 5.1(c), the last
sentence of Section 5.1(m) and

  
   



  

Section 5.1(s) to be true and correct is not, individually or in the
aggregate, a failure to be true and correct in all material respects.

  

(b) The Company shall have failed to perform and comply with, in any
material respect, any of its obligations, agreements and covenants to be
performed or complied with by it under the Agreement on or prior to the
Expiration Date.

  

(c) The Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate
signed by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the
Company and certifying as to the satisfaction by the Company of the absence of
the failure of (i) the Companys representations and warranties to be true and
correct, as specified in clause (a) of this Exhibit 1, and (ii) the Company to
perform and comply with, in any material respect, its obligations, agreement
and covenants, as specified in clause (b) of this Exhibit 1.

  

(d) An Order is in effect as of the Expiration Date and has the effect
of making the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

  

(e) Any mandatory waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer shall not have expired or been
terminated and the other required filings set forth in Section 6.5(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _ _Required Filings__ ") shall not have been
made, and any approvals related to the Required Filings shall not have been
obtained or, if applicable, any mandatory waiting periods related to the
Required Filings shall not have expired.

  

(f) The Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

  

(g) There shall have occurred a declaration of a banking moratorium or
any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States that
prevents the payment of the Offer Price.

  

(h) There shall have occurred any change, event, circumstances or
development that has had a Material Adverse Effect.

  

Notwithstanding anything in this _Exhibit A_ to the contrary, Parent and
Merger Sub may not rely on any condition set forth in this _Exhibit A_ other
than the Minimum Tender Condition and clauses (d) and (f) if Merger Sub makes
available a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Exchange Act Rule
14d-11.

  

Any and all capitalized terms used herein, and not defined herein, shall have
the same meaning as set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 25, 2007, by and among The Genlyte Group Incorporated, Philips
Holding USA Inc. and Golf Merger Sub, Inc.
