Section 2.01. _Management Rollover_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, immediately prior to the Closing, the Buyer and
the Company shall, to the extent within their respective control, cause the
Management Rollover to be consummated in accordance with the Rollover
Agreements. For purposes hereof, "Remaining Company Equity Interests" means
the outstanding Company Equity Interests, other than the Rollover Company
Equity Interests.

(b) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to the Buyer a schedule setting forth the Allocated
Portion (as defined in the Rollover Agreements) for each Rollover Member;
_provided_ , that the Company may provide an alternative schedule to the
Buyer no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

Section 2.02.  _The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with the Limited
Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving limited liability company (the "Surviving Company").

 

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State. 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any party or any other Person:

 

(i) the Rollover Company Equity Interests outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Rollover Agreement;

(ii) the Remaining Company Equity Interests outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right of the Seller holding
such Remaining Company Equity Interests at such time to receive such Sellers
portion of the Purchase Price determined and paid as provided in Sections
2.04 and 2.05 and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 2.06
and 2.07 (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"); and

 

(iii) the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become a membership interest in the Surviving Company on the terms
set forth in the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of
the Company entered into at the Closing or otherwise as determined by the
Buyer in its sole and absolute discretion;

 



21 and, in each case in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), such Company
Equity Interests or limited liability company interests of Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right of the holders thereof to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration, membership interests in the Surviving Company or other
consideration as provided herein.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of formation of the
Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of formation of the Surviving Company and (ii) the amended and
restated limited liability company agreement of the Company entered into at
the Closing shall be the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company, in each case until thereafter amended in accordance
therewith and with Applicable Law (subject, in each case, to Section 6.09).

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, (i) the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Company, and (ii) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, in each
case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified in accordance with the limited liability company agreement of the
Company and Applicable Law.

(f) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of each of the Company
and Merger Sub, in each case as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.03. _Estimated Closing Statement_. No later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer a
statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement"), certified by the Companys
Chief Financial Officer setting forth (a) the Companys good faith estimates
of the Closing CLO Investment Value, the Closing Cash Adjustment, the Closing
Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, and the Closing Revenue Run
Rate Adjustment, (b) using the amounts referred to in the preceding clause
(a), the resulting (i) Purchase Price (the "Estimated Purchase Price"), and
(ii) the amount equal to (A) the Estimated Purchase Price, _minus_ (B) the sum
of (w) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, (x) the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, (y) the Seller Representative Expense Fund Amount and (z) the
Aggregate Rollover Amount (such difference, the "Aggregate Closing Payment"),
and (c) a schedule setting forth (i) the portion of the Aggregate Closing
Payment to be paid to each of the Sellers in accordance with the methodology
set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ C_ (such Sellers "Closing Payment", such
methodology, as applied by the Seller Representative, the "Proceeds
Allocation Methodology" and such schedule, the "Allocation Schedule"), and
(ii) the account to which each Sellers Closing Payment shall be paid. The
Estimated Closing Statement shall be delivered with reasonable supporting
detail

 



22  with respect to the calculation of all amounts included therein and, to the
extent reasonably requested by the Buyer, the Company shall promptly make
available to the Buyer and its Representatives the employees and auditors of
the Company Entities and all records and work papers used in preparing the
Estimated Closing Statement. The Company will promptly review any comments
proposed by the Buyer to the Estimated Closing Statement and will consider,
in good faith, any appropriate changes in light of such comments; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) any disagreement between the parties with respect to the
Estimated Closing Statement shall not delay the Closing and (2) the Company
shall have no obligation to make any changes to the Estimated Closing
Statement pursuant to this sentence. None of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) shall have any liability
in connection with or related to the Allocation Schedule.

Section 2.04. _Closing_. (a) The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue,
New York, New York, as soon as possible, but in no event later than the later
of (A) three Business Days, after satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of the conditions set
forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing), (B) the Business Day
following the last day of the Marketing Period, and (C) if applicable, the
Business Day specified in the last sentence of Section 6.11(g), or at such
other time or place as the Buyer and the Company may agree in writing.

(b) At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay an aggregate amount equal to the
Estimated Purchase Price, less the Aggregate Rollover Amount, allocated as
follows:

(i) to the Escrow Agent, $1,000,000 (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount") in immediately available funds by wire transfer, which amount shall
be deposited into an escrow fund (the "Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund") available to compensate the Buyer for any amounts due to it
under the purchase price adjustment provisions of Section 2.06, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement;

 

(ii) to the Escrow Agent, $20,000,000 (the "Indemnity Escrow Amount") in
immediately available funds by wire transfer, which amount shall be deposited
into an escrow fund (the "Indemnity Escrow Fund") available to compensate the
Buyer for any amounts due to it (A) in the event of an Escrow Shortfall Amount
or (B) under the indemnification provisions of Article 12, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement;

 

(iii) to the Escrow Agent, an amount calculated pursuant to Section
2.04(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Seller Representative
Expense Fund Amount") in immediately available funds by wire transfer, which
amount shall be deposited into an escrow fund (the "Seller Representative  

 



23  Expense Fund") available to pay the Seller Representative for its costs,
expenses and any other Seller Representative Losses due to it under the
provisions of Article 11, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement ( _provided_ , that the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the
Seller Representative Expense Fund shall each be separate funds and the
amounts contained therein shall not be commingled); and

(iv) to each of the Sellers, an amount equal to its Closing Payment in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to the account of such Seller set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement; _provided,_ that such payment shall
be made subject to and in accordance with Section 2.05, and to the account of
such Seller set forth in such Sellers Letter of Transmittal, if different
from the account of such Seller set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement.

 

(c) At the Closing, (i) each of the Seller Representative and the Buyer shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the other such party the Escrow
Agreement, duly executed by such party and the Escrow Agent, and (ii) the
Company shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate from the Company that meets
the requirements of U.S. Treasury Regulation 1.1445-11T(d)(2).

(d) At the Closing, the Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf
of the Company Entities, the Closing Indebtedness listed in Section 2.04(d)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) designated by the holders of such Closing Indebtedness
and the Company shall deliver to Buyer customary payoff letters from the
holders of such Closing Indebtedness and executed lien release documents,
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, with respect to all Liens, if any, in or
upon the assets or properties of the Company Entities in respect of such
repaid Closing Indebtedness to be released or terminated prior to the Closing.

(e) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Closing
Transaction Expenses (based upon the Estimated Closing Statement) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the Seller
Representative.

 

Section 2.05. _Surrender and Payment_. At least five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall send to each Seller a letter of transmittal
and instructions substantially in the form of _Schedule_ __ _ D_ hereto (a
"Letter of Transmittal") for use in connection with the payment of the Merger
Consideration to the Sellers hereunder. At or after the Closing, each Seller
shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Buyer of a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal, such Sellers Closing Payment. No later than
the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to the Buyer all executed Letters of Transmittal that the Company has
received. None of the Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Company or any
Affiliate of the Buyer or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any Seller
or any other Person for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Laws.

 



24 Section 2.06. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment._ (a) As promptly
as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall prepare and deliver or cause to be prepared and delivered to the Seller
Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement"), setting forth
the Buyers reasonable and good faith calculation of (i) the Closing CLO
Investment Value, the Closing Cash Adjustment, the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Revenue Run Rate Adjustment and
(ii) using the amounts referred to in the preceding clause (i), the resulting
Purchase Price, together with copies of such documents and information used by
the Buyer in its calculation of such amounts as are reasonably necessary for
the Seller Representative to review and verify such amounts.

(b) If the Buyer fails to timely deliver the Closing Statement in accordance
with Section 2.06(a), then, at the Seller Representatives election, either
(i) the Estimated Closing Statement, including the Companys calculation of
the Purchase Price set forth therein, shall be final and binding upon the
Buyer and the Sellers or (ii) the Seller Representative shall submit the
Estimated Closing Statement to the Accounting Referee, together with a notice
specifying those items or amounts therein as to which the Seller
Representative disagrees and the Seller Representatives resulting
calculation of the Purchase Price, and shall cause the Accounting Referee to
promptly review this Agreement and such items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the Purchase Price. The Accounting Referees review and report
pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (ii) shall be performed in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.06(d), _mutatis
mutandis_ , except that the Accounting Referees review shall be limited to
those items or amounts specified in the Seller Representatives notice
delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (ii), and shall be
based solely on written materials, presentations and arguments submitted
and/or made by the Seller Representative.

(c) If the Buyer timely delivers the Closing Statement in accordance with
Section 2.06(a), and the Seller Representative disagrees with the Buyers
calculation of the Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement, the
Seller Representative may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Closing Statement, deliver written notice (a "Notice of Disagreement") to the
Buyer disagreeing with the Buyers calculation of the Purchase Price set forth
in the Closing Statement, and specifying, in reasonable detail the Seller
Representatives calculation of the Purchase Price. If the Seller
Representative does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement within such thirty
(30) day period, then the parties agree that the Closing Statement delivered
by the Buyer shall become final and binding on the parties hereto. Any Notice
of Disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which the Seller
Representative disagrees (each, a "Disputed Matter"), and the Seller
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement. The Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall, within three Business Days after delivery of the Notice
of Disagreement, deliver to the Escrow Agent irrevocable instructions giving
effect to any payments or releases provided for by Sections 2.06(g) or
2.06(h) in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, solely to the
extent applicable in light of the extent to which the Seller Representative
has agreed with the Buyers calculation of the Purchase Price set forth in
the Closing Statement (it being understood and agreed that, for the avoidance
of doubt,

 



25  the amount remaining in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund following
any such payments or releases shall be equal to the lesser of (i) the
difference between the Seller Representatives calculation of the Purchase
Price set forth in the Notice of Disagreement and the Buyers calculation of
the Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement and (ii) the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Amount). 

(d) If the Seller Representative delivers a Notice of Disagreement, the Buyer
and the Seller Representative shall, during the 15 days after delivery
thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
Disputed Matters in order to determine the Purchase Price, which amount shall
not be more than the Purchase Price set forth in the Notice of Disagreement
nor less than the Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement. If the
Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable to reach agreement as to the
Purchase Price during such period, either such party may thereafter cause KPMG
LLP, or if KPMG LLP is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, another
independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller Representative (which shall not have
any material relationship with the Buyer, the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates) (the "Accounting Referee"), to promptly review this
Agreement and the Disputed Matters for the purpose of calculating the Purchase
Price. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall be bound by
the terms of this Agreement, including the definitions of the Closing CLO
Investment Value, the Closing Cash Adjustment, the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Revenue Run Rate Adjustment and the
Purchase Price, and the terms of this Section 2.06(d), shall consider only the
Disputed Matters and shall not assign a value to any Disputed Matter greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by any party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by any party, in each case as set forth
in the Closing Statement or the Notice of Disagreement, as applicable. The
Accounting Referees determination of any Disputed Matter shall be based
solely on written materials, presentations and arguments submitted and/or
made by the Buyer and the Seller Representative (i.e., shall not be based on
an independent review). The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the Buyer and
the Seller Representative, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth
its calculation of the Disputed Matters and the Purchase Price. Such report
shall be final and binding upon the Buyer and the Sellers. The cost of such
review and report shall be borne (i) by the Sellers, if the difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Seller Representatives calculation
of the Purchase Price set forth in the Notice of Disagreement is greater than
the difference between the Final Purchase Price and the Buyers calculation
of the Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement, (ii) by the Buyer,
if the first such difference is less than the second such difference, and
(iii) otherwise, equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers,
on the other hand. Any amount payable by the Sellers pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence may be paid to the Accounting Referee out of
the Seller Representative Expense Fund, and shall be paid at the same time as
the payments and releases therefrom provided for by Section 2.06(g) or
2.06(h), as applicable.

 



26 (e) Each of the Buyer and the Seller Representative agrees that it shall, and
agrees to use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective independent
accountants and, in the case of the Buyer, the Company Entities to, cooperate
and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of
the Purchase Price and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this
Section 2.06, including making available, to the extent reasonably requested,
books, records, work papers and personnel during normal business hours.

 

(f) "Final Purchase Price" means (i) if the Buyer does not timely deliver the
Closing Statement in accordance with Section 2.06(a), the Companys
calculation of the Purchase Price set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement, or the Purchase Price as determined by the Accounting Referee
pursuant to Section 2.06(b), as applicable, based on the
Seller Representatives election in accordance with Section 2.06(b); (ii) if
the Buyer timely delivers the Closing Statement in accordance with Section
2.06(a), and the Seller Representative does not deliver any Notice of
Disagreement within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Statement,
the Buyers calculation of the Purchase Price set forth in the Closing
Statement; or (iii) if the Buyer timely delivers the Closing Statement in
accordance with Section 2.06(a), and the Seller Representative does deliver a
Notice of Disagreement within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Statement,
(A) the Purchase Price as agreed by the Buyer and the Seller Representative
pursuant to Section 2.06(d) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, the
Purchase Price as determined by the Accounting Referee pursuant to Section
2.06(d); _provided_ , that in no event shall the Final Purchase Price
determined by the Accounting Referee be more than the Companys calculation
thereof set forth in the Notice of Disagreement or less than the Buyers
calculation thereof set forth in the Closing Statement. "Adjustment Date"
means the date on which the Final Purchase Price is determined pursuant to
this Section 2.06.

(g) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price (the
absolute value of such difference, the "Shortfall Amount"), then, subject to
the last sentence of this Section 2.06(g), the Shortfall Amount shall be paid
to the Buyer out of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, to the extent
such amount has not previously been paid to the Buyer pursuant to Section
2.06(c). If any portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount remains
after such payment to the Buyer, then such remaining amount shall be released
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Sellers, in accordance
with the Proceeds Allocation Methodology and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, and paid to each Seller in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to the account of such Seller set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement (or, in the case of the Sellers, the account of such Seller set
forth in such Sellers Letter of Transmittal, if different from the account of
such Seller sets forth in the Estimated Closing Statement). If the
funds available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund are less than
the Shortfall Amount (such deficit, the "Escrow Shortfall Amount"), then, the
Escrow Shortfall Amount shall be paid to the Buyer out of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund. The Buyer and the Seller Representative shall, within three (3)
Business Days after the Adjustment Date, deliver to the Escrow Agent
irrevocable instructions giving effect to any payment or release provided for
by this Section 2.06(g) in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer agrees that its
sole recourse in respect of any amount payable pursuant to this Section
2.06(g) shall be the right to seek payment from the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund and, if applicable, the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and the Buyer shall have
no right to seek payment directly from the Sellers in respect of any such
amount.

 



27 (h) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than or equal to the Estimated
Purchase Price, then the Buyer shall pay the amount of such difference, if
any, to the Sellers in accordance with the Proceeds Allocation Methodology,
and the entire amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund shall be
released to the Sellers in accordance with the Proceeds Allocation
Methodology and, in each case, the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to the
extent not previously released to the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.06(b), and
paid to each Seller in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the
account of such Seller set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement (or, in
the case of the Sellers, the account of such Seller set forth in such Sellers
Letter of Transmittal, if different from the account of such Seller set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement). The Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall, within three Business Days after the Adjustment Date, deliver to the
Escrow Agent irrevocable instructions giving effect to any payment or release
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund provided for by this Section
2.06(h) in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
determination of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment is intended solely to
reflect changes between the Closing Working Capital and Target Closing Working
Capital, and any such change can be measured only if Closing Working Capital
and the calculations and determinations thereof are prepared using the
Accounting Principles. The purchase price adjustment in this Section 2.06 is
not intended to be used to adjust the Purchase Price for errors or omissions,
under GAAP or otherwise, that may be found with respect to the Balance Sheet
or the preparation of Target Closing Working Capital. No fact or event
occurring at or after the Closing, including any market or
business development or actions taken by the Buyer or any Company Entity with
respect to the accounting records, books, policies or procedures of any
Company Entity (including changes in any reserve, allowance or other account,
any changes in methodology for inventory valuation or accounting or any
reclassification of any asset), or any change in GAAP or Applicable Law after
the date hereof, or any effect on the Company Entities arising from the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall have any effect on, or be considered
in, the determination of the Final Purchase Price (or any of the components
thereof).

Section 2.07.  _Post-Closing True-Up_. If the Final Closing Revenue Run Rate
Adjustment is not zero, then:

 

(a) From the Closing Date through the date that is the last Business Day of
the sixth month following the Closing Date (the "True-Up Date"), the Buyer
shall promptly provide the Seller Representative with copies of any Client
Consents, termination notices or similar correspondence received by the Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) during such period (the
"True-Up Period") from any Clients that directly bear on the calculations to
be performed pursuant to this Section 2.07.

 



28 (b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the True-Up Date, the Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Seller Representative a statement (the "True-Up Statement") setting forth
the Buyers calculation of the True-Up Revenue Run Rate Adjustment, together
with copies of such documents and information used by the Buyer in its
calculation of such amounts as are reasonably necessary for the Seller
Representative to review and verify such amounts.

(c) The provisions of Section 2.06(b) through (e) shall apply, _ mutatis
mutandis_ , with respect to the Seller Representatives review of the True-Up
Statement, the delivery of any notice of disagreement with respect to the
calculation of True-Up Revenue Run Rate Adjustment by the Seller
Representative and the resolution of any such disagreement between the parties
with respect to the calculation of True-Up Revenue Run Rate Adjustment.

(d) If the amount of the Final Closing Revenue Run Rate Adjustment exceeds the
amount of the True-Up Revenue Run Rate Adjustment, then the Buyer shall pay
the amount of such difference to the Sellers in accordance with the Proceeds
Allocation Methodology at a mutually convenient time and place, within
five Business Days after the True-Up Revenue Run Rate Adjustment has been
finally determined by the parties pursuant to Section 2.07(c), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

 

Section 2.08. _Withholding_. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as the Buyer is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. If the Buyer so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Seller in respect of which the Buyer made such deduction and
withholding to the extent such amounts are properly paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, and the Buyer shall furnish to such Seller
within 10 Business Days of such payment the original or certificated copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment. If the
Buyer intends to deduct or withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any of the Sellers under this Agreement pursuant to any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law other than such a provision related
to employment, compensation or U.S. federal backup withholding (within the
meaning of Section 3406 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder), the Buyer shall notify such Seller prior to the Closing of
its intention to withhold, which notice shall include a statement of the
amounts it intends to deduct or withhold in respect of making of such payment
and the applicable provision of law requiring the Buyer to withhold or deduct,
in each case thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, and shall reasonably
cooperate with such Seller to reduce or eliminate such deduction or
withholding.

the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments to the estimates made therein and the absence of footnotes).

of the Company Entities have been conducted in the ordinary course of business
in all material respects, and there has not been any action taken by any of

taken as a whole, (i) each Material Contract is a valid and binding agreement
of the applicable Company Entity and, to the knowledge of the Company, of
each other party thereto, and each such agreement is in full force and
effect, and (ii) none of the Company Entities or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any other party thereto is in default or breach under the terms of
any Material Contract, or has taken or failed to take any action that, with

2014, in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws and
regulations with respect to anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money

Section 3.13. _Registrations of the Company Entities and Employees_. (a) Each
of the Company Entities and, to the knowledge of the Company, each of the
Company Entities respective officers, directors, employees and "supervised
persons" (as such term is defined in the Investment Advisers Act), in their
capacities as such, which or who is required to be registered as an
investment adviser with the SEC or, except as would not reasonably be expected
to be material to the Company Entities, any other Governmental Authority, is
each duly registered as such, and each such registration is, and has been, in
the case of the Company Entities, from the time it became required to so
register, or, in the case of each of the Company Entities respective
directors, officers, employees and "supervised persons," to the knowledge of
the Company, since May 31, 2014 (or, if applicable, since such later time
when he or she became required to so register), in full force and effect and
in good standing in all material respects. There is no action, suit or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, any investigation
(formal or otherwise) pending or action, suit or proceeding threatened by any
Governmental Authority, that would reasonably be expected to lead to the
revocation, amendment, failure to renew, limitation, suspension or
restriction of any such material registration. Each of the Company Entities is
in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state, Self-
Regulatory Organization and foreign registration requirements and
such registrations as currently filed, and all periodic reports required to
be filed with respect thereto, are accurate and complete in all material
respects and no regulatory document contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

 



36 (b) (i) No Company Entity nor any director, officer, employee or "supervised
person" of any Company Entity that is, in each case, an "affiliated person"
(as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act) of any Company
Entity, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other Person that is such
an "affiliated person" of any Company Entity, is ineligible pursuant to
Section 9 of the Investment Company Act to serve as an investment adviser (or
in any other capacity described in Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of the
Investment Company Act) to a registered investment company; and (ii) no
Company Entity nor any director, officer, employee or "supervised person" of
any of the Company Entities that is, in each case, "associated" (as such term
is used in Section 202(a)(17) of the Investment Advisers Act) with any
Company Entity, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other Person that is
so "associated" with any Company Entity, is subject to potential
disqualification pursuant to Section 203(e) or 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act from serving as an investment adviser or as a person associated
with a registered investment adviser or subject to potential disqualification
under Rule 206(4)-3 under the Investment Advisers Act, except, in the case of
either clause (i) or (ii), for any such disqualification, (A) that would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company Entities or (B) with
respect to which any Company Entity or such "affiliated person" or "associated
person" has received exemptive relief from the SEC or any other applicable
Governmental Authority. There is no action, suit or proceeding, or
investigation (formal or otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, by any Governmental Authority that would result in any
such disqualification, except for any such disqualifications that would
not individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company Entities. Neither any Company Entity nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any Company Entities officers, directors, employees or
"supervised persons", are subject to a disqualifying event described under
Rule 506(d) of Regulation D of the Securities Act, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, there is no inquiry, investigation, proceeding or action pending
against any Company Entity or any of their officers, directors, employees or
"supervised persons" that would result in any of the disqualifying events
described under Rule 506(d) of Regulation D of the Securities Act.

 

(c) None of the Company Entities is, and is not required to be, registered as
a broker-dealer with the SEC or any other Governmental Authority or admitted
to membership in FINRA. Since May 31, 2014 (or, if applicable, since such
later time as required by Applicable Law), each employee, officer, director or
"supervised person" of any Company Entity required to be registered, licensed
or otherwise authorized as, or required to be subject to the supervision of, a
broker-dealer has such registration, license or other authorization, and is
under such supervision, in each case with respect to a broker-dealer duly
registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC or any other Governmental
Authority and admitted to membership in FINRA and the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation. No such employee, officer, director or "supervised
person" is, or since May 31, 2014, was, (A) ineligible to serve as an
associated person of a broker-dealer under Section 15(b) or 15(c) of the
Exchange Act, (B) subject to "statutory disqualification" (as defined in the
Exchange Act), or (C) subject to a disqualification that would be a basis for

 



37  censure, limitations on the activities, functions or operations of, or
suspension or revocation of the registration of such persons supervising
broker-dealer, nor is there any proceeding or investigation pending or, to

benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to Title I
of ERISA or Similar Law, (b) a Person acting on behalf of such a plan, (c)
a plan or arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the Code or (d) any Person
whose assets are deemed to be "plan assets" within the meaning of Department

investigation or voluntary fiduciary correction program with respect to any
Benefit Plan Client, except, in the case of clauses (x), (y) and (z), as would

Code, (ii) a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or

which remains unsatisfied, and no events have occurred and no circumstances
exist that could reasonably be expected to result in any such liability to
the Company Entities.

(d) No event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject any of
the Company Entities by reason of their affiliation with any ERISA Affiliate
to any material liability imposed by Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, in each case, in respect of any employee
benefit plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA maintained,
sponsored, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by any ERISA
Affiliate (other than the Company Entities).

such Employee Plan which could reasonably be expected to result in the loss
of such qualification or the determination letter not to be reissued. The
Company has made available to the Buyer copies of the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each such Employee Plan.
Each Employee Plan has been established, administered, maintained and funded
in material compliance with its terms and in all material respects with the

regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Employee Plan.

benefits) is pending against, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against, any Employee Plan before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental
Authority, including the IRS, the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation.

security payment or benefit) under any Employee Plan or other arrangement
creating post-Closing obligations of any of the Company Entities, or (ii)

compensation or benefits, or increase the amount payable or trigger any other
obligation to any current or former employee of any of the Company Entities

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with
any other event) will result in the payment of any amount that would,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

benefits except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code and Section

"continuation coverage requirement" of "group health plans" as set forth in
Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
with respect to any Employee Plan to which such continuation coverage
requirements apply.

(j) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in material documentary
compliance with, and has been administered in material compliance with Section
409A of the Code. No person is entitled to receive any additional payment
(including any tax gross-up or other payment) from the Company Entities as a
result of the imposition of the excise taxes required by Section 4999 of the
Code or any taxes required by Section 409A of the Code.

(k) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company Entities, taken as a whole, all Employee

Section 5.04. _Noncontravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the Buyers or Merger Subs
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, as applicable.

Section 5.06. _Certain Regulatory Matters_. (a) (i) Neither the Buyer, nor
Merger Sub, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
"supervised persons" that is, in each case, an "affiliated person" (as defined
in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act) of the Buyer or Merger Sub,
nor, to the knowledge of the Buyer, any other Person that is such an
"affiliated person" of the Buyer or Merger Sub, is ineligible pursuant to
Section 9 of the Investment Company Act to serve as an investment adviser (or
in any other capacity described in Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of the Investment
Company Act) to a registered investment company; and (ii) neither the Buyer,
Merger Sub, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
"supervised persons" that is, in each case, "associated" (as such term is used
in Section 202(a)(17) of the Investment Advisers Act) with the Buyer or Merger
Sub, nor, to the knowledge of the Buyer, any other Person that is so
"associated" with the Buyer or Merger Sub, is subject to disqualification
pursuant to Section 203(e) or (f) of the Investment Advisers Act from serving

material to the Buyer or Merger Sub or (B) with respect to which the Buyer,
Merger Sub or such "affiliated person" or "associated person" has
received exemptive relief from the SEC or any other applicable Governmental
Authority. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation (formal or
otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the Buyer, threatened, by any
Governmental Authority that would result in any such disqualification, except
for any such disqualifications that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Buyer or Merger Sub.

 



51 (b) None of the Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their "affiliated persons" (as
defined in the Investment Company Act) has any express or implied
understanding or arrangements which would reasonably be expected to impose an
"unfair burden" (as defined in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) on
any Registered Fund as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or
which would in any way violate, or otherwise make unavailable to the Company
or the Sellers, Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act.

 

Section 5.07. ___Financing_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Buyer has
received an executed debt commitment letter dated the date hereof, including
all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto and any associated fee letter (the
"Debt Commitment Letter") from Barclays and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Inc. (collectively, "Lender"), pursuant to which Lender has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to the Buyer
the amount of financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Debt
Financing"), for the Financing Purposes. A true and complete copy of the Debt
Commitment Letter has been previously provided to the Company (it being
understood that such Debt Commitment Letter has been redacted in a customary
manner, to omit the fee amounts and the flex provisions provided therein and
other information customarily redacted in such Debt Commitment Letter). The
Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date hereof under the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter and will pay all
additional fees to be paid under the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or
any related fee letter as they become due. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Buyer
and, to the knowledge of the Buyer, each other party thereto, except as the
same may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions, and in full force and
effect, has not been amended, modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in
any respect, and does not contain any material misrepresentation by the Buyer
or Merger Sub and no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach
thereunder on the part of the Buyer or Merger Sub. As of the date hereof, no
amendment or modification to, or withdrawal, termination or rescission of, the
Debt Commitment Letter is contemplated. The aggregate proceeds contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, together with available cash of the Buyer and
Merger Sub, will be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to satisfy all
of the obligations of the Buyer and Merger Sub under this Agreement, including
(x) paying the Purchase Price at and after Closing, (y) effecting the
repayment or refinancing of all Closing Indebtedness as of the Closing Date
and (z) paying all fees and expenses payable hereunder or under the Debt
Commitment Letter (collectively, the "Financing Purposes"). As of the date
hereof, neither the Buyer nor Merger Sub has incurred any obligation,
commitment, restriction or liability of any kind, and neither of them is
contemplating or aware of any obligation, commitment, restriction or liability
of any kind, in either case which would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the availability of the Debt Financing. Except for the fee letter
referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter, as of the date hereof, there are no
side letters or other agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings
related to the funding or investing, as applicable of the Debt Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the applicable Debt

 



52  Commitment Letter, that could adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability or availability of the Debt Financing. Neither the fee letter
between the Buyer and Lender referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter nor
any other contract between Lender, on the one hand, and the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, contains any conditions precedent or other
contingencies (x) related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing or any provisions that could reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or (y) that could otherwise
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability or availability of the
Debt Commitment Letter with respect to all or any portion of the Debt
Financing. As of the date hereof, neither the Buyer nor Merger Sub has any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing would not
reasonably be expected to be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Debt
Financing would not reasonably be expected to be available to the Buyer and
Merger Sub on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to Section
2.04. Each of the Buyer and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that
its obligations hereunder, including its obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, are not subject to, or conditioned
upon, receipt of financing.

Section 5.08. _Solvency_. (a) Neither the Buyer nor Merger Sub is entering
into this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with the intent
to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. Assuming (i)
the satisfaction of the conditions to the Buyers obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the accuracy in all material respects
of the representations and warranties set forth in Articles 3 and 4 and the
performance of the Company of its obligations hereunder in all respects, (iii)
that the Company is Solvent as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
before giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) that
any estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans of the Company that have been provided to the Buyer prior to the date
hereof were prepared based upon assumptions that were, at the time made, and
continue to be, reasonable, and, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by hereby, including the Debt Financing, any
Alternative Financing, the payment of the Purchase Price, any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letters and the payment of all related fees and expenses, the Buyer on a
consolidated basis will be Solvent as of the Closing and immediately after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Solvent" when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including reasonably
anticipated contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including reasonably anticipated contingent liabilities) as
such debts become absolute and matured, (ii) such Person will not have, as of
such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including
reasonably anticipated contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

 



53 Section 5.09. _Purchase for Investment_. The Buyer is purchasing or otherwise
acquiring the Remaining Company Equity Interests for investment for its own
account and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof. The Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the Remaining Company Equity Interests and is
capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.

 

Section 5.10. _Finders_ __ _Fees_. Except for Barclays Capital Inc. and
Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC (whose fees and expenses will be paid by the Buyer),
there is no financial advisor, investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
the Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates that is entitled
to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Section 5.11. _Inspections; No Other Representations and Warranties_. (a) Each
of the Buyer and Merger Sub is an informed and sophisticated purchaser, and
has engaged expert advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of
companies such as the Company Entities as contemplated hereunder and has
undertaken such investigation and has been provided with and evaluated such
documents and information as each of the Buyer and Merger Sub has deemed
necessary.

(b) Each of the Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledges that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article 3 and Article 4,
none of the Sellers, the Seller Representative, the Company Entities or their
respective Related Parties has made or is making any express or
implied representation or warranty of any nature to the Buyer, Merger Sub or
their respective Related Parties, at law or in equity, with respect to matters
relating to the Sellers, the Seller Representative, the Company Entities,
their respective Related Parties, their respective businesses or any other
matter related to or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
and each of the Buyer and Merger Sub hereby expressly disclaims reliance on
any such other representations or warranties (including as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information provided to the Buyer or Merger Sub). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Buyer and Merger Sub
acknowledges that none of the Sellers, the Seller Representative, the Company
Entities or their respective Related Parties has made or is making any
representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections, estimates or
budgets delivered to or made available to the Buyer, Merger Sub or their
respective Related Parties of future revenues, future results of operations
(or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition
(or any component thereof) of the Company Entities or the future business and
operations of the Company Entities or (ii) any other information or documents
made available to the Buyer, Merger Sub or their respective Related Parties
with respect to the Company Entities or their respective businesses or
operations (including as to the accuracy or completeness of any such
information or documents), except as expressly set forth in Article 3 and
Article 4.

Buyer shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

Section 6.03. _Client Consents_. (a) _ Registered Funds_. (i) For each
Sponsored Registered Fund, the Company shall, and shall cause the other
Company Entities to, subject to their fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following
the date hereof, (A) the approval by the Fund Board of such Sponsored
Registered Fund ("Board Approval") of the reorganization, on reasonable and
customary terms and conditions, in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Schedule E_ (the "Plan of Reorganization"), as modified in accordance with
Section 6.03(a)(iii), of such Sponsored Fund into the series and classes of
Virtus Asset Trust, a Delaware Statutory trust ("Virtus Asset Trust" and each,
a "VF Series"), set forth next to the name of such Sponsored Registered Fund
on Section 6.03(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (as may be updated or
amended prior to the Closing Date as mutually agreed by the Company and the
Buyer) (each, a "Fund Reorganization") and (B) except for any Sponsored
Registered Fund with respect to which approval of the Registered Funds
shareholders is not required to implement such Fund Reorganization, the
approval of the shareholders of the Sponsored Registered Fund ("Shareholder
Approval") of the foregoing. For each such Sponsored Registered Fund, the
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, subject to their fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the approval, to the extent
required to effect any Fund Reorganization, of the board of trustees of Virtus
Asset Trust (the "VF Board"), of the Fund Reorganization. Further, the Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the VF Series that is the party
to such Sponsored Funds proposed Fund Reorganization to prepare and to file
with the SEC (to the extent such filing is required) as promptly as
practicable all securities registration statements and prospectuses and proxy
solicitation materials necessary to comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act, Section 14 of the Exchange Act
and Section 20 of the Investment Company Act, including a securities
registration statement on SEC Form N-14 (or successor form thereto) containing
a joint proxy statement and prospectus (a "Fund Reorganization Proxy
Statement/Prospectus"), and the Company shall, upon the reasonable request of
the Buyer, provide to the Buyer any information that is required to be
included in any 

 



59  Fund Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Consistent with its
obligations under the first sentence of this Section 6.03(a)(i), the Company
shall, and shall cause the other Company Entities to, use their reasonable
best efforts to cause each such Sponsored Fund (A) to mail such Fund
Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the shareholders of such
Sponsored Fund as promptly as practicable after clearance by the SEC and (B)
as soon as practicable following the mailing of such proxy solicitation
materials (but in no event earlier than 20 Business Days following such
mailing), submit such Fund Reorganization for Shareholder Approval. Buyer
covenants that each VF Series shall be a newly formed series of Virtus Asset
Trust formed for the purpose of effecting the Fund Reorganization and, prior
to effecting the applicable Fund Reorganization, shall have conducted no
material activities other than in connection with effecting such Fund
Reorganization.

(ii) For (A) each Sponsored Registered Fund (1) in respect of which
the approval of the shareholders of the corresponding VF Series would be
required to effect the applicable Fund Reorganization, (2) in respect of which
the VF Board has failed to provide the approvals required of it, or the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries have failed to take the actions to be taken by the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries necessary, to proceed with the Fund Reorganization in a
timely manner in light of the transactions contemplated hereby or the proposed
plan of reorganization for such Sponsored Registered Fund deviates materially
in a manner not reasonably acceptable to the Company from the Plan of
Reorganization, (3) in respect of which the VF Board has terminated the
respective Plan of Reorganization or (4) in respect of which the
corresponding VF Series (I) except as disclosed on Section 6.03(a)(ii)(A)(4)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, does not have the same investment adviser
(and sub-adviser, if any) and substantially the same investment team,
investment strategy and investment policies as such Sponsored Registered Fund
(for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (1) shall not apply to the
voluntary departure of one or more members of a portfolio manager team for a
Sponsored Registered Fund), or (II) has higher investment advisory fees or
higher aggregate non-investment advisory fees or expenses than such Sponsored
Registered Fund taking into account, in the case of non-investment advisory
fees and expenses, any fee waivers or expense reimbursement agreements
applicable to such Sponsored Registered Fund or such VF Series (it being
agreed that the Buyer shall maintain all fee waivers or expense reimbursement
agreements necessary to ensure that the net fees and expenses of any VF Series
do not increase for at least two years following the Closing Date), and (B)
each Registered Fund that is not a Sponsored Fund, in each case, the Company
shall, and shall cause the other Company Entities to, subject to their
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to obtain,
as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, (1) Board Approval of a
new Advisory Contract for such Registered Fund with the applicable Company
Entity, to be entered into as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and not including an "interim contract" pursuant to Rule 15a-4
under the Investment Company Act) (a "New Registered Fund Advisory Contract")
and (2) except for any Registered Fund with respect to which approval of the
Registered Funds shareholders is not required to implement such New
Registered Fund Advisory Contract, Shareholder Approval of such New Registered
Fund Advisory Contract.

 



60 (iii) The Buyer shall cooperate with the Company Entities in connection with
the foregoing provisions of Sections 6.03(a)(i) and (ii) including in any
communications or presentations by any of the Company Entities to any Fund
Board, any shareholders of a Registered Fund or the VF Board and by providing
any information reasonably requested by a Company Entity. Further, the
parties shall promptly provide to any Fund Board or the VF Board all
information relating to such party and its Affiliates as is necessary or
reasonably requested by such Fund Board or the VF Board to enable it to
evaluate the terms of each applicable Fund Reorganization or, as applicable,
New Registered Fund Advisory Contract, or other arrangements proposed, or
consent requested, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and relating to such Registered Fund or a VF Series. The Buyer
and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate and each use its reasonable best efforts to (1) cause the
reorganization or similar agreements required to effect each Fund
Reorganization to be negotiated and agreed upon on reasonable and customary
terms, including such reasonable and customary terms as may be negotiated and
agreed by counsel to each of the Fund Board of a Sponsored Registered Fund,
the VF Board and their respective independent directors, that are
substantially similar to the Plan of Reorganization, and (2) obtain the
approvals of the relevant Fund Board or the VF Board, as applicable, to
any related matters which may be advisable in connection therewith (including
any matters reasonably requested by the Company, the Buyer, such Fund Board or
the VF Board); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, any such agreement
may not and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the respective rights,
entitlements and liabilities among the parties hereto under the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(iv) In the event that (1) Shareholder Approval (or VF Board approval, to the
extent required) of a Fund Reorganization or New Registered Fund Advisory
Contract, as the case may be, in respect of a Registered Fund has not been
obtained, or is reasonably likely not to be obtained, by or before the Closing
Date or (2) Shareholder Approval (and VF Board approval, to the extent
required) of a Fund Reorganization has been obtained but such Fund
Reorganization is not reasonably expected to take place concurrently with the
Closing, (A) the parties shall cooperate to use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain the approval of the respective Fund Board of an "interim contract"
pursuant to Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act so as to permit the
applicable Company Entity to continue to serve as investment adviser to such
Registered Fund for the longest period permitted by Applicable Law following
the Closing and (B) following the Closing, the Buyer and the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such
Shareholder Approval prior to the True-Up Date. A Registered Fund that is
subject to an interim approval under this Section 6.03(a)(iv) and that has not
obtained Shareholder Approval shall not be deemed a "Consenting Client" or a
"Late Consenting Client" until such time as a Shareholder Approval is received
with respect to such Registered Fund as contemplated under Section 6.03(a)(i)
or (ii), as applicable.

 



61 (v) The Buyer shall, on a timely basis, use its reasonable best efforts and
shall reasonably cooperate with the Company to ensure that, with respect to
each Fund Reorganization contemplated by this Section 6.03(a), (A) the
respective VF Series and the requisite investment advisers and other service
providers thereto are in each case properly organized and formed and have the
requisite regulatory approvals and registrations to enable the Fund
Reorganization to occur by the Closing, (B) in coordination with the Company
Entities and with their reasonable best efforts and cooperation, there are in
place distribution or other arrangements necessary to allow shareholders of
the respective Sponsored Registered Fund, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, beneficial shareholders, to hold their shares in such
Sponsored Registered Fund, until and immediately after the closing of the
respective Fund Reorganization, without increased cost or expense, and (C) all
of the closing conditions to the consummation of each Fund Reorganization are
timely satisfied or reasonably waived.

(vi) The Company Entities and the Buyer shall, on a timely basis, use their
reasonable best efforts and cooperate to ensure that each VF Series has in
place the distribution or other arrangements necessary to allow the
shareholders of the respective Sponsored Registered Fund (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, beneficial shareholders) to continue to hold their shares
in such VF Series following the applicable Fund Reorganization.

(vii) With respect to each Sponsored Registered Fund, Buyer (A) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to put into place financial intermediary relationships
(such as shareholder servicing, sub-transfer agent or distribution
relationships) for the respective VF Series with each of the financial
intermediaries set forth on Section 6.03(a)(vii)(A) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and the Company Entities shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Buyer in this respect, (B) to the extent such terms are not in
place as a consequence of the completion of the applicable Fund
Reorganization, shall propose to such financial intermediaries economic terms
with respect to such VF Series that are no less favorable (in the aggregate)
than the economic terms such financial intermediaries currently receive with
respect to such Sponsored Registered Fund and (C) shall not propose (and shall
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that Virtus Asset Trust and the
VF Series do not propose) less favorable economic terms (in the aggregate) to
any of the financial intermediaries set forth on Section 6.03(a)(vii)(C) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Buyers obligations under this Section
6.03(a)(vii) shall terminate upon the first Business Day after the Closing
Date, provided that if the Final Closing Revenue Run Rate Adjustment is not
zero, then (1) with respect to any financial intermediary described in clause
(A) or (C) above that provides services to any Sponsored Registered Fund that
was not a Consenting Client as of the Closing Date, such obligations shall
terminate only upon the earlier of (x) the date each such Sponsored Registered
Fund becomes a Consenting Client and (y) the first Business Day after the
True-

 



62  Up Date and (2) such obligations shall terminate on the first Business Day
after sufficient Clients that were not Consenting Clients as of the Closing
Date have become Late Consenting Clients such that, or the Buyer otherwise
irrevocably agrees in writing that, the True-Up Revenue Run Rate Adjustment
will be equal to zero. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be
prohibited by the foregoing provision from agreeing to economic terms with
any financial intermediary that are less favorable to such financial
intermediary than the economic terms such financial intermediary currently
receives with respect to such Sponsored Registered Fund, provided that the
change to such economic terms is not initiated by Buyer, Virtus Asset Trust or
any VF Series.

 

(viii) With respect to any Sponsored Registered Fund, if (A) prior to the
Closing (or prior to the True-Up Date in the case of a Sponsored Registered
Fund that was not a Consenting Client as of the Closing Date), Buyer, any of
its Affiliates, Virtus Asset Trust or any VF Series (or any of the Company
Entities at their request) (I) liquidates, or announces its intention to
liquidate, such Sponsored Registered Fund, (II) terminates, or announces the
termination of, the investment adviser, sub-adviser (if any) or one or more
members of the portfolio management team (unless such team would still be
substantially the same following such termination) of such Sponsored
Registered Fund (or, for the avoidance of doubt, merges or reorganizes, or
announces the merger or reorganization, of such Sponsored Registered Fund
into a VF Series or other fund that does not have the same investment adviser,
sub-adviser (if any) and substantially the same portfolio management team as
such Sponsored Registered Fund), or (III) merges or reorganizes, or announces
its intention to merge or reorganize, such Sponsored Registered Fund into a
fund that has already commenced operations, then (B) notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, for all purposes hereunder (including the
calculation of Closing Revenue Run Rate and Adjusted Closing Revenue Run
Rate), such Sponsored Registered Fund shall be deemed to be a Consenting
Client (or a Late Consenting Client in the case of a Sponsored Registered
Fund that was not a Consenting Client (including pursuant to this sentence) as
of the Closing Date) with a Revenue Run Rate and an AUM equal to its Revenue
Run Rate and AUM as of the Base Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not apply to (i) the merger or reorganization of more than one
Sponsored Registered Fund into a single VF Series if such VF Series will have
the same investment adviser (and sub-adviser, if any) and substantially the
same investment team, investment strategy and investment policies as each such
Sponsored Registered Fund, and the merger or reorganization of any one such
Sponsored Registered Fund into such VF Series is not a condition to the
closing of the merger or reorganization of any other such Sponsored Registered
Fund into such VF Series, (ii) the merger or reorganization of a Sponsored
Registered Fund and an existing open-end, Investment Company Act-registered
investment company sponsored by Buyer into a VF Series if such VF Series will
have the same investment adviser (and sub-adviser, if any) and substantially
the same investment team, investment strategy and investment policies as such
Sponsored Registered Fund, and the merger or reorganization of such existing
open-end, Investment Company Act-registered investment company

 



63  sponsored by Buyer into such VF Series is not a condition to the closing of
the merger or reorganization of such Sponsored Registered Fund into such VF
Series or (iii) the voluntary departure of one or more members of a portfolio
manager team for a Sponsored Registered Fund. In addition, each Sponsored
Registered Fund set forth on Section 6.03(a)(ii)(A)(4) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and denoted thereon with the word "frozen" shall also be
deemed to be a Consenting Client with a Revenue Run Rate and an AUM equal to
its Revenue Run Rate and AUM as of the Base Date.

 

(b) _Other Clients_. (i)The Company shall, and shall cause the other Company
Entities to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof, Client Consents in respect of all
Clients that are not Registered Funds.

 

(ii) In furtherance of the Companys obligations under Section 6.03(b)(i),
with respect to each Advisory Contract for which the consent of the
applicable Client (other than a Registered Fund) to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Advisory Contract as a result of the change of control of
the applicable Company Entity contemplated hereby (each, a "Client Consent")
is required pursuant to Applicable Law or by the terms of such Advisory
Contract, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, or shall cause the applicable Company Entity to, send a
written notice informing each such Client of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and requesting affirmative written consent to the assignment or
deemed assignment of the applicable Advisory Contract(s). With respect to each
Direct Client, Collective Trust Client, Sub-Advised Private Fund and Open-End
Private Fund the parties agree that Client Consent in respect of any such
Client shall be deemed given, and such Client deemed a Consenting Client, for
all purposes of this Agreement if (x) written consent is received from such
Client or (y) such written consent has not been received prior to the Closing
Date, if, in the case of this clause (y), (A) the Advisory Contract in
respect of such Client does not expressly require the Clients written consent
to the assignment of such Advisory Contract; (B) such Client is sent a notice
(the "Negative Consent Notice"), which notice may be included in the notice
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, informing such Client, to
the extent appropriate: (1) of the applicable Company Entitys intention to
complete the change of control of such Company Entity contemplated hereby,
which will result in an assignment or a deemed assignment, as the case may be,
of such Clients Advisory Contract (or other consequences triggering a consent
requirement under Applicable Law in the case of such Client), (2) of the
applicable Company Entitys intention to continue to provide advisory services
pursuant to such Advisory Contract after the Closing if such Client does not
terminate such Advisory Contract prior to the Closing, and (3) that the
consent of such Client will be deemed to have been granted if such Client
continues to accept such advisory services for a period of at least 45 days
after the sending of the Negative Consent Notice without termination; (C)
such 45-day period has expired at least two Business Days prior to the
Applicable Measurement Date; and (D) such Client has not, at any time prior to
the Closing Date, terminated its Advisory Contract or notified the applicable
Company Entity in writing that such Client has not consented or is terminating
its Advisory Contract or is withdrawing the entire balance of its account with
the applicable Company Entity;  _provided_ , that each such Client that has
not provided affirmative written consent within 30 days after delivery of the
Negative Consent Notice shall be sent a second Negative Consent Notice.

 



64 (iii) For purposes of Section 6.03(b)(ii) above, in the case of each
Collective Trust Client, Sub-Advised Private Fund and Open-End Private Fund,
the Client shall be deemed to be the trustee, general partner, managing member
or equivalent governing body of such Private Fund (or in the case of a Sub-
Advised Private Fund, the third-party adviser party to the Advisory Contract
in respect of such Sub-Advised Private Fund). As such, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Client Consent with respect to each
Collective Trust Client, Sub-Advised Private Fund and Open-End Private Fund
shall be deemed given, and such Private Fund deemed a Consenting Client, for
all purposes of this Agreement if the trustee, general partner, managing
member or equivalent governing body of such Private Fund (or in the case of a
Sub-Advised Private Fund, the third-party adviser party to the Advisory
Contract in respect of such Sub-Advised Private Fund) consents (or is deemed
to have consented) pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(ii) (including pursuant to the
second sentence in Section 6.03(b)(ii)) to the assignment or deemed assignment
of the respective Advisory Contract as a result of the change of control of
the applicable Company Entity contemplated hereby.

(iv) In furtherance of the Companys obligations under Section 6.03(b)(i)
above, with respect to each Closed-End Private Funds Advisory Contract(s) or
Fund Agreement for which the Client Consent of a general partner (or
equivalent thereof) or some percentage of the Private Funds board
of directors, advisory committee or investors is required by the terms of
such Advisory Contract, the Fund Agreement or Applicable Law in connection
with the assignment or deemed assignment of such Advisory Contract or Fund
Agreement as a result of the change of control of the applicable Company
Entity contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following
the date hereof, the Company shall, or shall cause the applicable Company
Entity to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain such Client Consent in
accordance with such Advisory Contract, such Fund Agreement or Applicable Law.

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that
with respect to each Client that receives Investment Services from any of the
Company Entities through a separately managed account opened through a broker-
dealer or other financial institution as part of a "SMA," "UMA," "wrap-fee"
or similar program sponsored by such broker-dealer or other financial
institution (each, a "Platform Client" and "Platform Program," respectively),
Client Consent in respect of such Platform Client shall be deemed given, and
such Platform Client shall be deemed to be a Consenting Client, for all
purposes of this Agreement, (A) if such broker-dealer or other financial
institution (a "Platform Sponsor") has consented to the assignment or deemed
assignment of the contract in respect of such Platform Program between such
broker-dealer or other financial 

 



65  institution and the applicable Company Entity (the "Platform Contract"), as
a result of the change of control of the applicable Company Entity
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with, and only to the extent
required by, the terms of such Platform Contract, and such consent has not
been revoked, or such Platform Contract terminated, in writing by such broker-
dealer or other financial institution prior to the Closing Date, and, (B) if
and only if the consent of such Platform Client itself is also required under
the terms of the applicable Platform Program, the consent of such Platform
Client to the assignment or deemed assignment of its investment advisory
relationship with the applicable Company Entity has been obtained in
accordance with the process for obtaining such consents utilized by the
applicable Platform Sponsor (including pursuant to a negative or deemed
consent process) and such Platform Client has not in writing, at any time
prior to the Closing Date, terminated its investment advisory relationship
with the applicable Company Entity or notified the applicable Company Entity
that such Client has not consented or is terminating such investment advisory
relationship. The parties further agree that any Platform Client that is not a
Consenting Client as of the Closing Date shall be deemed a Late Consenting
Client for all purposes under this Agreement if the consents contemplated by
the immediately preceding sentence are obtained in respect of such Client
during the True-Up Period.

 

(vi) With respect to any Client (other than a Registered Fund) that becomes a
Client after the date hereof, Client Consent in respect of any such Client
shall be deemed given, and such Client deemed a Consenting Client, for all
purposes of this Agreement if written disclosure in reasonable detail (in the
Advisory Contract or otherwise) of the change of control of the applicable
Company Entity contemplated by this Agreement is provided to such Client (or,
in the case of a Sponsored Private Fund, the investors therein) prior to such
Client becoming a Client.

 

(vii) In the event that Client Consent in respect of any Client that is not a
Registered Fund has not been obtained by the Closing Date, following the
Closing, Buyer, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Client Consent prior to the
True-Up Date.

 

(viii) At least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, pursuant
to and in accordance with each of the collateral management agreements set
forth on Section 6.03(b)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a
"CMA"), the Company shall cause Seix Investment Advisors LLC, as collateral
manager under each CMA, to deliver to the applicable trustee the written
notice set forth on Section 6.03(b)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) _Expenses_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement, any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees or expenses
incurred by the Company Entities or the Buyer prior to the Closing Date
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the 

 



66  Sponsored Registered Funds or the VF Series prior to the Closing Date that
are reimbursable by the Company Entities or the Buyer) in connection with
seeking and obtaining consents in compliance with this Section 6.03 (and, if
the Final Closing Revenue Run Rate Adjustment is not zero, any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company Entities
or the Buyer after the Closing Date and prior to the True-Up Date in
connection with seeking and obtaining consent in compliance with this Section
6.03 for any Client that was not a Consenting Client as of the Closing Date
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by any Sponsored Registered Fund that was not a
Consenting Client as of the Closing Date or the corresponding VF Series after
the Closing Date and prior to the True-Up Date that are reimbursable by the
Company Entities or the Buyer)) (including, in each case, Fund Reorganization
Proxy Statement/Prospectus preparation and mailing, solicitation expenses, any
applicable fund liquidation costs and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
legal expenses, but excluding the costs of the formation and registration of
Virtus Asset Trust and each VF Series) shall be borne equally by the Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, and to the extent (i) the
Buyer does not pay its share of such fees and expenses at or prior to the
Closing, the Company shall be deemed to have a current asset in the amount of
the Buyers share of such unpaid fees and expenses for purposes of
calculating Closing Working Capital hereunder and (ii) the Companys share of
such fees and expenses exceeds the amount of such fees and expenses included
in Closing Transaction Expenses, such excess shall (A) be first deducted from
any amount otherwise due to the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.07(d) and then
paid to the Buyer out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund or, (B) if no amount is due
to the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.07(d), such excess shall be paid to the
Buyer out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

(d) _Efforts of Parties_. All actions by the Company and the Buyer required
by this Section 6.03 shall be undertaken by the applicable party as promptly
as practicable following the date of this Agreement. The Buyer covenants and
agrees that, except to the extent it relates to the Company or with respect
to information provided by the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein (to which extent no representation by Buyer
is made), each Fund Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus will not, at the
time of the mailing of such document or any amendments or supplements
thereto, or at the time of the shareholders meeting held in relation thereto,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and will
contain all information necessary in order to make the disclosure of
information therein satisfy the requirements of Applicable Law in
all material respects. The Company covenants and agrees that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of the Company
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in a Fund
Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the time of the mailing of
such document or any amendments or supplements thereto, or at the time of the
shareholders meeting held in relation thereto, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company and the
Buyer covenant and agree that any information that is supplied, sent or
given, or included in any document supplied,

 



67  sent or given, by any of them to any Client (other than any Fund
Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus) for the purposes of obtaining the
requisite consent or approval or, if applicable, informing any Client of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be true, complete and
accurate in all material respects and, at the time such information is sent or
given, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Buyer shall be provided a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all consent materials to be
used by the Company in connection with their obligations under this Section
6.03 prior to distribution, and the Company should consider in good faith all
such comments. The Company shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on all consent materials to be used by the Buyer in
connection with their obligations under this Section 6.03 prior to
distribution (including materials to be provided to the VF Board and the Fund
Reorganization Proxy Statement/Prospectus), and the Buyer should consider in
good faith all such comments. The Company shall, or shall cause the other
Company Entities to, regularly provide the Buyer with updates and material
information relating to the status of the consent solicitation provided for in
this Section 6.03. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the "reasonable best
efforts" of the parties under this Section 6.03 shall not require any party
to offer or grant any fee or other concession to a Client or any other third
party.

Section 6.04.  _Section_ __ _ 15(f) of the Investment Company Act_. (a) The
Buyer acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
intended to qualify for the treatment described in Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act. Prior to the Closing Date, each of the parties shall
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure compliance with Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act so that such transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be in compliance with Section 15(f) of the Investment Company
Act at the Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the businesses of the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries to comply with the conditions of Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act in respect of the Registered Funds (and any VF Series
into which a Sponsored Registered Fund has been reorganized), including to
ensure that:

 

(i) to the extent reasonably within its control, for a period of three years
after the Closing Date, at least 75% of the members of the Fund Board of each
Sponsored Registered Fund (and of the board of each such VF Series) shall not
be (A) "interested persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the
Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries or the investment adviser of such
Sponsored Registered Fund (or such VF Series) after the Closing or (B)
"interested persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Company
or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing; and

 

(ii) for a period of two years after the Closing Date, there shall not be
imposed on any Registered Fund (or any such VF Series) an "unfair burden"
(within the meaning of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any terms,
conditions or understandings applicable hereto and thereto; 

 



68 _provided,_ that if the Buyer or its Affiliates obtain an order from the SEC
exempting it from the provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company
Act while still maintaining the "safe harbor" provided by Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act with respect to the Registered Funds (and any such VF
Series), then this covenant shall be deemed to be modified to the extent
necessary to permit the Buyer and its Affiliates to act in a manner consistent
with such SEC exemptive order.

 

(b) For a period of three years from the Closing Date, neither the Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates shall voluntarily engage in any transaction that would
constitute an "assignment" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) to a
third party of any New Registered Fund Advisory Contract (or any successor or
replacement advisory contract to any Registered Fund) or any
advisory contract pursuant to which the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
renders Investment Services to a VF Series that was a party to a Fund
Reorganization without first obtaining a covenant in all material respects
comparable to that contained in this Section 6.04.

Section 6.05. _Access to Information_. (a) From the date hereof through the
Closing Date, subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company shall, upon the Buyers reasonable request, (i) give, and cause
the other Company Entities to give, the Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and records of the
Company Entities, (ii) furnish, and cause the other Company Entities to
furnish, to the Buyer and its Representatives financial and operating data and
other information relating to the Company Entities and (iii) instruct its and
the other Company Entities Representatives to cooperate with the Buyer in its
investigation of the Company Entities. From the date hereof through the
Closing Date, without the Companys prior written consent (which, except in
connection with contacts with any institutional Clients, shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, contact any Clients, vendors, suppliers or
other third parties having business relationships with the Company Entities,
other than (A) in the ordinary course of the Buyers and its Affiliates
business consistent with past practice, so long as any such contact does not
relate to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and is
otherwise conducted in compliance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and (B) in connection with actions required by Sections
6.03(a)(v)-(viii) ( _provided_ that, in connection with any such actions, the
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, in each case to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with the Company prior to taking such
actions).

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall preserve and keep, or
cause to be preserved and kept, the books and records that relate to the
businesses of the Company Entities prior to the Closing for a period of five
years after the Closing Date, and subject to Applicable Law, upon the
reasonable request of the Seller Representative or any other Seller, (i)
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, give the Seller Representative or
such Seller, as applicable, and their respective Representatives reasonable
access to such books and records relating to the businesses of the Company
Entities prior to the Closing and (ii) the Buyer shall, and shall cause each
of the Company Entities to, give the Seller Representative or such Seller, as
applicable, and their respective Representatives reasonable access to the
Company Entities Representatives, 

 



69  and instruct such Representatives to cooperate with the Seller
Representative or such Seller, as applicable, in the case of each of clauses
(i) and (ii), to the extent that the Seller Representative or such Seller, as
applicable, reasonably deems necessary or desirable in order to determine any
matter relating to its rights and obligations hereunder or otherwise in
connection with tax, regulatory, litigation, contractual or other legitimate
matters. The Seller Representative and each Seller shall hold, and instruct
their respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence, unless
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of Applicable Law, all confidential documents and information
concerning any Company Entity provided to it pursuant to this Section 6.05(b).

 

(c) Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be conducted during
normal business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably
with the conduct of the business of the applicable party, the Company Entities
or their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Section 6.05 shall require any party, the other
Company Entities or their respective Affiliates to disclose or provide any
other party with access to (i) any personnel records relating to individual
performance or evaluations, medical histories or other information that in the
disclosing partys good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which
would subject the disclosing party or its Affiliates to risk of liability or
(ii) any information the disclosure of which would, in the disclosing partys
good faith opinion, reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the disclosing party or its Affiliates or violate any Applicable
Law.

 

Section 6.06. _Notices of Certain Events_. Prior to the Closing, each of the
parties shall promptly notify each other of (a) any written notice or other
written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) any written notice or other written communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (c) any action, suit, investigation or proceeding commenced
involving such party or its Affiliates that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed; and (d) any
occurrence of which it is aware that is reasonably likely to result in any of
the conditions set forth in Article 9 becoming incapable of being
satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a partys good
faith failure to comply with this Section 6.06 or Section 6.12 shall not
provide any other party the right not to effect the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except to the extent that any other provision of this
Agreement would independently provide such right.

Section 6.07. _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, the parties agree
to consult with one another before issuing any press release or making any
other public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public announcement
the issuance or making of which is required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange, shall not issue
any such press release or make any such other public statement without the
prior written consent of the other parties.

 



70 Section 6.08. _No Negotiations_. The Company agrees that between the date
hereof and the Closing, or the earlier valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (a) solicit, knowingly encourage or
initiate the submission of proposals or offers from, (b) provide any
confidential information to, or (c) participate in discussions or negotiations
or enter into any agreement with, any Person (other than the Buyer and its
Affiliates) concerning the sale of the Company to such Person.

Section 6.09. _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_. (a) Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Company, and the Surviving Company hereby agrees,
that for six years after the Closing, the Surviving Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless all Persons who at or prior to the Closing were
directors, managers or officers of any Company Entity (each, an "Indemnified
Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing,
and shall advance expenses to Indemnified Persons in respect of any claims,
actions, suits or other proceedings relating to any such acts or omissions,
in each case to the fullest extent provided under the governing documents of
the Company Entities or the Sellers, as applicable, on the date hereof;
_provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by Applicable Law.
The Buyer hereby agrees that the Surviving Company is the indemnitor of first
resort (i.e., its obligations to any Indemnified Person under this Agreement
are primary and any obligation of any Seller or any Affiliate thereof to
provide indemnification or advancement of expenses for the same matters are
secondary), and if any Seller or any Affiliate thereof pays any
amount otherwise indemnifiable hereunder with any Indemnified Person, then
such Seller or Affiliate thereof shall be subrogated to the rights of the
Indemnified Person hereunder with respect to such payment, and the Surviving
Company shall reimburse such Seller or Affiliate thereof for such payment.

(b) The Buyer agrees that (i) the governing documents of the Surviving Company
and the other Company Entities after the Closing shall contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable to the beneficiaries of such
provisions as those provisions that are set forth in the governing documents
of the Company Entities on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years following
the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any Indemnified Person except to the extent that such modification is
required by Applicable Law and (ii) all rights to indemnification as provided
in any indemnification agreements between any Company Entity, on the
one hand, and any Indemnified Person, on the other hand, as in effect as of
the date hereof with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing Sections 6.09(a)
or (b), neither the Buyer nor the Surviving Company shall be obligated to
provide such indemnification with respect to any matter for which the Buyer
Indemnified Persons are indemnified under the terms of Article 12.

 



71 (d) At or prior to the Closing, the Company may purchase with effect from the
Closing Date, a non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Company Entities existing directors and officers
insurance policies and the Company Entities existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Tail Policy"), which shall be on such
terms as the Company deems advisable in its discretion.

 

(e) If the Buyer, the Surviving Company or any other Company Entity (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, the Buyer shall ensure that proper provision shall be made
so that such continuing or surviving entity or transferee of such assets, as
the case may be, assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.

 

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.09 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under Applicable Law or under any
agreement with any of the Company Entities. This Section 6.09 is intended to
benefit any individual referenced in this Section 6.09 or indemnified
hereunder (and his or her respective heirs, successors and assigns), each of
whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.09 (whether or not he or she
is a party to this Agreement).

Section 6.10.  _Form ADVs_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause each applicable Company Entity to update
its Form ADV in accordance with the requirements under the Investment Advisers
Act.

 

Section 6.11. ___Debt Financing_. (a) The Buyer and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, as promptly as possible, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as possible, (i) satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, on
a timely basis all conditions to the Buyer and Merger Sub obtaining the Debt
Financing set forth therein (except that such obligation shall not
be breached in respect of any condition where the failure to be so satisfied
is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish the information
described in Section 6.11(f) notwithstanding the Buyers or Merger Subs
reasonable best efforts), (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any related flex provisions) or on other terms
that are (A) acceptable to Lender and (B) in the aggregate not materially
less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Buyer, (iii) timely prepare the
necessary offering circulars, private placement memoranda, or other offering
documents or marketing materials with respect to the Debt Financing, (iv)
commence the syndication activities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
and (v) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing.

 

(b) The Buyer shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any material
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in a breach or
default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt Document of
which the Buyer or Merger Sub 

 



72  becomes aware, (ii) if and when the Buyer or Merger Sub becomes aware that
any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
may not be available for the Financing Purposes, (iii) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to
any (A) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt Document or (B) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or other Debt Document (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing
or Debt Documents) and (iv) of any expiration or termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter or other Debt Document.

 

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer and Merger Sub shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to the
Company copies of executed copies of the definitive documents related to the
Debt Financing ( _provided_ , that any fee letters that, in accordance with
customary practice, are confidential by their terms, and that do not affect
the conditionality or amount of the Debt Financing, may be redacted so as not
to disclose such terms that are so confidential) and copies of any of the
written notices or communications described in the preceding sentence.

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes, or would reasonably be
expected to become, unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter (after taking into account flex terms), the Buyer
and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing, including from alternative sources, in an amount
sufficient to replace any unavailable portion of the Debt Financing
("Alternative Financing") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event and the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall be applicable to
the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes of this Agreement, all
references to the Debt Financing shall be deemed to include such Alternative
Financing and all references to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt
Documents shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative
Financing.

(e) The Buyer and Merger Sub shall (i) comply in all material respects with
the Debt Commitment Letter and each definitive agreement with respect thereto
(collectively, with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Debt Documents"), (ii)
enforce in all material respects their rights under each Debt Document,
including (A) diligently and in good faith analyzing potential litigation
claims, (B) initiating and diligently pursuing all valid claims necessary to
enforce such rights and (C) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions precedent thereto, cause Lender to fund the Debt Financing at or
prior to the time the Closing should occur pursuant to Section 2.04, and (iii)
not permit, without the prior written consent of the Company, any material
amendment or modification to be made to, or any termination, rescissions or
withdrawal of, or any material waiver of any provision or remedy under, any
Debt Document or the fee letter referred to in the Debt Commitment
Letter, including any such amendment, modification or waiver that
(individually or in the aggregate with any other amendments, modifications or
waivers) would reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing under any Debt Document (including by changing the

 



73  amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof, except as
permitted thereunder), or (B) impose any new or additional condition, or
otherwise amend, modify or expand any condition, to the receipt of any
portion of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
(1) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (2) make the funding of any portion of
the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion
of the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the
ability of the Buyer or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against any other
party to any Debt Document, the ability of the Buyer or Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the Buyer or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates have
any obligation to institute any claim, action, suit or proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.11. The Buyer and Merger Sub shall provide notice to the Company
promptly upon receiving the Debt Financing.

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the other Company
Entities to, use commercially reasonable efforts, at the Buyers sole
expense, to cooperate with the Buyer as necessary in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing or any other financing of the Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including any equity
financing) as may be customary and reasonably requested by the Buyer,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to do the following:

 

(i) commenting on or assisting with the preparation (including providing
information and materials to be used in the preparation) of customary
confidential information memoranda or similar offering documents (including
prospectuses and prospectus supplements) for the Debt Financing or any other
financing of the Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any equity financing), customary rating agency presentations
and lender presentations; _provided_ , that any such document and rating
agency presentations shall contain disclosure and financial
statements reflecting the Company as the obligor;

(ii) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and delivering conditional
upon (and effective only as of) the Closing, one or more credit agreements,
guarantees, pledge and security documents, supplemental indentures, currency
or interest hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, or
other certificates, documents, or closing deliverables with respect to the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as may be reasonably
requested by the Buyer (including customary consents of accountants for use of
their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) or otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral;

(iii) furnishing the Buyer (for filing with the SEC and to be included in any
prospectus or prospectus supplement) and the Debt Financing Sources as
promptly as practicable with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company Entities as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer,
including: (A) (1) the audited annual financial statements of the Company
Entities for the

 



74  year ending December 31, 2016 and (2) the unaudited financial statements of
the Company Entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and

100 review, in each case in this clause (A) not later than February 28, 2017,
(B) unaudited quarterly financial statements of the Company Entities for each
fiscal quarter of 2017 upon which the Companys auditors have performed an
SAS 100 review as promptly as practicable and in any event within 45 days
after the end of such quarter (including financial statements for the period
elapsed from the beginning of 2017 to the end of such quarter, and comparable
periods of 2016) and (C) all other financial data regarding the Company
Entities reasonably required to permit the Buyer to prepare customary pro
forma financial statements;

 

(iv) furnishing to the Buyer, for distribution to Lender, information
reasonably required by Lender for compliance with applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001 at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing to
the extent requested at least ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing;

(v) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including
customary one-on-one meetings and conference calls with the parties acting as
lead arrangers, bookrunners or agents for, and prospective lenders and
purchasers of, the Debt Financing, parties acting as underwriters or
placement agents for any other financing of the Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any equity financing) and senior
management and representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of
the Company Entities) at reasonable times as mutually agreed upon reasonable
prior notice, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions
with rating agencies, and reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts
of the Buyer and Lender, in each case in connection with the Debt Financing or
any other financing of the Buyer in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any equity financing);

 

(vi) cooperating reasonably with the due diligence of Lender or any

(vii) cooperating reasonably in satisfying the conditions precedent set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document relating to the Debt
Financing (to the extent the satisfaction of such condition requires the
cooperation, and is within the control, of the Company or its Subsidiaries);

 

(viii) cooperating reasonably with the Buyer in the Buyers efforts to obtain
consents, legal opinions, surveys, title insurance and insurance affidavits
as reasonably requested by the Buyer;

 



75 (ix) providing customary authorization letters to Lender of the Debt
Financing authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders
(subject to reasonable confidentiality provisions) and, with respect to any
public-side version of such information, confirming that such version consists
exclusively of information and documentation that does not contain
information that is (A) of a type that would not be publicly available (or
could be derived from publicly available information) if any Company Entity
was a public reporting company and (B) material with respect to any Company
Entity or any of their respective securities for purposes of foreign, United
States Federal and state securities laws; and

 

(x) executing and delivering (or obtaining from its advisors), and causing all
Company Entities to execute and deliver (or obtain from their advisors),

similar matters reasonably requested by the Buyer, including, in any case, the

Section 6.11(f)(iii) and the audited annual financial statements of the
Company Entities (or any predecessor) for the years ending December 31, 2013,
2014 and 2015 in any registration statement of the Buyer filed with the SEC
relating to any financing and causing such independent accountants to provide
customary comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort,
if appropriate) in connection with any offering to the applicable
underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents;

_provided_ that (u) such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company Entities, (v) none of the
Company Entities shall be required to incur any liability in connection with
the Debt Financing prior to the Closing, (w) none of the pre-Closing
directors, members, managers or general partners, as applicable, of any of the
Company Entities shall be required to adopt resolutions approving the
agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is
obtained, (x) none of the Company Entities shall be required to execute prior
to the Closing any definitive financing documents, including any credit or
other agreements, pledge or security documents, or other certificates, legal
opinions or documents in connection with the Debt Financing (other than such
documents that are conditioned upon, and will not become effective until
after, the Closing), (y) except as expressly provided above, no Company
Entity shall be required to take any corporate actions prior to the Closing to
permit the consummation of the Debt Financing, and (z) the Buyer and Merger
Sub shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Company Entity, and their respective pre-Closing directors, officers and
representatives, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred, directly
or indirectly, in connection with the Debt Financing or any information
provided by a Company Entity in connection therewith, except in the event such
losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses arose out of or result from
the willful misconduct of a Company Entity or any breach of such Person of any
of the representations or warranties as to such financial statements pursuant
to Section 3.07(a) and Section 3.07(b).

 



76 (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability to
the Buyer or Merger Sub in respect of any financial statements, other
financial information or data or other information provided pursuant to this
Section 6.11, except pursuant to Article 12 in respect of any breach of such
Person of any of the representations or warranties as to such financial
statements pursuant to Sections 3.07(a) and 3.07(b). The Buyer shall promptly
reimburse the Company Entities for all out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by any Company Entity in connection with
such cooperation (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the incremental cost
and expense incurred by the Company Entities in using their
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) prepare their financial statements for
the applicable periods by the time specified in Section 6.11(f)(iii) rather
than the time that such financial statements would have been prepared in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) deliver or
cause to be delivered the certificates, accounting consents, comfort letters
or other documents contemplated by Section 6.11(f)(x)) and, to the extent the
Buyer does not reimburse any Company Entity for any such cost or expense at
or prior to the Closing, the Company shall be deemed to have a current asset
in the amount of such unreimbursed costs and expenses for purposes of
calculating Closing Working Capital hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the condition set forth in Section 9.02(b), as
it applies to the Companys obligations under this Section 6.11, shall be
deemed satisfied unless (i) the Company shall have breached its obligations
under this Section 6.11 in a manner that would give rise to a failure of the
condition set forth in Section 9.02(b), (ii) the Buyer shall have provided
written notice to the Company of such breach and (iii) such breach is not
cured by the earlier of the tenth Business Day after the giving of such
written notice (the "Cure Period") and the Outside Date or is not capable of
being cured by the Outside Date; provided, however, that if the Closing Date
would otherwise occur prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, the Closing
Date shall instead occur (subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver (by the party or the parties entitled to the benefit
thereof) of the conditions set forth in Article 9) on the earlier of the date
that is (x) the third Business Day following the earlier of (I) the expiration
of the Cure Period and (II) the date on which such breach is cured and (y)
the Outside Date.

(h) The Company, on behalf of itself and each Company Entity, hereby consents
to the use of its logo in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ ,
that such logos are used in a manner that is not intended to and would not
reasonably be likely to harm or disparage any Company Entity.

 

Section 6.12. _Notification of Employee Resignations_. The Company shall
promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, notify Buyer of any
employee set forth on Section 6.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule who
gives written notice of such employees resignation of such employees
employment.

 

Section 6.13. _Affiliate Agreements_. Effective as of the Closing, the Company
shall cause all contracts, agreements or other transactions between the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the Company Entities), on
the one hand, and the Company Entities, on the other, with respect to which
there would otherwise be liability or ongoing obligations on the part of the
Sellers, the Buyer or any of their respective

 



77  Affiliates (including the Company Entities after the Closing), to be settled
or terminated prior to the Closing without any liability on the part of the
Buyer, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (including the
Company Entities after the Closing) (including liability arising from such
termination), except for this Agreement, the agreements set forth on Section
6.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, any rights to indemnification under
any other such contract or agreement, any Employee Plans and the Rollover
Agreement; _provided_ , that with respect to the right to indemnification
under any other such contract or agreement, neither the Buyer nor
the Surviving Company shall be obligated to provide such indemnification with
respect to any matter for which the Buyer Indemnified Persons are indemnified
under the terms of Article 12. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that (a) the agreements to be terminated pursuant to
the foregoing sentence shall include the Company LLC Agreement and (b) this
Section 6.13 shall constitute the agreement of the Sellers to terminate,
effective as of the Closing, the Company LLC Agreement without any liability
on the part of any of the parties thereto or their respective Affiliates
(except for Sections 7.5, 8.9(c), 11.1, 11.2 and 11.4 thereof).

 

ARTICLE 7

TAX MATTERS

Section 7.01. _Tax Returns_. (a) The Seller Representative shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all income Tax Returns
for the Company Entities that are required to be filed after the Closing Date
in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period, including any required
Schedule K-1s and other information returns in respect of Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (each a "Seller-Filed Pre-Closing Income Tax Return"). Such Seller-
Filed Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with the
past practice of the Company Entities. The Seller Representative shall permit
the Buyer to review and comment on each Seller-Filed Pre-Closing Income Tax
Return prior to filing and shall consider all such comments in good faith. In
accordance with Section 7.02, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Company Entities to, provide any documents, information or
other assistance reasonably requested by the Seller Representative in
connection with the preparation, filing and any amendment of any such Seller-
Filed Pre-Closing Income Tax Return.

(b) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed all other Tax Returns for the Company Entities that are required
to be filed after the Closing Date in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
any Straddle Period (each such Tax Return, a "Buyer-Filed Tax Return"). Such
Buyer-Filed Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with the past practice of
the Company Entities and without a change of any election or any accounting
method. To the extent any such Buyer-Filed Tax Returns relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period under which indemnification may be
sought under Section 12.02, the Buyer shall submit a draft of such Tax Return
and, in the case of a Straddle Period, a statement of the portion of Taxes
for which Sellers are responsible under Section 12.02 to the Seller
Representative (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Seller Representative, supporting documentation)
at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including any applicable
extension) of the relevant Tax Return. Sellers shall have the

 



78  right to review and comment on such Tax Return and statement submitted by
the Buyer to the Seller Representative. If the Seller Representative, within
ten (10) days after review of any such Tax Return or statement by the
Sellers, notifies the Buyer in writing that it objects to any items in such
Tax Return or statement, the disputed item shall be resolved in a manner
mutually agreeable to both parties within ten (10) days, and if not so
resolved, then by a jointly retained Accounting Referee (which may be the same
as or different from the Accounting Referee retained pursuant to Section 2.06,
if any) within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for
filing such Tax Return. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax
Return shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution and shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties without further adjustment. The costs, fees and
expenses of such Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by the Buyer and
the Sellers. The Buyer shall not file any Tax Returns that are subject to the
Sellers review and comment under this Section 7.01(b) without the Seller
Representatives consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with
respect to any Buyer-Filed Tax Return filed under this Section 7.01(b) in
accordance with Applicable Law. Any Pre-Closing Taxes reflected on a Buyer-
Filed Tax Return prepared in compliance with this Section 7.01(b) that are
finally determined to be payable shall be paid by the Sellers to the Buyer, to
the extent not paid at or before Closing or taken into account in the
calculation of Final Purchase Price, no later than five (5) days after Buyer
has paid such Taxes. In the event of a resolution between the parties with
respect to any Buyer-Filed Tax Return under this Section 7.01(b), any
previously filed Buyer Tax Return shall be adjusted to reflect such
resolution, including by the filing of an amended Tax Return.

 

Section 7.02. _Assistance and Cooperation_. From and after the Closing, the
Seller Representative and the Buyer shall:

 

(a) Reasonably assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to reasonably
assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns or reports that such
other party is responsible for preparing and filing with respect to the
Company Entities, and the Buyer shall cause the Company Entities to retain all
records related to Taxes for an eight-year period after the Closing Date, and
shall deliver such records to the Seller Representative at the Seller
Representatives request;

(b) Reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any of the Company Entities;

(c) Make available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of any of
the Company Entities (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include any
such items relating to Taxes of the Sellers or any of the Sellers Affiliates
that do not relate to the Company Entities); and

(d) Furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to Taxes for which the other party may be liable under this Agreement.

 



79 Section 7.03. _Post-Closing Actions_. From and after the Closing, the Buyer
shall not, and shall cause the Company Entities not to, make any Tax
election, amend any Tax Return or waive or extend any statute of limitations
for the assessment or collection of Taxes, in each case with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, and in each case to the extent
such action would result in an adverse effect to the Sellers, without the
Seller Representatives prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 7.04. _Transfer Taxes_. All excise, sales, use, value added,
registration stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property,
transfer, gains and similar Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by the Buyer on the
one hand and the Sellers on the other hand. The Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall cooperate in providing each other with any appropriate
resale exemption certifications and other similar documentation.

 

Section 7.05. _Section_ __ _ 754 Election_. The Company and any Company
Entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall
make and have in effect, for its taxable year ending on the Closing Date, an
election under Section 754 of the Code and any comparable provisions of
applicable state or local law.

 

Section 7.06. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within 90 days following the
Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a
determination of the fair market values of the underlying assets of the
Company Entities (the "FMV Determination") in accordance with the rules of
Section 755 of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder. If within 20
days after the delivery of the FMV Determination, the Buyer notifies the
Seller Representative in writing that the Buyer objects to the determination
set forth in the FMV Determination, the Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disagreements within 20 days. If
the Seller Representative and the Buyer are unable in good faith to reach an
agreement regarding any such disagreements within 20 days, then the Seller
Representative and the Buyer shall jointly retain a nationally recognized
accounting firm (the "FMV Determination Referee") to resolve the disputed
items. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the determination reflected on
the FMV Determination shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The
costs, fees and expenses of the FMV Determination Referee shall be borne in
the same manner as the costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee. The
Seller Representative and the Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the FMV
Determination. The FMV Determination shall be adjusted as appropriate
consistent with the determination set forth in the FMV Determination, in the
event of any adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 7.07. _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any Taxes (other than any
transfer taxes described in Section 7.04) where an applicable Straddle Period
is not or cannot be closed on the Closing Date, the amount of Taxes allocable
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (including
for purposes of determining the amount of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period with respect to such Straddle Period) shall be deemed to be (i) in
the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes 

 



80  and Taxes based upon or related to income, the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the Straddle Period up through and ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use
Tax, the amount of any such Taxes that would have been payable if the relevant
Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth in the foregoing
clause (ii) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Sellers or the Company Entities.

Section 7.08. _Tax Refunds_. Until the Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date,
the Buyer shall pay over to the applicable Seller any Tax refunds (or credits
in lieu of Tax refunds) that are received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, after Closing, the Company Entities) that are attributable to any
Taxes in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such payment shall be made
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of such refund (or the filing
of any Tax Return on which there is allowed a credit in lieu of such refund).
Until the Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date, the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after Closing, the Company Entities) shall, upon request of the
Seller Representative and at the expense of the Sellers, use reasonable
efforts to obtain any such Tax refunds (or credits in lieu of Tax refunds) to
which any of them are entitled; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not be required to take any action that would be impractical
or would otherwise prejudice the legal, tax, or commercial position of the
Buyer and its Affiliates, as determined in Buyers sole discretion exercised
in good faith.

 

Section 7.09. _Buyer Covenants_. (a) Until the Initial Indemnity Escrow
Release Date, the Buyer shall pay and indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers
from and against any and all Taxes imposed on a Seller as a result of any
actions taken by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Company Entities on
the Closing Date after the Closing, other than (i) in the ordinary course of
business or (ii) otherwise as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) From and after the Closing until the Initial Indemnity Escrow Release
Date, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company Entities not to, make
any Tax election, amend any Tax Return, initiate any voluntary disclosure with
respect to Taxes, voluntarily approach any Governmental Authority with
respect to Taxes or waive or extend any statute of limitations for the
assessment or collection of Taxes, in each case if Sellers would have an
indemnification obligation under Article 12 with respect to such Taxes,
without the Seller Representatives prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

ARTICLE 8

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 8.01. _Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits._ During the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Buyer agrees to provide, or to cause its Affiliates to
provide, each employee who

 



81  continues in the employment of the Company Entities after the Closing (each,
a "Continuing Employee") with (a) a base salary that is no less than the base
salary provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
(taking into account payroll Taxes resulting from such Continuing Employee
becoming an "employee", and (b) upon a termination by the Buyer or one of its
Affiliates without cause, and subject to the Continuing Employees execution
of a general release of claims in favor of the Buyer and its Affiliates in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and such Continuing Employee (an
"Employee Release"), severance protections and benefits no less favorable to
such Continuing Employee than those provided by the Company Entities to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, as set forth in Section
8.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Buyer agrees to provide, or to
cause its Affiliates to provide, each Continuing Employee with targeted annual
incentive compensation opportunities for fiscal year 2017 that are comparable
in the aggregate to the targeted annual incentive compensation opportunities
provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing. During
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2017, the
Buyer agrees to provide, or to cause its Affiliates to provide, to each
Continuing Employee, (x) welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided by the Company Entities to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (y) retirement benefits that
are substantially comparable those provided to similarly-situated employees of
the Buyer and its Affiliates. The Buyer shall be solely responsible for, and
shall honor, pay, perform and satisfy, all severance obligations paid or
payable to officers, employees or other service providers of any of the
Company Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 8.02. _Company Employee Plans._ From and after the Closing, the Buyer
agrees to honor, or shall cause each of the Company Entities to honor, the
obligations of the Company Entities under the provisions of each Employee
Plan; _provided,_ that nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to
prevent the Buyer or its Affiliates from amending or terminating any Employee
Plan in accordance with its terms after the Closing.

Section 8.03. _Buyer Employee Plans._ (a) From and after the Closing, the
Buyer or one of its Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each compensation or employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement
maintained or contributed to by the Buyer or such Affiliate and in which any
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate to treat the prior service of
such Continuing Employee with any of the Company Entities as service rendered
to the Buyer or such Affiliate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accruals under the employee benefit plans of the Buyer or its
Affiliates (other than (x) benefit accruals under defined benefit plans of the
Buyer or its Affiliates, (y) where such treatment would result in a
duplication of benefits, or (z) where such service was not recognized under
the corresponding Employee Plan or is not recognized for similarly-situated
employees of the Buyer or its Affiliates).

 

(b) Subject to the terms of the applicable plans of the Buyer and its
Affiliates, from and after the Closing, with respect to any
Continuing Employee, each of Buyer and its Affiliates shall (i) waive any
limitation on health and welfare coverage of such

 



82  Continuing Employee due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods,
active employment requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good
health under the applicable health and welfare plan of the Buyer or such
Affiliate to the extent such Continuing Employee is covered under a health and
welfare benefit plan maintained by any of the Company Entities immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) credit each Continuing Employee with all
deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such Continuing
Employee and covered dependents under the medical employee benefit plan of
any of the Company Entities prior to the Closing Date during the year in which
the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents have satisfied their deductible
and whether they have reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any medical plan
maintained by the Buyer or such Affiliate for such year;  _provided_ that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide to the Buyer as of or
promptly following the Closing Date such information requested by the Buyer as
is reasonably necessary to implement the provisions of clause (ii).

Section 8.04. _401(k) Plan_. If requested by the Buyer at least fifteen days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company Entities shall terminate any and all
Employee Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that
include a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. If the Buyer requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be
terminated, the Company Entities shall provide the Buyer with evidence that
such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated not later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

Section 8.05. _2016 Annual Bonuses_. In the event that the Closing occurs
prior to the date on which the Company Entities pay annual bonuses in respect
of the 2016 calendar year, the Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to,
pay (at the time and in the manner consistent with past practice, but in no
event later than 75 days following the Closing Date) each employee of the
Company Entities who is employed immediately prior to the Closing Date a bonus
for the 2016 calendar year in an amount (less any applicable withholding) that
is no less than the portion of the Closing 2016 Bonus Liability attributable
to such Continuing Employee; _provided_ , that the payment of any annual bonus
hereunder shall not result in a duplication of benefits (including a
duplication of any bonus or portion thereof payable to any former employee in
connection with any severance or similar entitlement). For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties agree that the Tax deduction attributable to the payment of
the Closing 2016 Bonus Liability shall be claimed by the Company Entities on
their Form 1065 for 2016 or the period that ends on the Closing Date, as
determined by the Sellers Representative, and that such deduction shall not
be claimed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

Section 8.06. _2017 Annual Bonuses_. The Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, pay, no later than March 15, 2018, an annual bonus for the
2017 calendar year to each Continuing Employee who remains employed by the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates as of the applicable payment date in an amount
(less any applicable withholding) consistent with the Buyers obligation in
Section 8.01 to provide Continuing

 



83  Employees with targeted annual incentive compensation opportunities for
fiscal year 2017 that are comparable in the aggregate to the targeted annual
incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing; provided that the 2017 bonus paid to each
Continuing Employee shall be no less than the Closing 2017 Bonus Liability
attributable to such Continuing Employee. Further, in addition to
any severance protections and benefits required to be provided pursuant to
clause (b) of Section 8.01 above (but without duplication of any entitlement
to a pro rata bonus entitlement pursuant to any Employee Plan), the Buyer
agrees to provide, or to cause its Affiliates to provide, each Continuing
Employee whose employment is terminated by the Buyer or one of its Affiliates
without cause on or prior to the payment of his or her 2017 annual bonus, and
subject to such Continuing Employees execution of an Employee Release, a pro
rata portion of his or her 2017 annual bonus in an amount equal to the greater
of (x) the annual bonus that would have been payable based on actual
performance had such Continuing Employees employment continued through the
applicable payment date _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days during the 2017 calendar year prior to the date of
termination and the denominator of which is equal to 365, and (y) an amount
equal to the portion of the Closing 2017 Bonus Liability attributable to such
Continuing Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the
Tax deduction attributable to the payment of any amounts covered by this
Section 8.06 shall be claimed by the Buyer and its Affiliates in a Post-
Closing Tax Period and shall not be claimed by the Company Entities for the
taxable year that ends on the Closing Date or any prior taxable year. 

Section 8.07. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Article 8,
whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan, (ii) prohibit the Company
Entities, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan or, after the Closing, any Employee
Plan in accordance with its terms, (iii) obligate the Company Entities, the
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to retain the employment of any
particular employee or (iv) confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any person other than the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assignees.

date, all of the conditions set forth in Article 9 have been satisfied or, to
the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit thereof, other than (i) the condition set forth in Section 9.01(c) and
(ii) conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which
shall be capable of being satisfied or shall have been waived on such date,
then the Company or the Buyer may, by written notice to the other parties,
extend the Outside Date to September 16, 2017; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(b) shall
not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
has caused or resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by the
Outside Date;

 

(c) by the Company or the Buyer if there shall be any final, non-appealable
injunction or other order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States prohibiting the consummation of the Closing; _provided_ , that

under Section 6.02 in respect of such injunction or order in all material
respects;

(d) by the Company, if the Buyer has breached any representation or warranty,
or breached or failed to perform any covenant or agreement, contained in this

the conditions set forth in Section 9.03(a) or 9.03(b) and is not cured
within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the Buyer of such breach
or is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date; _provided,_ that the

conditions set forth in Section 9.02(a) or 9.02(b) not to be satisfied; or

(e) by the Buyer, if the Company or the Sellers has breached any
representation or warranty, or breached or failed to perform any covenant or

or (b) Willful Breach by any party of any covenant or agreement contained
herein, such party shall be fully liable to the other parties for any and all
costs, expenses, damages, losses or other liability incurred or suffered by

is the consequence of an action or omission by any party that knew or
reasonably should have known that the taking of such action or the failure to
take such action would be a breach of this Agreement and (ii) with respect to

ARTICLE 11

 

SELLER REPRESENTATIVE

 

Section 11.01. _Authorization of Seller Representative_. (a) From and after
the Closing, by virtue of the Companys entry into this Agreement and without
further action of any Seller, the Seller Representative is hereby irrevocably
appointed, authorized and empowered to act as a representative of the Sellers,
and the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of the Sellers,
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, which shall include
the power and authority:

 

(i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement;

 

(ii) to execute and deliver such amendments, modifications, waivers and
consents in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the Seller
Representative, in its sole discretion, determines to be necessary or
desirable;

 

(iii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Sellers and the
Seller Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or any
other agreement, document, instrument or certificate referred to herein or
therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including (A)
asserting or pursuing any claim or instituting any action, proceeding or
investigation against the Buyer, (B) investigating, defending, contesting or
litigating any claim, action, proceeding or investigation initiated by the
Buyer and (C) negotiating, settling or compromising any claim, action,
proceeding or investigation by or against the Buyer, including, in each case,
any claim, action, proceeding or investigation relating to the Purchase Price
adjustment under Section 2.06 or the Revenue Run Rate true-up under Section
2.07; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Representative
shall not have any obligation to take any such action, and shall not have any
liability for any failure to take any such action; and

 



88 (iv) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other
agreements, documents, instruments or certificates, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all other actions that the Seller
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines to be
necessary or desirable in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and any other agreement,
document, instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

(b) In connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other
agreement, document, instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and in exercising or not
exercising any or all of the powers conferred upon the Seller Representative
hereunder, (i) the Seller Representative shall incur no responsibility
whatsoever to any Seller by reason of any error in judgment or other action
or omission, other than liability directly resulting from the willful
misconduct by the Seller Representative and (ii) the Seller Representative
shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or
other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in
judgment or other action or omission of the Seller Representative pursuant to
such advice shall not subject the Seller Representative to liability to any
Seller, other than where such reliance constitutes the willful misconduct of
the Seller Representative.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, the Seller Representative shall have the right
to recover from, at its sole discretion, the amounts in the Seller
Representative Expense Fund and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund and
Indemnity Escrow Fund (in the case of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund, solely out of any release of the amounts
therein to the Sellers pursuant to terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement), in each case prior to the distribution of any such amounts to the
Sellers, (i) the Seller Representatives reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and (ii) any other costs, expenses, damages or other losses
actually suffered by the Seller Representative, in each case arising out of or
in connection with the actions or omissions of the Seller Representative in
its capacity as the Seller Representative (collectively, "Seller
Representative Losses"). If the amount in the Seller Representative Expense
Fund and amounts in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund and the
Indemnity Escrow Fund available to the Seller Representative are insufficient
to satisfy the Seller Representative Losses, as suffered or incurred, then
each Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, severally and not
jointly, in accordance with the portion of the Purchase Price received by
such Seller as compared with the other Sellers as of such time, the Seller
Representative against all Seller Representative Losses; _provided_ , that if
any such Seller Representative Losses are finally adjudicated to have
directly resulted from the willful misconduct of the Seller Representative,
the Seller Representative shall reimburse the Sellers the amount of such
indemnified Seller Representative Losses to the extent attributable to such
willful misconduct. In no event shall the Seller Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Sellers or otherwise, except to the
extent that the Seller Representative is required to do 

 



89  so hereunder in its capacity as a Seller. In the event of any
indemnification obligation under this Section 11.01(c), upon written notice
from the Seller Representative to the Sellers as to the existence of a
deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification amount, each Seller
shall promptly deliver to the Seller Representative full payment of its
ratable share of the amount of such deficiency, in accordance with the portion
of the Purchase Price received by such Seller as compared with the other
Sellers as of such time.

(d) The Seller Representative may resign at any time, so long as the Sellers
appoint a replacement or successor that is reasonably acceptable to the Buyer
effective as of the time of such resignation. All of the indemnities,
immunities and powers granted to the Seller Representative under this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and the resignation of the Seller
Representative.

against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time, which notice
shall specify the Section or Sections hereof that the party giving such notice
claims to have been breached.

 

Section 12.02. _Indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Persons_. (a) Subject
to the limitations set forth in this Article 12, from and after the Closing,
the Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries (including the Company Entities),

successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Persons") shall
be indemnified against, and each of them shall be held harmless from, in each
case solely out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund:

 



90 (i) any and all damages, losses, liabilities, claims, penalties,
charges, interest and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of
investigation and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and
expenses) (collectively, "Damages") to the extent arising out of:

(A) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by the Company or the
Seller Representative in this Agreement ("Company Warranty Breaches");

(B) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by the
Company or the Seller Representative in this Agreement;

(C) any payment with respect to any claim by a Seller, in his, her or its

Indemnified Persons arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any claim of breach of fiduciary obligations or similar
claim and any claim that this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated
hereunder were not duly approved pursuant to the Company LLC Agreement or
Applicable Law (other than in connection with the enforcement of the terms
hereof);

(D) the enforcement of any of the Buyer Indemnified Persons indemnification
rights under this Section 12.02(a) if the parties agree in writing or it is
determined in a final, non-appealable order by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Buyer Indemnified Person was entitled
to indemnification with respect to the matter for which the Buyer Indemnified
Person was seeking to enforce its rights hereunder;

 

(E) any Closing Indebtedness or Closing Transaction Expenses, in each case
solely to the extent not reflected in the Final Purchase Price; or

in the determination of Closing Working Capital); or

(ii) the matters set forth on Section 12.02(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

(b) With respect to indemnification for Company Warranty Breaches pursuant to
Section 12.02(a)(i)(A) (other than with respect to breaches of the Company
Fundamental Representations), (i) the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be
indemnified unless the Damages with respect to any such Company Warranty
Breach exceeds $25,000 (the "De Minimis Amount") and (ii) the Buyer
Indemnified Persons

 



91  shall not be indemnified unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Damages with respect to such Company Warranty Breaches (disregarding any
Damages that are not indemnifiable pursuant to the forgoing clause (i))
exceeds $3,750,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent of such
excess. With respect to indemnification for all matters pursuant to Section
12.02(a), the maximum aggregate amount with respect to which the Buyer
Indemnified Persons may be indemnified shall be limited to the Indemnity
Escrow Amount (the "Cap").

(c) With respect to indemnification for all matters pursuant to Section
12.02(a) (but subject to Section 12.09), each of the Buyer and Merger Sub
hereby agrees (on behalf of itself and each of the other Buyer Indemnified
Persons) that (i) the sole and exclusive recourse of the Buyer Indemnified
Persons shall be the right to seek payment from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and (ii)
the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no right to seek payment directly
from any of the Seller Indemnified Persons under any circumstances.

(d) Any claim for indemnification in respect of Damages suffered by any Buyer
Indemnified Person under Section 12.02(a) may be made and enforced by the
Buyer only, on behalf of such Buyer Indemnified Person, and may not be made or
enforced directly by any Buyer Indemnified Person other than the Buyer.

Section 12.03. _Indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Persons_. (a)
Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 12, from and after the
Closing, each of the Sellers and each of their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, managers, employees, partners, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") shall be indemnified
by the Buyer against, and each of them shall be held harmless by the Buyer
from, any and all Damages to the extent arising out of:

or Merger Sub in this Agreement.

(b) With respect to indemnification for Buyer Warranty Breaches pursuant to
Section 12.03(a)(i) (other than with respect to breaches of the Buyer
Fundamental Representations), (i) the Seller Indemnified Persons shall not be
indemnified unless the Damages with respect to any such Buyer Warranty Breach
exceeds the De Minimis Amount and (ii) the Seller Indemnified Persons shall
not be indemnified unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages with
respect to such Company Warranty Breaches (disregarding any Damages that are
not indemnifiable pursuant to the foregoing clause (i)) exceeds the
Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess. With respect to
indemnification for all matters pursuant to Section 12.03(a), the maximum
aggregate amount with respect to which the Seller Indemnified Persons may be
indemnified shall be limited to the Cap.

 



92 (c) Any claim for indemnification in respect of Damages suffered by any Seller
Indemnified Person under Section 12.03(a) may be made and enforced by the
Seller Representative only, on behalf of such Seller Indemnified Person, and
may not be made or enforced directly by any Seller Indemnified Person other
than the Seller Representative.

 

Section 12.04. _Third-Party Claim Procedures._ (a)The party seeking
indemnification under Section 12.02(a) or Section 12.03(a) (the "Indemnified
Party") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom
indemnity is to be sought (which in the case of a claim by the Buyer shall be
the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) (the "Indemnifying
Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action
or proceeding by any third party (a "Third-Party Claim") in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances of such Third-Party Claim
(including any relevant material documentation to or from third-parties
relating thereto and the Indemnified Partys reasonable computation (taking
into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party) of the
total amount of Damages to which such Indemnified Party would be entitled in
respect of such Third-Party Claim) and the basis for indemnification in
respect thereof, including the Section or Sections hereof that the
Indemnified Party claims to have been breached (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure of the
Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel of its choice
for such defense, in each case at its own expense.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.04,
(i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim, if the
settlement (A) does not release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim; (B)
imposes injunctive or other equitable relief on the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates; or (C) involves a finding or admission of any violation of
Applicable Law and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of any Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its
choice and at its own expense for such purpose. The Indemnified Party shall
not settle any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to
reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim,
and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



93 Section 12.05. _Direct Claim Procedures._ In the event an Indemnified Party
has a claim for indemnity under Section 12.02(a) or Section 12.03(a) against
the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim"), the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice thereof in writing
to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances of such Direct Claim and the basis for
indemnification in respect thereof, including the Section or Sections hereof
that the Indemnified Party claims to have been breached and the Indemnified
Partys reasonable computation of the total amount of Damages to which such
Indemnified Party would be entitled in respect of such Direct Claim (taking
into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The
failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

Section 12.06. _Escrow Procedures_. The parties hereto agree that (a) their
respective rights and obligations with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
including the funding of the requisite amounts into the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
the procedure for the making of claims against the amounts in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund and the release of such amounts from the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
shall be governed by, and subject to the terms and provisions of, this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and (b) promptly after the determination
hereunder of any amounts due from or with respect to the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, they shall deliver to the Escrow Agent irrevocable joint
instructions giving effect to the release of such amounts in accordance with
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. On the
Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Date, the parties shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers, in
accordance with the Proceeds Allocation Methodology, the Initial Indemnity
Escrow Release Amount. On the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date, the
parties shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release to the Sellers, in accordance with the Proceeds Allocation
Methodology, the remaining balance of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, less
any amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund subject to holdback for unresolved
claims for indemnification pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ that the parties shall cause the aggregate amount of any
funds that are not distributed on the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Date due
to an unresolved claim for indemnification to be released as promptly as
practicable following the resolution thereof. The Seller Representative shall
direct the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers amounts from the Seller
Representative Expense Fund in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 12.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

Section 12.07. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 12.02(a) or Section 12.03(a), as applicable, by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible therefor. If the Indemnified Party receives
any amounts under applicable insurance policies or from any

 



94  other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, after the
Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment in respect of such
Damages, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any payment made by such Indemnifying Party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party
in collecting such amount.

(b) No right of indemnification hereunder shall be limited by reason of (i)
investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing or the knowledge
of an Indemnified Party of any information that would cause one or more of the
representations and warranties made by the Indemnifying Party to be inaccurate
as of the date made or (ii) the decision of either party to complete the
Closing.

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under applicable insurance policies, or from
any other Person reasonably believed to be responsible (other than any
Clients), for any Damages payable under Section 12.02(a) or Section 12.03(a),
as applicable.

 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 12.02(a) or
Section 12.03(a), as applicable, for any Damages relating to any matter to
the extent that (i) the Indemnified Party has otherwise been compensated for
such Damages pursuant to the purchase price adjustment under Section 2.06,
(ii) the Indemnified Party has recovered for such Damages under
another provision of this Agreement or (iii) such Damages have been
specifically accrued or reserved for (with a specific reference to the matter
described) in the Balance Sheet (or disclosed in the notes thereto).

 

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Damages for which such Indemnified Party may
seek indemnification under this Agreement, as required by Applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any
Person be liable to another Person hereunder for (and the term Damages shall
exclude) (i) any indirect, special or consequential damages, or lost profits
or diminution in value, except in each case to the extent such damages were
the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the relevant breach or (ii)
exemplary or punitive damages (except, in the case of both clauses (i) and
(ii), to the extent such damages are awarded against the applicable Person in
a Third-Party Claim).

Section 12.08. _Materiality_. In all cases in determining whether there has
been a breach of a representation or warranty or calculating the amount of
any Damage with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth herein, such representations and warranties shall be read without regard
to any materiality qualifier (including any reference to Material Adverse
Effect) contained therein, except with respect to (i) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.07, Section 3.08(a)(ii) and Section 3.09 and
(ii) any limitation or qualification that applies to an affirmative
requirement to list specified items in the Company Disclosure Schedule or to
deliver, furnish, provide or otherwise make available copies of specified
items to the Buyer.

 



95 Section 12.09. _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except with
respect to (a) claims for actual and intentional fraud with respect to the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, (b)
pursuant to Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 7.08 and (c) equitable remedies to enforce
any covenant that expressly contemplates performance after the Closing to the
extent expressly permitted pursuant to Section 13.14, each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees (in the case of each of the Buyer and Merger Sub, on
behalf of itself and each of the other Buyer Indemnified Persons, and in the
case of the Company, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller
Indemnified Persons (in each case, such partys "Respective Indemnified
Persons")) that the sole and exclusive remedy of such party and its
Respective Indemnified Person against any of the other parties or their
Respective Indemnified Persons for any matter or claim relating to the Company
Entities, the operation of the Company Entities respective businesses, the
relationship of any of the Sellers or their respective Related Parties with
the Company Entities, the Company Equity Interests, this Agreement, the
subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
other agreements entered into in connection herewith (including claims for
damages, indemnification, contribution and other rights of recovery arising
out of or relating to any breach of contract, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty, all other claims for breach of duty and all other claims arising
under Applicable Law) shall be as provided by this Article 12.

Section 12.10.  _Purchase Price Adjustment_. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any amount paid under this Article 12 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the consideration paid hereunder.

Section 13.02. _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and is signed, (i) in the case of an amendment, (A) prior to the
Closing, by the Buyer and the Company, and (B) after the Closing, by the Buyer
and the Seller Representative, or (ii) in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , that, prior to the
Closing, the Company, and after the Closing, the Seller Representative, are
hereby authorized to sign amendments hereto and grant waivers hereof on
behalf of the Sellers). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Sections 10.02, 13.02, 13.04, 13.05, 13.07, 13.08, 13.09 and 13.17 may not be
amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that adversely affects any
Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of the parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter (and, if applicable, any Alternative Financing).

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 13.03. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such costs or expenses.

Section 13.04. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , that no party may
assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of (a) prior to the Closing,
the Buyer and the Company, and (b) after the Closing, the Buyer and the Seller
Representative, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer of
rights or obligations under this Agreement without such consent shall be null
and void ab initio, except that the Buyer or Merger Sub may assign or delegate
its rights or obligations under this Agreement to (i) any one of its
Affiliates or (ii) any Debt Financing Source for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning this Agreement as collateral

transactions contemplated hereby or (B) relieve the Buyer or Merger Sub of any
of its obligations hereunder).

Section 13.05. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and

98 Section 13.06. _Arbitration_. (a) In the event of any dispute, claim
or controversy with respect to the enforcement of any provision of, or based
on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and whether brought by or against any party or any of its
Related Parties), each of the parties agrees that they shall attempt to settle
such dispute, claim or controversy through good faith negotiations between
senior business executives with authority to resolve such matter.

(b) Except for disputes, claims or controversies with respect to which
provisions of this Agreement expressly provide for certain alternative
dispute resolution procedures to apply (including Sections 2.06, 2.07 and
13.07), any dispute, claim or controversy described in Section 13.06(a) that
cannot be resolved by the parties through good faith negotiations within 15
days after the notification to the other parties of the commencement of the
dispute resolution procedures of this Section 13.06 shall then, upon the
written request of either the Company or the Buyer, prior to the Closing, or
the Seller Representative or the Buyer, after the Closing, be resolved by
binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the then effective Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association by a panel of
three arbitrators. Each of the Company and the Buyer, prior to the Closing,
or the Seller Representative and the Buyer, after the Closing, shall, within
15 days after the written request for arbitration is made, select one
arbitrator who shall be a subject-matter expert with respect to the dispute
in question. Such parties shall attempt to agree upon the third arbitrator,
who shall be a subject-matter expert with respect to the dispute in question,
but if they are unable to agree on such arbitrator within 15 days after the
written request for arbitration is made, the two arbitrators selected by such
parties shall select the third arbitrator within 15 days after such initial
15-day period. The parties hereby agree that such arbitrators shall be
directed to set a schedule for the resolution of any such dispute, claim or
controversy that is reasonable under the circumstances, which shall in no
event be a period longer than 60 days from the date on which the last of the
three arbitrators is selected.

(c) The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States. The
arbitrators decision shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment
upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered by any court having
jurisdiction pursuant to Section 13.07. The expenses of the arbitration shall
be divided equally between the Company and the Buyer, prior to the Closing, or
the Sellers and the Buyer, after the Closing, and any amount payable by the
Sellers pursuant to this sentence may be payable out of the Seller
Representative Expense Fund. Except as may be required by Applicable Law or
any listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange, none
of the parties or the arbitrators may, and each of the parties shall cause
their Representatives not to, disclose the existence, content or results of
any arbitration hereunder, or any discussions, negotiations or resolutions
relating to any disputes, claims or controversies prior to, or in lieu of,
the commencement of any arbitration hereunder, without the prior written
consent of the Company and the Buyer, prior to the Closing, or the Seller
Representative and the Buyer, after the Closing.

 



99 Section 13.07. _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties agrees (on behalf of itself
and its Related Parties) that any suit, action or proceeding (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and whether brought by or
against any party or any of its Related Parties) seeking to (a) enforce the
provisions of this Agreement expressly providing for certain alternative
dispute resolution procedures to apply to particular disputes, claims or
controversies hereunder (including Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 13.06), (b) seek
emergency relief in aid of arbitration or enter judgment on an arbitral or
other award pursuant to any provisions hereof or (c) obtain specific
performance or other equitable relief under Section 13.14 shall, in each case,
be brought exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall
not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or
other Delaware state court, so long as one of such courts shall have subject
matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 13.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

Section 13.08. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES (ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ITS RELATED PARTIES) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING
ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING
SOURCE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE DEBT FINANCING).

Section 13.09.  _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each party shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
parties. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other parties, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication). Except as provided in Sections
13.04, 13.05, 13.07, 13.08 and this 13.09, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
upon any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, except (i) for (a) the rights of the Company on behalf of
the Sellers to seek equitable relief or damages (which the parties acknowledge
and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and shall include damages, to the extent proven, based on the loss of
the economic benefit of the transactions contemplated hereby to the Sellers)
in the event of

 



100  the breach or wrongful termination of this Agreement by the Buyer or Merger
Sub, (b) the rights of the Sellers pursuant to Section 6.05(b) and the
Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 6.09, (c) the rights of the Sellers

Indemnified Persons of the parties hereto pursuant to Article 12 and (e) the

10.02, 13.02, 13.04, 13.05, 13.07, 13.08, 13.09 and 13.17.

Section 13.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Rollover Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties and their respective Related Parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both oral and written, among the parties and their
respective Related Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

 

Section 13.11. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

Section 13.12. _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The parties agree that any
reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the Company or Seller Representative, as applicable, that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company or
Seller Representative, as applicable, that are contained in this Agreement,
but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties (or covenants)
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. The parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) the Company Disclosure Schedule may include certain items
and information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of the
Buyer and Merger Sub and (ii) the disclosure by the Company of any matter in
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment by the Company that the matter is required to be disclosed by
the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material or has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



101 Section 13.13. _Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney-Client Privilege_. (a) It
is acknowledged by each of the parties that certain of the Sellers and the
Company have retained Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP (the "Sellers Law Firm") to
act as their counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Current Representation"), and that no other party
has the status of a client of the Sellers Law Firm for conflict of interest
or any other purposes as a result thereof. The Buyer hereby agrees that after
the Closing, the Sellers Law Firm may represent any of the Seller, the Seller
Representative or any Representative, equityholder or partner thereof (any
such Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving or arising from
the Current Representation, including any interpretation or application of
this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other dispute between or among the
Buyer, any Company Entity, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives, and any Designated Person, even though the
interests of such Designated Person may be directly adverse to the Buyer, any
Company Entity, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, and even though the Sellers Law Firm may have represented
any Company Entity in a substantially related matter, or may be representing
the Buyer or any Company Entity in ongoing matters. The Buyer hereby waives
and agrees not to, and after the Closing agrees to cause each of the Company
Entities not to, assert (i) any claim that the Sellers Law Firm has a
conflict of interest in any representation described in this Section 13.13,
and (ii) any confidentiality obligation with respect to any communication
between the Sellers Law Firm and any Designated Person or any Company Entity
or any of their respective Representatives occurring during the Current
Representation.

(b) The Buyer hereby agrees that as to all communications (whether before, at
or after the Closing) between the Sellers Law Firm and any Designated Person
or any Company Entity or any of their respective Representatives that relate
in any way to the Current Representation, the attorney-client privilege and
all rights to any other evidentiary privilege, and the protections afforded to
information relating to representation of a client under applicable rules of
professional conduct, belong to the Sellers and may be controlled by the
Sellers (or the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) and shall not
pass to or be claimed by the Buyer, any Company Entity, any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives. Without
limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding any policy of the Buyer, any Company
Entity or any agreement between any Company Entity or any of their respective
Representatives and any Designated Person, whether established or entered into
before, at or after the Closing, the Buyer shall not, and after the Closing
shall cause each of the Company Entities not to, review or use for any purpose
without the Seller Representatives prior written consent, or seek to compel
disclosure to the Buyer, any Company Entity, any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives any communication or
information (whether written, oral, electronic or in any other medium)
described in the previous sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Buyer or any of the Company Entities and a
third party other than a Designated Person after the Closing, any Company
Entity may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by the Sellers Law Firm to such third party.

 



102 (c) THE BUYER AND MERGER SUB HAVE BEEN ADVISED WITH RESPECT TO THIS SECTION
13.13 BY THEIR OWN COUNSEL, AND THE BUYER AND MERGER SUB BELIEVE, HAVING
CONSULTED WITH THEIR COUNSEL, THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ENTER
INTO AND BE BOUND BY THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 13.13.

 

Section 13.14. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties agrees that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its terms, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, each of the
parties agrees that prior to a valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with this Agreement, each party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief,
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
provided in Section 13.07, in addition to any other remedy to which such party
is entitled at law or in equity. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, (a) any defense to the remedy of specific
performance, including that a remedy at law would be inadequate or that a
remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, and (b) any requirement to post a bond,
undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

Section 13.15. _Release of Claims._ __

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to Section 13.15(c)) or in any certificate or other writing delivered
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith, in further consideration of the
transactions contemplated hereby, effective as of (and following) the Closing,
(i) each of the Sellers on behalf of itself and its Related Parties (other
than any portfolio company of such Seller (other than the Company)) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases and waives as against each of the
Buyer, the Company Entities and each of their respective Related Parties and
(ii) each of the Buyer and the Company Entities and their respective Related
Parties, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and waives as against
each of the Sellers and each of their respective Related Parties (other than
any portfolio company of a Seller (other than the Company)), any and all
claims of any nature that any such Person may now or hereafter have, whether
at law or in equity, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law (the
"Released Claims"), arising prior to and through the Closing (the "Release").
It is further agreed and understood that this Release is a full and final
release of all the Released Claims whether known or unknown, fixed or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, manifested or unmanifested,
determined, determinable or otherwise and the Released Claims includes all
rights and claims relating to the Company Entities, the operation of the
Company Entities respective businesses, the relationship of any of the
Sellers or their respective Related Parties with the Company Entities, the
Company Equity Interests, this Agreement, the subject matter hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the other agreements entered into in
connection herewith, including claims for damages, contribution and other
rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any breach of contract,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty, all other claims for breach of duty
and all other claims arising under Applicable Law.

 



103 (b) From and after the Closing, each of the Sellers, on the one hand, and the
Buyer and each of the Company Entities, on the other hand, hereby (i) waives
the protection of any provision of any Applicable Law that would operate to
preserve Released Claims that are unknown as of the Closing Date and (ii)
agrees not to, and to cause its Related Parties not to, bring any action,
suit or proceeding, whether at law or in equity, with respect to any of the
Released Claims.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.15, the
following shall not be deemed "Released Claims," and the Release does not
release and is not a waiver of: (i) any claim by any party hereto or third
party beneficiary hereof (or any of such Persons predecessors, assigns or
Representatives) against another party hereto arising under or relating to
this Agreement (including any claim for indemnification as and to the extent
provided pursuant to Article 12), the Escrow Agreement, any Rollover Agreement
or the Confidentiality Agreement; (ii) any claim that any Person may have, in
his or her capacity as an employee, director or officer of Company Entity for
indemnification, whether pursuant to an indemnification agreement, under such
Company Entitys organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing, pursuant to Applicable Law or pursuant to Section 6.09; (iii)
any rights that arise after the Closing with respect to actions or omissions
that occur after the Closing; (iv) if applicable to a Person, any claim for
vested benefits and unpaid wages accrued prior to the Closing owed to such
Person in his or her capacity as an employee of a Company Entity; (v) any
rights arising under any Employee Plan; (vi) any claim for actual and
intentional fraud with respect to the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement; or (vii) any rights to indemnification
permitted to survive pursuant to Section 6.13.

 

Section 13.16. _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith, each of the parties (on behalf of
itself and its Related Parties) acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any claims that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be made against, the parties to this
Agreement, and no Related Party of the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, any of
the Sellers or the Seller Representative, in each case that is not a party to
this Agreement, shall have any obligation hereunder or in connection herewith
or any liability for any obligation of any of the parties to this Agreement or
for any claim based upon, arising out of or relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether by enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty,
by any legal or equitable action, suit or proceeding, by virtue of any
Applicable Law or otherwise; provided that nothing in this Section 13.16
shall limit in any way any claim for actual and intentional fraud with respect
to the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



104 Section 13.17. _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each of the Sellers, on behalf of itself and its
Related Parties, hereby (i) acknowledges that none of the Debt Financing
Sources shall have any liability to such Seller or Related Parties under this
Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute related to, or arising
from, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof, (ii) waives any rights or claims such Seller or Related Parties may
have against any of the Debt Financing Sources in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and (iii) agrees not to
commence (and if commenced agree to dismiss or otherwise terminate (to the
extent within such Sellers control), and not to assist) any action,
arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, petition, grievance,
complaint, suit or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby. With respect to any dispute or proceeding
relating to this Section 13.17, the Sellers, on behalf of themselves and
their respective Related Parties, (w) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of New York or federal courts of the United States of
America, in each case, sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate
court from any thereof (the courts described in this clause (w), the
"Applicable Courts"), and agree that all claims in respect of any such
litigation may be heard and determined only in the Applicable Courts, (x)
waive, to the fullest extent it may legally do so, any objection which they
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any proceeding in any
Applicable Court, (y) waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such proceeding in any
Applicable Court, and (z) agree that a final judgment in any such proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit in on
the judgment or any other manner provided by law.
