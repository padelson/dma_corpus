that the Sellers&#146; Law Firm has a conflict of interest in any representation described in this Section&nbsp;13.13, and (ii)&nbsp;any confidentiality obligation with respect to any communication between the Sellers&#146; Law Firm and any

Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers (or the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers) and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer, any Company Entity, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives.
Without limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding any policy of the Buyer, any Company Entity or any agreement between any Company Entity or any of their respective Representatives and any Designated Person, whether established or entered into before,

Buyer, any Company Entity, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives any communication or information (whether written, oral, electronic or in any other medium) described in the previous sentence. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or any of the Company Entities and a third party other than a Designated Person after the Closing, any Company Entity may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by the Sellers&#146; Law Firm to such third party. </P>
