Adjustment Amount, and the amounts described in clause _2.07(a)(ii)(C)_ ,
_(D)_ ,  _(E)_ , and _(F)_ (the " _Closing Date Schedule_ ").

(b) The Equityholders Representative will have a period of thirty (30)
calendar days after delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement, and the Closing Date Schedule to review such documents and notify
Parent in writing of any objections it may have. Parent will make its work
papers and back-up materials used in preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
Closing Statement, and Closing Date Schedule available to the Equityholders
Representative and any advisers to the Equityholders Representative at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice. If no written objections are made
by the Equityholders Representative within such thirty (30) day period, then
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Statement, and Closing Date Schedule
as prepared by Parent will be final and binding on the Parties. If written
objections are delivered to Parent by the Equityholders Representative within
such thirty (30) day period, then Parent and the
Equityholders Representative will attempt in good faith to resolve the
matter or matters in dispute during such thirty (30) day period. If disputes
with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Statement, or Closing
Date Schedule cannot be resolved by Parent and the Equityholders
Representative within such thirty (30) day period, then the Equityholders
Representative shall send to the Escrow Agent a written notice of such dispute
(a " _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount Dispute Notice_ "), and, the Parent and
the Equityholders Representative shall submit the specific matters remaining
in dispute to a nationally recognized accounting firm that is independent of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and that is reasonably acceptable to both
the Equityholders Representative and Parent (the " _Arbitrator_ "), which
firm will be directed by Parent and the Equityholders Representative to
render its opinion only as to such specific matters, strictly in

 



25  accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.07_. The Arbitrator will
be directed to send to the Equityholders Representative and Parent its
determination of the specified matters in dispute, which determination will,
in the absence of manifest error, be final and binding on the Parties. Parent,
on the one hand, and the Equityholders Representative, on the other hand,
will each bear its or his own expenses and fees and the fees and expenses of
its or his own representatives and experts, including its or his own
independent accountants, in connection with the preparation, review, dispute
(if any) and final determination of the Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness and Post-Closing Adjustment Amount. The costs, expenses
and fees of the Arbitrator will be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and by
the Equityholders Representative, on the other hand, based on the percentage
that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to such Party bears to
the amount actually contested.

(c) Following the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount
pursuant to _Section 2.07(b)_:

(i) if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is negative, Parent and the
Equityholders Representative shall, within three (3) Business Days following
the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount pursuant to
_Section 2.07(b)_, execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written
instructions directing the Escrow Agent to disburse cash equal to the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount to Parent; or

(ii) if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is positive, Parent shall, within
ten (10) Business Days following the final determination of the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount under  _Section 2.07(b)_ and the delivery of the Payment
Schedule for the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, deliver to the Paying Agent
for distribution to the Equityholders (other than Employee Optionholders) in
the amounts described in  _Sections 2.04(c)(ii)_ , _2.05(a)(ii)_ , and
_2.06(b)_ , the portion of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount payable to such
Equityholders (as set forth in the Payment Schedule for the Post-Closing
Adjustment Amount), and (2) pay or cause one of its Subsidiaries to pay,
through Parents or one of its Subsidiaries payroll system, to each Employee
Optionholder, the amount payable to such Employee Optionholder pursuant to
_Section 2.05(a)(ii)_ and as set forth in the Payment Schedule for the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount.

SECTION 2.08 _Sales Earnout_.

 

(a) Upon the first time Net Sales with respect to any four (4) consecutive
Calendar Quarters ending on or before the five (5) year anniversary of the
Closing Date exceed one hundred seventy five million dollars ($175,000,000) in
the aggregate, then a one-time payment of twenty five million dollars
($25,000,000) shall be paid by Parent to the Equityholders in accordance with
_Section 2.08(a)(i)_.

(i) Any payments payable pursuant to _Section 2.08(a)_ (the " _Sales
Earnout_ ") shall, subject to the right of set off set forth in _Section
2.09_, be paid within thirty (30) calendar days after the date on which (A)
the Parent determines, in good faith, and delivers a notice to the
Equityholders Representative that the Net Sales threshold set forth in
_Section 2.08(a)_ was achieved (the " _Earnout Notice_ "), which notice shall
be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable following such determination,
or (B) the Arbitrator determines, pursuant

 



26  to the procedure described in _Section 2.08(d)_, that the Net Sales
threshold set forth in _Section 2.08(a)_ was achieved, in each case, subject
to the delivery by the Equityholders Representative of the Payment Schedule
for the Earnout. Parent, shall, subject to the right of set off set forth in
_Section 2.09_, (1) pay to the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Equityholders (other than the Employee Optionholders) in the amounts
described in _Sections 2.04(c)(iii)_ , _2.05(a)(iii)_ , and _2.06(c)_ , the
portion of the Sales Earnout payable to such Equityholders (as set forth in
the Payment Schedule for the Earnout), and (2) pay or cause one of its
Subsidiaries to pay, through Parents or one of its Subsidiaries payroll
system, to each Employee Optionholder, the amount payable to such Employee
Optionholder pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)(iii)_ and as set forth in the
Payment Schedule for the Earnout. In the event that the Earnout is subject to
set off pursuant to _Section 2.09_, Equityholder Representative shall
promptly distribute to Parent and Paying Agent a Payment Schedule revised to
reflect that the amount payable to the Equityholders is the Earn Out less the
amount set off pursuant to _Section 2.09_. By way of clarification, the Sales
Earnout shall be paid only once, irrespective of the number of times
the conditions for the Sales Earnout are achieved. The Parties shall treat a
portion of any payment under this _Section 2.08_ as a payment of interest as
required and determined under Code Section 483 and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder.

(b) Parent shall determine Net Sales with respect to the Eligible Company
Products sold using its standard accounting procedures, consistent with GAAP.
Net Sales outside of the United States shall first be determined in the
currency in which they are earned and shall then be converted into an amount
in United States dollars using Parents customary and usual conversion
procedures used in preparing its financial statements pursuant to GAAP for the
applicable reporting period. Net Sales shall be accrued in the ordinary course
of business, in accordance with GAAP.

 

(c) Parent shall prepare a statement setting forth Net Sales for the
immediately preceding Calendar Quarter, including the number of each Eligible
Company Product sold, the Net Sales of each Eligible Company Product, and the
aggregate of all deductions from gross sales of all Eligible Company Products
(a " _Net Sales Statement_ "), and deliver the Net Sales Statements to the
Equityholders Representative promptly following the public disclosure of
Parents financial results for such Calendar Quarter (but in any event not
later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter ending
on March 31, June 30 and September 30 and ninety (90) days after each
Calendar Quarter ending on December 31). Equityholders Representative agrees
that each Net Sales Statement shall constitute the Confidential Information
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) of Parent, and that
Equityholders Representative will, and will cause its Representatives to,
hold each Net Sales Statement confidential in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) If the Equityholders Representative believes, in good faith, that the Net
Sales threshold described in _Section 2.08(a)_ was achieved, but Parent has
not delivered an Earnout Notice, the Equityholders Representative shall
promptly notify Parent in writing of its belief that such threshold has been
achieved. Following receipt of such notice, Parent and the Equityholders
Representative shall seek to resolve the dispute as to whether such threshold
was achieved pursuant to the procedures described in _Section 2.07(b)_
applied _mutatis mutandis_ to Net Sales _; provided, however,_ that all
costs, fees, and expenses arising from any matter brought before an Arbitrator
shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party.

 



27 SECTION 2.09 _Set Off Right_. Subject to _Section 9.05(a)_, the
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, in addition to any other right
hereunder, Parent and its Affiliates shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to set off up to seventy five percent (75%) of the Sales Earnout,
if payable pursuant to  _Section 2.08_, against any amounts owed at such
time by the Equityholders to the Company, Parent, or the Surviving Corporation
(or any of their Affiliates) hereunder, including amounts payable in respect
of one or more claims for indemnification by any Parent Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof; _provided_ that the claim for indemnification
is asserted prior to the required payment of the Sales Earnout pursuant to
_Section 2.08(a)_. If Parent elects to exercise its right of set off
hereunder, it shall give the Equityholders Representative written notice of
such election (the " _Set Off Notice_ "), which Set Off Notice shall include
the amount(s) to be set off from the Sales Earnout and a reasonable
description of the circumstances giving rise to Parents entitlement to such
set off. The Equityholders Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar
days after receipt of such Set Off Notice to review such Set Off Notice and,
during such thirty (30)-day period, Equityholders Representative and Parent
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any discrepancies in the set off
amount proposed by Parent. If the Equityholders Representative and Parent
are unable to so agree on the set off amount proposed by Parent during such
thirty (30)-day period, the Parent and Equityholders Representative shall
resolve such dispute in accordance with the procedure described in  _Section
12.11_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
shall be entitled to withhold and retain the amount to be set off described in
the Set Off Notice until any pending disputes as to the amount to be set
off are resolved in accordance with the preceding sentences.

(b) The adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the Stockholders Written Consent, the delivery of
the letters of transmittal pursuant to  _Section 3.03(b)_, and the execution
of the Option Holder Consent Agreements and the Warrant Holder Consent

and the irrevocable agreement of the Equityholders to be bound by and comply
with the Escrow Agreement and all of the arrangements and provisions of this
Agreement relating thereto, including the deposit of the Escrow Amount into

SECTION 3.03 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_.

(i) At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be

to the Effective Time) cash in an amount equal to (1) the Closing Date Total
Cash Consideration, _minus_ (2) the Escrow Amount, _minus_ (3) the Exercise
Amount, and _minus_ (4) the aggregate amount payable in respect of Company
Options held by Option Holders that are employees of the Company as of

the Surviving Corporation pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to such
Equityholders. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall
accrue to the benefit of such Equityholders.

(ii) Any amounts paid by or on behalf of Parent or the Escrow Agent to the
Paying Agent for distribution to Equityholders pursuant to _Section
2.07(c)(ii)_, _2.08(a)(i)_ , or _3.02(a)_ shall be deemed, for purposes of
this Agreement, to have been paid to such Equityholders by Parent and/or
Escrow Agent, as the case may be (provided, for the avoidance

 



29  of doubt, that amounts withheld pursuant to _Section 3.06_ shall be deemed
paid by Parent and/or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, to such
Equityholders) and to fully satisfy Parents obligation to such Equityholders
to pay such amounts under this Agreement, whether or not Paying Agent
subsequently distributes such amounts to such Equityholders, and such
Equityholder shall look solely to the Paying Agent for payment thereof.
Equityholders Representative shall provide to the Paying Agent and Parent,
prior to Paying Agent or Parent distributing any amounts to the Equityholders
pursuant to _Section 2.07(c)(ii)_, _2.08(a)(i)_ , or  _3.02(a)_ , a schedule
(a " _Payment Schedule_ ") setting forth (1) the percentage of such amount
payable to each Equityholder (such percentages calculated in accordance with
_Sections 2.04_ , _2.05_ and _2.06_ )) and to each Broker entitled to receive
a portion of such amount, (2) payment instructions and contact information for
each Equityholder and Broker, (3) any Tax documentation from any Equityholder

to those Equityholders that are Employee Optionholders, (B) the amount
payable in respect of such Employee Optionholders Company Options, and (C) and
the aggregate amount payable in respect of the Company Options held by all
Employee Optionholders.

 

(b) _Surrender and Payment Procedures_.

(i) Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, mail to each Company Stockholder as of
the Effective Time that has not already executed and delivered to Parent or
Paying Agent a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit I_ (a " _Stockholder Letter of Transmittal_ ") at the address
provided by the Company in the Transaction Schedule (A) a Stockholder Letter
of Transmittal and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
certificate(s) representing all of the shares of Company Capital Stock held by
such Company Stockholder in exchange for the Stock Closing Payment that is
payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented
by such certificate(s). The payment of the Stock Closing Payment with respect
to each such certificate(s) is conditioned upon (1) the execution
and delivery of such Stockholder Letter of Transmittal, (2) the delivery of
such certificates, and (3) the delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly
completed and duly executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8BEN (or suitable
substitute form) establishing an exemption from backup withholding. Promptly
after receipt by the Paying Agent of such certificate(s), properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer or cancellation, together with such duly
executed Stockholder Letter of Transmittal and IRS form, the Paying Agent
shall, in exchange therefor, pay to such Company Stockholder the Stock Closing
Payment payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented by the certificate(s) surrendered, but without interest and
subject to applicable withholding and other Taxes, and the certificate(s) so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of any portion of the
applicable Stock Closing Payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate(s) are registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment (x)
shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of those amounts to a Person other than the registered holder of the
certificate(s) surrendered, and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid, or (y) shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax is
not applicable. From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.03(b)_, each certificate

 



30  formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock shall be deemed to
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the consideration payable
in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented
thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein.

(ii) Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, mail to each holder of a Company Option
that is not an Employee Optionholder and that has not already executed and
delivered to Parent or Paying Agent a letter of transmittal in substantially
the form attached as _Exhibit J_ (an " _Option Holder Letter of Transmitta_
l"): (A) an Option Holder Letter of Transmittal and (B) instructions for use
in obtaining the Option Closing Payment. The payment of the Option Closing
Payment with respect to such Company Option is conditioned upon (1) the
execution and delivery to the Paying Agent of such Option Holder Letter of
Transmittal and (2) the delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly completed
and duly executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8BEN (or suitable substitute
form) establishing an exemption from backup withholding. Upon delivery by such
holder of such duly executed Option Holder Letter of Transmittal and duly
executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8BEN to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent
shall pay the Option Closing Amount to such holder, but without interest and
subject to applicable withholding and other Taxes.

 

(iii) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, in accordance with its
customary payroll practices, pay to each Employee Optionholder, the Option
Closing Payment payable in respect of each Company Option held by such
Employee Optionholder, but without interest and subject to applicable
withholding and other Taxes.

(iv) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, in accordance with its
customary payroll practices, pay each Cash Option Payment set forth on the
Transaction Schedule to the recipient thereof, without interest and subject to
applicable withholding and other Taxes.

 

(v) Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, mail to each holder of a Warrant that
has not already executed and delivered to Parent or Paying Agent a letter of
transmittal in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit K_ hereto (a "
_Warrant Holder Letter of Transmittal_ ") (A) and (B) instructions for use in
obtaining the Warrant Closing Payment. The payment of the Warrant Closing
Payment with respect to such Warrant is conditioned upon (1) the execution and
delivery to the Paying Agent of such Warrant Holder Letter of Transmittal and
(2) the delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly completed and duly executed
IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8BEN (or suitable substitute form) establishing an
exemption from backup withholding. Upon delivery by such holder of such duly
executed Warrant Holder Letter of Transmittal and duly executed IRS Form W-9
or IRS Form W-8BEN to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall pay the Warrant
Closing Payment to such holder, but without interest and subject to
applicable withholding and other Taxes.

SECTION 3.04 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and thereafter there

 



31  shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company
Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of the shares
of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. After the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall cancel and exchange, as
provided in _Section 3.03_, any presented certificate representing shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

SECTION 3.05 _Termination of Payment Fund; No Liability_. At any time
following the first (1st) anniversary of the date on which any funds are
delivered to the Paying Agent for distribution to the Equityholders, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any portion of such funds (including any earnings received with respect
thereto) that have not been disbursed to Equityholders and thereafter each
Equityholder shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) and only
as general creditors with respect to such Equityholders interest in such
funds, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a certificate formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock
for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
Equityholders three (3) years after the date on which any funds are delivered
to the Paying Agent (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when
the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

SECTION 3.06 _Withholding Right and Broker Fee Payment Right_.

(a) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent, and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from funds deposited in
the Escrow Fund and payments of any amount (or any portion thereof) payable
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Spin Out Agreement
to, or on behalf of, any Equityholders or the Paying Agent (for distribution
to the Equityholders) such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to such funding or the making of such payment under the
Code, any other applicable Law, or any Benefit Plan. If Parent determines that
withholding is required on any payment made by it, then Parent shall make
reasonable efforts to give notice to the Equityholders Representative
reasonably in advance of such payment of its intent to withhold and the amount
of such withholding. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Escrow Agent or the
Paying Agent shall cooperate with the Equityholders to the extent reasonable
in efforts by the Equityholders to obtain reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Escrow Agent, or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Equityholders to whom such amounts would otherwise
have been paid.

(b) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent, and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct from payment of any amount (or any
portion thereof) payable pursuant to  _Section 2.07_, _2.08_ , or the Escrow
Agreement to, or on behalf of, any

 



32  Equityholders or the Paying Agent (for distribution to the Equityholders)
any amounts required to be paid to any Person in connection with any Contract
disclosed on or that would be required to be disclosed on Section 4.23 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Broker_ "). To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and paid to a Broker by Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
Escrow Agent, or the Paying Agent, such deducted amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Equityholders.

SECTION 3.07  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
certificate(s) which formerly represented shares of Company Capital Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an
affidavit of that fact by the Company Stockholder thereof in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and Paying Agent, Parent shall instruct the Paying
Agent to pay such Company Stockholder such Company Stockholders Stock Closing
Payment as provided in  _Section 3.03(b)_; _provided, however_ , that Parent
may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to issuing such
instruction to the Paying Agent, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Paying Agent and a bond in such sum as
Parent and Paying Agent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying
Agent with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

SECTION 3.08 _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of _Section 3.03(b)_ shall
also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that
the obligations of Parent under _Section 3.03(b)_ shall commence on the date
of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for such shares the applicable amounts provided in
_Section 2.04(c)_.

SECTION 3.09 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are and will remain fully
authorized in the name of the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise to take such
action.

SECTION 3.10 _Closing Deliveries by the Company and Equityholders 

deliver or cause to be delivered to Merger Sub and Parent:

exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
Action, including, any audit or investigation by the IRS, the Department of

not yet due, have been accrued in the Interim Financial Statements to the
extent required by GAAP.

ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of

Person, or result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any
Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on Section 4.12(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no amount that could be received (whether in cash, property, the
vesting of property or otherwise) as a result of or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone
or in combination with any other event) or by any of the Ancillary Documents,
by any employee, officer, director or other service provider of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) could be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

(j) Except as set forth on Section 4.12(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company has not sponsored, maintained, participated in, or contributed

SECTION 4.14 _Real Property; Title to Assets_.

(a) Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of all real property owned by the Company (each, an " _Owned
Real Property_ "), including the address and recorded parcel number of such

Exceptions. All property and other similar taxes and assessments in respect of
the Owned Real Property have been timely paid, and there is no such
outstanding tax or assessment that is due and payable but has not yet been

notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) by the Company
or, to the Companys Knowledge, by the other party to such lease or sublease.
Each parcel of real property leased by the Company is neither subject to any

as conducted as of the Effective Time.

(e) The Company has taken all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the

SECTION 4.15 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately and
completely sets forth:

in which

 



56  such item of Registered IP has been registered or filed and the applicable
registration or serial number; (C) whether such item of Registered IP is owned
by or exclusively licensed to the Company; and (D) if such item of Registered

such item of Registered IP and the extent of such ownership interest or, if
such item of Registered IP is exclusively licensed to the Company, the Person
from which such item of Registered IP is exclusively licensed;

(ii) in Section 4.15(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each written
Contract pursuant to which the Company has received or has been granted a

Licensed IP, including a covenant-not-to-sue;

(iii) in Section 4.15(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each written

Company while onsite at the Companys facilities) pursuant to which any
Intellectual Property was developed by the Company (excluding Colorescience)
or by a third-party, including any such Contract that expressly contemplates

(b) Except for those Contracts expressly identified in Section 4.15(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is not bound by, and no Company
Owned IP or, to the Companys Knowledge, any Company Licensed IP that is
exclusively licensed to the Company is subject to, any Contract containing any
covenant or other provision that in any material way limits or restricts the
ability of the Company to use, exploit, assert, or enforce any Company
Controlled IP anywhere in the world. The Company has not transferred any
ownership interest in any Company Owned IP or any Intellectual Property that,
prior to such transfer, constituted Company Owned IP to any third-party, or
permitted any Company Owned that is used or practiced in the current conduct
of the business of the Company to enter the public 

 



57  domain (other than the publication of patents and patent applications by the
relevant patent offices or by WIPO for PCT applications) or, with respect to
Registered IP included in Company Owned IP, to lapse (other than through the
expiration of an item of Registered IP at the end of its maximum statutory
term or except as listed as abandoned or expired in Section 4.15(a)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule). The Company does not have an explicit or, to
the Companys Knowledge, implied legal obligation, absolute or contingent, to
any other Person to license, sell, transfer or assign any of the Company Owned
IP except pursuant to any Material IP Contract listed in Section 4.15(a)(iii)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) The Company exclusively owns all right, title and interest to all
Registered IP identified in Section 4.15(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule as owned by the Company and all other Intellectual Property
purportedly owned by the Company (excluding Colorescience), including all
Proprietary Names that have been adopted by the Company and are used in the
conduct of the business of the Company (other than Colorescience) and all
Intellectual Property developed or created for the Company (excluding
Colorescience) by any employee, consultant or independent contractor of the
Company, in each case, free and clear of any and all Liens. No Colorescience
Intellectual Property is used in the conduct of the business of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than Colorescience), including in connection
with the development, manufacture or sale or any Company Products. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Section
4.15(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

 

(i) each Person who is or was an employee, consultant or independent
contractor of the Company and (x) who is or was involved in the creation or
development of any Intellectual Property for the Company that is used in the
current conduct of the business of the Company, or (y) who is or was named as
an inventor on any patent application filed by or on behalf of the Company,
has signed one or more valid and enforceable agreements containing an
irrevocable assignment of that Persons rights in such Intellectual Property,
to the Company, and confidentiality provisions protecting the trade secrets
included in the Company Owned IP, and other confidential information of the
Company (excluding Colorescience), and, to the Companys Knowledge, no current
or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company
(excluding Colorescience): (A) is in violation of any term or covenant of any
Contract relating to employment, invention disclosure, invention assignment,
non-disclosure or non-competition or any other Contract with any other party
(including academic or medical institutions) by virtue of such employee,
consultant or independent contractor being employed by, or performing services
for, the Company (excluding Colorescience) or using trade secrets or
proprietary information of others without permission; or (B) has developed
any technology, software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise
proprietary work product for the Company (excluding Colorescience) that is
subject to any Contract under which such employee, consultant or
independent contractor has assigned or otherwise granted, or is obligated to
assign or otherwise grant, to any third-party any rights in or to such
technology, software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise
proprietary work product;

 

(ii) no current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of
the Company (excluding Colorescience) has any license, right (whether or not
currently exercisable), or interest to or in any Company Owned IP or other
Intellectual Property purportedly owned by the Company (excluding
Colorescience);

 



58 (iii) to the Companys Knowledge, no current or former employee, consultant,
or independent contractor who has performed services onsite at the Companys
facilities for the Company (excluding Colorescience) is in breach of any
Contract with any former employer or other Person concerning Intellectual
Property or confidentiality, where the cause or nature of the breach arises
out of the performance of any services related to the development of any
Intellectual Property by such employee, consultant, or independent contractor
on behalf of the Company (excluding Colorescience);

(iv) to the Companys Knowledge, no funding, facilities or personnel of any
Governmental Authority or any university or other educational institution
were used to develop or create, in whole or in part, any Company Owned IP or
other Intellectual Property purportedly owned by the Company (excluding
Colorescience), and no funding from any Person (other than funds received in
consideration for purchase of the capital stock of the Company) was used in
the development of such Intellectual Property. To the Companys Knowledge, no
current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of the
Company, who was involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or
development of any Company Owned IP or other Intellectual Property purportedly
owned by the Company (excluding Colorescience) and no current or former
employee, consultant or independent contractor of any licensor of any
exclusively licensed Company Licensed IP, in each case, that is used in the
current conduct of the Companys (excluding Coloresciences) business, was
employed by or has performed services for any government, university, college
or other educational or medical institution or research center during a period
of time during which such employee, consultant or independent contractor was
also performing services for the Company (excluding Colorescience) or such
licensor, as applicable; and

(v) the Company (excluding Colorescience) is not currently bound by any
agreement that obligates the Company to assign any Company Controlled IP to
any Person (it being understood that no representation and warranty is made in
this clause (v) as to any agreement to which the Company is not a party
and that the Company has not assumed or agreed to be bound by).

(d) The Company has taken reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of
and otherwise protect and enforce its rights in all trade secrets and other
confidential information included in the Company Controlled IP that is used in
the conduct of the Companys business as currently conducted (" _Confidential
IP Information_ "). All use or appropriation of Confidential IP Information by
the Company or disclosure of Confidential IP Information by the Company to a
third-party has been pursuant to the terms of a written Contract between the
Company and such third-party that requires such third-party to maintain the
confidentiality of such Confidential IP Information. All use, disclosure or
appropriation of Confidential IP Information by the Company that is not owned
by the Company has been pursuant to the terms of a written Contract between
the Company and the owner of such Confidential IP Information and in
compliance with any applicable legal obligations of the Company. All current
and former employees, independent contractors, consultants, and agents of the
Company having access to Confidential IP Information have executed and
delivered to the Company an agreement regarding the protection of such
Confidential IP Information or proprietary information (in the case of
proprietary information of the customers and business partners of the Company,
to the extent the Company has confidentiality obligations to such customers
and business partners). Without 

 



59  limiting the foregoing, (i) no employee, independent contractor, consultant,
or agent of the Company (excluding Colorescience) has misappropriated any
trade secrets of any other person in the course of performance as an
employee, independent contractor, consultant or agent of the Company
(excluding Colorescience); and (ii) to the Companys Knowledge, no employee,
independent contractor, consultant or agent of the Company (excluding
Colorescience) is in default or breach of any term of any employment
agreement, nondisclosure agreement, assignment of invention agreement or
similar agreement or contract relating in any way to the protection,
ownership, development, use or transfer of the Company IP.

(e) All rights in Intellectual Property (other than patents and trademarks)
and, to the Companys Knowledge, in patents and trademarks, sufficient to
conduct the business of the Company (excluding Colorescience) as currently
conducted and as conducted as of the Effective Time, are either (i) owned by
the Company or (ii) licensed to the Company pursuant to the Contracts listed
in Section 4.15(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(f) Each item of Registered IP (other than pending applications) included in
the Company Owned IP or, to the Companys Knowledge, any exclusively licensed
Company Licensed IP is subsisting and, to the Companys Knowledge, valid and
enforceable in all material respects, except as set forth in Sections
4.15(a)(i) and 4.15(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set
forth in Sections 4.15(a)(i) and 4.15(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all actions reasonably necessary to maintain the Registered IP
included in the Company Owned IP or, to the Companys Knowledge, any
exclusively licensed Company Licensed IP have been taken, or will be taken
prior to being prejudiced by such failure, including payment of applicable
registration, maintenance and renewal fees, filing of applicable statements of
use, timely response to office actions and disclosure of any required
information. All patents and patent applications owned by the Company
(excluding Colorescience) under which a current or former employee, contractor
or consultant of the Company (excluding Colorescience) is a named inventor
(collectively, "Company Originated Patent Rights") or, to the Companys
Knowledge, all other patents and patent applications owned by the Company or
exclusively licensed to the Company list the correct inventorship. To the
Companys Knowledge, all material documents, recordations and certificates in
connection with such patents and patent applications owned by the Company or,
to the Companys Knowledge, exclusively licensed to the Company have been
filed with the relevant patent authorities in the United States or
non-U.S. jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of prosecuting,
maintaining and perfecting such patents and patent applications. To the
Companys Knowledge, Section 4.15(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
includes a true and complete list of all actions that must be taken within
120 calendar days of the date hereof with respect to any of the Registered IP
owned by the Company (excluding Colorescience) or, to the Companys Knowledge,
exclusively licensed to the Company (excluding Colorescience). The Company
has used commercially reasonable efforts since January 1, 2012 to comply in
all material respects with all applicable notice and marking requirements for
the Registered IP included in the Company Controlled IP and Section 4.15(f)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies any claims, actions or
proceedings to which the Company is or has been a party in which it has been
asserted that the Company has not complied with such requirements. No
inequitable conduct has been committed in the prosecution of any Company
Originated Patent Rights or, to the Companys Knowledge, any other patents or
patent applications owned by the Company or exclusively licensed to
the Company and, to the Companys Knowledge, no material information was
withheld from any

 



60  Person requiring disclosure of such information during prosecution of such
patent applications or patents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each item of Registered IP owned by the Company (excluding
Colorescience) or, to the Companys Knowledge, exclusively licensed to the
Company (excluding Colorescience) is in material compliance with applicable
Law, and all filings, payments and other actions required to be made or taken
to maintain each such item of Registered IP in full force and effect have been
made or will be made by the applicable final deadline, except as listed as
abandoned or expired in Section 4.15(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and (ii) the Company (excluding Colorescience) has delivered or made
available, or will promptly after the date hereof deliver or make available,
as reasonably requested by Parent, to Parent complete and accurate copies of
all applications, material correspondence to and from U.S. and international
patent, trademark, and copyright offices or third parties, and other material
documents related to each such item of Registered IP referenced in Section
4.15(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(g) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Documents nor the consummation of any of the Transactions will,
with or without notice or the lapse of time, result in or give any other
Person the right or option to cause or assert: (i) a loss of, or Lien on, any
Company IP, or any Company IP to cease to be valid and enforceable rights of
the Company; (ii) the release, disclosure or delivery of any Company IP by any
escrow agent or to any other Person; (iii) the grant, assignment or transfer
to any other Person of any license or other material right or interest, such
as an ownership interest or covenant-not-to-sue, under, in or to any of the
Company IP; (iv) that Company is in breach of any Material IP Contract; (v)
that such Person has obtained rights under any of the Company IP or that
Parent or Merger Sub will be obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts
to any third-party in excess of those payable by Company prior to the Closing;
or (vi) the forfeiture or termination of, or give rise to a right of
forfeiture or termination of any Company IP, or impair the right of the
Company or Parent to use, possess, sell or license any Company IP or portion
thereof. Following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation will be permitted to
cause to be exercised all of the rights of the Company under the Company IP
to the same extent the Company would have been able had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred and without the payment of any
additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or
payments that the Company would otherwise be required to pay. There are no
royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments payable by the Company to any
Person (other than salaries payable to employees, consultants and independent
contractors not contingent on or related to use of their work product) under
any Contract binding on the Company as a result of the ownership, use,
possession, license-in, license-out, sale, marketing, advertising or
disposition of any Company IP by the Company (excluding any royalties or other
amounts expressly set forth in any Material IP Contract listed in Section
4.15(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any such
royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments being payable by Parent.
Following the Closing, except for any payment obligations expressly identified
in Section 4.15(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and as otherwise
restricted pursuant to the terms of the Material IP Contracts identified in
Section 4.15(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all Company Controlled IP
will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by the Surviving
Corporation without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third-
party.

 



61 (h) To the Companys Knowledge, (i) no Person has infringed, misappropriated,
or otherwise violated any Company Owned IP or Companys rights in any
exclusively licensed Company IP in any material respect and (ii) no Person is
currently infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Company
Owned IP or Companys rights in any exclusively licensed Company IP in any
material respect.

(i) The Company (excluding Colorescience), and the use of Company IP, and/or
the making, using, selling, offering to sale and importing of the Company
Products or the conduct of the Companys (excluding Coloresciences) business
has not infringed (directly, contributorily, by inducement or otherwise),
misappropriated or otherwise violated in any material respect any rights in
Intellectual Property (other than patents and trademarks) and, to the
Companys Knowledge, any patents or trademarks of any other Person. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(i) no infringement, misappropriation, or similar Action is pending or, to
the Companys Knowledge, is threatened in writing, against the Company
(excluding Colorescience);

(ii) to the Companys Knowledge, no infringement, misappropriation, or
similar Action relating to the Company IP is pending or threatened in writing
against any licensee, customer, vendor or supplier of the Company (excluding
Colorescience) who may be entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless
or reimbursed by the Company (excluding Colorescience) with respect to such
Action;

(iii) except as set forth in Section 4.15(i)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company (excluding Colorescience) has not received in the prior
three (3) years any written notice relating to any actual, alleged or
suspected infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual
Property of another Person by the Company (excluding Colorescience);

 

(iv) no Action, other than patent and trademark prosecution in the normal
course, is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened in writing
challenging the scope, ownership, validity, or enforceability of the Company
Owned IP or, to the Companys Knowledge, the exclusively licensed Company
Licensed IP and none of the Company Owned IP and, to the Companys Knowledge,
Company Licensed IP is subject to any pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
written threat with respect to an outstanding Order, stipulation, proceeding,
or notification, including any pending interference,
opposition, cancellation, reissue, reexamination, or other challenge or
adversarial proceeding, restricting in any manner the use, transfer, or
licensing by the Company of any Company Controlled IP, or which may affect the
validity, use or enforceability of any Company Controlled IP;

(v) none of the Company Owned IP and, to the Companys Knowledge, Company
Licensed IP is subject to any Contract restricting in any manner the use,
transfer, or licensing by the Company of such Company IP (other than
limitations expressly set forth in any Material IP Contract listed in Section
4.15(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), or which may affect the
validity, use or enforceability of such Company IP;

 



62 (vi) the Company (excluding Colorescience) has not received any written
opinion of counsel regarding the validity or enforceability of any
intellectual property right of a third-party or the infringement of any third-
party intellectual property as relates to Company Products; and

 

(vii) no Proprietary Name owned by the Company (excluding Colorescience) that
is used in the current conduct of the Companys business conflicts with or
infringes any Proprietary Name owned, used or applied for by any other Person
in any jurisdiction (1) where the Company currently markets or promotes any
Company Products using such Proprietary Name or (2) to the Companys
Knowledge, in which the Company presently plans to commence the marketing or
promotion of any Company Products using such Proprietary Name within the next
six (6) months.

 

(j) The Company (excluding Colorescience) is not bound by any Contract to
indemnify, hold harmless or reimburse any other Person with respect to, or
has assumed, pursuant to any Contract any existing or potential Liability of
another Person for, any infringement of Intellectual Property,
misappropriation or similar claim.

 

(k) The Company Products do not contain any known design or other defect or
error that would reasonably be expected to (i) materially and adversely
affect the use, functionality, or performance of such products; or (ii) result
in the failure in any material respect to comply with any applicable warranty
or other contractual commitment relating to the use, functionality, or
performance of such products.

(l) The Company has obtained all approvals necessary for exporting
the Company Products outside the United States in accordance with all
applicable United States export control, embargo and other regulations, and
importing such products into any country in which such products are now sold
or licensed for use, and all such export and import approvals in the United
States and throughout the world are valid, current, outstanding and in full
force and effect.

SECTION 4.16 _Taxes_.

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns_. The Company has duly and timely filed (taking
into account any extension of time within which to file) with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed. All such Tax
Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects. All Taxes due and
payable by the Company (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) have been
timely paid except for those Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which reserves have been established in
accordance with GAAP. The Company is not currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No written claim has
been made in the past three (3) years by a Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, and no such material written claim
was made in the year preceding such three (3) year period.

 

(b) _Unpaid Taxes_. The unpaid Taxes of the Company did not, as of the date of
the Interim Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set

 



63  forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes
thereto). Since the date of the Interim Financial Statements, the Company has
not incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the Ordinary Course of Business
or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

(c) _Audits, Investigations or Claims_. No deficiencies for Taxes with
respect to the Company have been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing by a
Governmental Authority that have not been settled or resolved. There are no
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, audits, assessments or other actions
for or relating to any Liability in respect of Taxes of the Company, and there
are no matters under discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect
to Taxes that are likely to result in an additional Liability for Taxes with
respect to the Company. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent
complete and accurate copies of federal, state and local income Tax Returns of
the Company for all tax years for which the statute of limitations for
assessment has not expired, and complete and accurate copies of all
examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed
to by the Company with respect to Taxes of any type. The Company has not

investigation made by Parent or its representatives hereunder shall affect the
representations and warranties of the Company hereunder. 

(d) Notwithstanding any disclosure requirements of the Company set forth in
this _Article VI_ , the Company shall not be obligated to disclose to Parent
any proprietary information to the extent such disclosure would, or would be
reasonably expected to, violate any contractual obligation of the Company or
would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to waive the attorney-
client privilege; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company: (i) shall be
entitled to withhold only such information that may not be provided without
causing such violation or waiver; (ii) shall provide to Parent all related
information that may be provided without causing such violation or waiver
(including, to the extent permitted, redacted versions of any such

any third-party to the disclosure in full of all such information to Parent;

75   _Indemnified Persons_ "), as provided in the Organizational Documents,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms for six (6) years following the Effective Time;
_provided, however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be under any obligation to cause or permit any of such Company Indemnified
Persons to be indemnified with respect to any act, omission or other matter
relating to any facts or circumstances with respect to which any Parent
Indemnified Party is entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or
reimbursed pursuant to _Article IX_.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain a prepaid directors and
officers liability insurance policy for events that have occurred prior to
the Effective Time, that shall provide the maximum amount of coverage for a

paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which premium the Company
represents and warrants to be thirty five thousand three hundred and ninety
nine dollars ($35,399)), and that shall remain in effect for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time, covering those persons that have served
as directors and officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time who are currently covered by the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail Policy_");
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall bear the cost of the DandO Tail
Policy.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.02_ shall survive the Closing and are

SECTION 6.04 _Notice to Company Stockholders; Meeting of Company
Stockholders_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement and in any
event within five (5) Business Days after such date, the Company shall
prepare an information statement in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent (as the same may be amended and supplemented from time to time, the
" _Information Statement_ ") for the Company Stockholders to approve this
Agreement and the Transactions by joining the Stockholders Written Consent.
The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing if at any time prior to
the Effective Time the Company obtains knowledge of any facts that might
make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Information
Statement in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading.
The Information Statement shall contain (i) the unanimous recommendation of
the board of directors of the Company that the Company Stockholders approve
this Agreement and the Transactions and the unanimous conclusion of the board
of directors that the terms and conditions of the Merger are fair and
reasonable to the Company Stockholders, (ii) the notices required by the
DGCL, including Sections 228(e) and 262(d)(2) thereof, and (iii) the notice of
appraisal rights required pursuant to the DGCL to Company Stockholders who may
elect to exercise such rights under the DGCL in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will provide copies of drafts of
the Information Statement to Parent and will mail the Information Statement to
Company Stockholders only after Parent and its legal counsel shall
have approved and agreed to the content of the disclosure in the Information
Statement (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Company shall not include in the Information Statement any information with
respect to Parent, Merger Sub, or their Affiliates, the form and content of
which information shall not have been approved by Parent prior to such
inclusion. Following the mailing of the Information Statement to the Company
Stockholders, the Company shall deliver by any manner permitted by the DGCL
any subsequent notice required to be delivered with respect to appraisal
rights pursuant to the DGCL.

 

(b) The Company shall cause to be delivered to each holder of Preferred Stock
any notices relating to this Agreement and the Merger required by the
Certificate of Incorporation. Prior to delivery of any such notice, the
Company shall submit to Parent such notice and shall not transmit to the
holders of Preferred Stock any such notice to which Parent reasonably
objects. 

(c) The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
Company Stockholders that have not previously executed the Stockholders
Written Consent to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger by executing
and joining the Stockholders Written Consent.

 



80 (d) Upon the written request of Parent, the Company shall duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "
_Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of approving the Merger and
adopting this Agreement and, in connection therewith, shall deliver to its
stockholders all Disclosure Materials required by applicable Law. The Company
shall, through its board of directors, recommend to the stockholders adoption
of this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting and shall solicit the approval
and adoption of this Agreement by the requisite number of stockholders as
required by the Certification of Incorporation and the DGCL.

SECTION 6.05 _Confidentiality_. 

(a) The Company agrees to, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees,
Affiliates, attorneys, investment bankers, financial advisers, and agents
(its " _Representatives_ ") to: (i) treat and hold as confidential (and not
disclose or provide access to any Person) all information relating to trade
secrets, processes, unpublished patent applications, product development,
price, customer and supplier lists, pricing and marketing plans, policies and
strategies, details of client and consultant Contracts, operations methods,
product development techniques, business acquisition plans, new personnel
acquisition plans and all other confidential or proprietary information with
respect to the Company; (ii) in the event that the Company or any such
Representative becomes legally compelled to disclose any such information,
provide Parent and Merger Sub with prompt written notice of such requirement
so that Parent or Merger Sub may seek a protective Order or other remedy or
waive compliance with this _Section 6.05_; (iii) in the event that such
protective Order or other remedy is not obtained, or Parent or Merger Sub
waives compliance with this _Section 6.05_, furnish only that portion of such
confidential information that is legally required to be provided and exercise
its best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information; and (iv) promptly furnish (prior to, at, or as soon
as practicable following, the Closing) to Parent or Merger Sub any and all
copies (in whatever form or medium) of all such confidential information then
in the possession of the Company or any of its Representatives and destroy any
and all additional copies of such information and of any analyses,
compilations, studies or other documents prepared, in whole or in part, on
the basis thereof; _provided, however_ , that this sentence shall not apply to
any information that, at the time of disclosure, is available publicly and was
not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by the Company, and the
agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers directors or
managers of the Company; and _provided further_ , that, with respect to
Company IP, specific information shall not be deemed to be within the
foregoing exception merely because it is embraced in general disclosures in
the public domain. In addition, with respect to Company IP, any combination of
features shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exception merely
because the individual features are in the public domain unless the
combination itself and its principle of operation are in the public domain.

(b) The Parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent have previously
executed the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, dated October 20, 2009 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, and which shall,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, continue in full force and effect for a period of
seven (7) years following the Closing Date. Each of Parent and the Company
will hold, and will cause its Representatives to hold any Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



81 (c) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Equityholders
Representative agrees that it and its Representatives shall hold in
confidence all Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) as if the Equityholders Representative were a party to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.06 _Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide all
notices and obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for
the execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant
to, this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and cooperate fully with
Parent and Merger Sub in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals.

(b) In addition to and not in limitation of the Companys covenants contained
in  _Section 6.06(a)_, each of the Company and Parent will (i) make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions within one (1) Business Day after the date of
this Agreement, (ii) request and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (iii) take
promptly all actions necessary to make any other filings required of such
Party under the HSR Act, (iv) comply at the earliest practicable date with
any request for additional information received by such Party or its
Affiliates from the FTC or the antitrust division of the DOJ pursuant to the
HSR Act, and (v) cooperate with the other Party in connection with the other
partys filing under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement commenced by either the FTC or the antitrust division of the
DOJ or state attorney general. Parent shall pay any filing fees due in
connection with the filings to be made under the HSR Act. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company and Parent shall each be responsible for its own
legal fees for preparing its portion of the HSR Act filings.

(c) The Company shall give promptly such notices to third parties and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such third-party consents and
estoppel certificates as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable in connection with the Transactions, including obtaining the
approvals, waivers, ratifications, or similar consents listed on _Schedule
8.02(f)_.

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, or if any suit is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the antitrust division of the DOJ
or any other Governmental Authority or any third-party challenging any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or which would otherwise
prohibit or materially impair or materially delay such transaction, each of
Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of such
transactions; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall have any
obligation to commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate
arrangements or similar actions, including conditions affecting business
operations or practices, on its own behalf or on behalf of any shareholder or
Affiliate.

 



82 SECTION 6.07 _Notice of Developments_. From the date hereof and continuing
until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other party in writing of (a)
any event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to result in any
representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any respect so as to cause the Closing condition set forth in
_Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_, respectively, to fail to be satisfied, (b)
the failure by it to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, (c) with
respect to the Company, any change or event having, or which is reasonably
likely to have, alone or in combination with other changes or events, a
Material Adverse Effect or (d) with respect to the Company, any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification will be deemed to
prevent or cure any breach of, or inaccuracy in, amend or supplement any
Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or otherwise disclose an exception
to, or affect in any manner, the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the Parties or the Equityholders under
this Agreement.

SECTION 6.08 _No Solicitation_. 

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 11.01_, the Company
shall not take nor shall the Company permit any of the Companys
Representatives to take (directly or indirectly) any of the following actions
with any Person other than Parent and its designees: (i) solicit, initiate,
facilitate or encourage any proposal or offer from, or participate or engage
in or conduct any discussions or negotiations with, any Person relating to any
inquiry, contact, offer or proposal, oral, written or otherwise, formal or
informal, with respect to any possible Business Combination with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Competing Proposed Transaction_ "); (ii)
provide any information with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
or its business to any Person other than Parent, relating to (or which the
Company believes would be used for the purpose of formulating an offer or
proposal with respect to), or otherwise assist, cooperate with, facilitate
or encourage any effort or attempt by any such Person with regard to, any
possible Business Combination with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(iii) approve or agree to or enter into a Contract with any Person other than
Parent providing for a Business Combination with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (iv) make or authorize any statement, recommendation,
solicitation or endorsement in support of any possible Business Combination
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the Business
Combination with Parent contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents; or (v) authorize or permit any of the Companys Representatives to
take any such action.

 

(b) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any such
contacts or negotiations with any Person relating to any such transaction or
Business Combination. In addition to the foregoing, if (after this Agreement
is signed and delivered by the Company and prior to the Effective Time or the
earlier termination of this Agreement in 

 



83  accordance with _Section 11.01_) the Company receives any offer or proposal
(formal or informal, oral, written or otherwise) relating to, or any inquiry
or contact from any Person with respect to, a Competing Proposed Transaction,
the Company shall immediately notify Parent thereof and provide Parent with
the details thereof, including the identity of the Person or Persons making
such offer, proposal, inquiry or contact and shall keep Parent fully informed
on a current basis of the status and details of any such offer or proposal and
of any modifications to the terms thereof; _provided, however_ , that this
provision shall not in any way be deemed to limit the obligations of the
Company and its Representatives set forth in _Section 6.08(a)_.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledge that this _Section 6.08_ was
a significant inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement and the
absence of such provision would have resulted in either (i) a material
reduction in the consideration to be paid to the Equityholders in the Merger
or (ii) a failure to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement.

SECTION 6.09  _Transaction Schedule_. Not more than five (5) Business Days
nor fewer than two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide to Parent a Transaction Schedule updated through the Effective
Date.

 

SECTION 6.10 _Termination of the Stock Plan_. Unless otherwise requested by
Parent prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to terminate the Stock Plan prior to the Closing, and no further
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock or other rights with respect to
Shares shall be granted thereunder.

 

SECTION 6.11 _Termination of Benefit Plans_. Unless otherwise notified by
Parent, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to terminate
any Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code,
effective not later than the last Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, and any other Benefit Plan Parent requests that the
Company terminate prior to the Closing, effective not later than immediately
preceding the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to terminate any Benefit Plan to the extent the notice requirements
under such Benefit Plan would make termination of such Benefit Plan prior to
the Closing Date impracticable or to the extent termination of such Benefit
Plan would be prohibited by Applicable Law. The Company shall provide Parent
with (i) evidence that each such Benefit Plan has been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the board of directors of the Company (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the
applicable time set forth above, and (ii) an executed amendment to any such
plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the
Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of any such
plan will be maintained at the time of termination.

 

SECTION 6.12 _Delivery of Financial Statements; Cooperation in Preparing Pro
Forma Financial Statements_. From the date hereof until the Closing, the
Company will deliver to Parent, not later than eight (8) Business Days after
the end of each calendar month, an unaudited, consolidated balance sheet as of
the end of such month and an unaudited, consolidated statement of income for
such month. The Company covenants and agrees that such financial statements
and the notes thereto, if any, shall be complete and accurate in all material
respects and fairly present in all material respects the financial condition
of the Company on a consolidated basis at the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of its operations for the respective

 



84  months then ended, and shall be prepared in accordance with the books and
records of the Company in conformity with GAAP, consistently applied with the
financial statements referred to in  _Section 4.08_ and the accounting
principles described on _Schedule E_ , except for the omission of footnotes
and normal, immaterial year-end adjustments. At Parents expense, the Company
agrees to cooperate, and cause its accountants to cooperate, in providing (a)
historical financial information to Parent in a manner for Parent to satisfy
its filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (b) any
related supporting schedules in the format reasonably required by Parent for
use by its Subsidiaries at such time (and as may be updated by Parent in its
reasonable discretion from time to time), and (c) any other information
reasonably requested by Parent in order to comply with the requirements of

Agreement.

share acquisition" statute or other similar anti-takeover statute or

SECTION 6.16 _Section 280G of the Code_.

(a) Parent and the Company acknowledge that the consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement and certain other amounts which may be received by
any Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("Section
280G")). The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to the
solicitation of the requisite Company Stockholder approval described in
_Section 6.16(b)_, a Section 280G Waiver from each Person who is a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G), as determined
immediately prior to the initiation of the solicitation of the requisite
Company Stockholder approval described in _Section 6.16(b)_, and who might
otherwise receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a parachute
payment under Section 280G in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, unless the requisite Company Stockholder approval of such
parachute payments is obtained pursuant to _Section 6.16(b)_.

 



85 (b) As soon as practicable following the delivery by the Company to Parent of
the Section 280G Waiver, the Company shall submit to the Company Stockholders
for approval in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any payments
and/or benefits that are subject to a Section 280G Waiver, such that
such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments"
under Section 280G, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver
to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent (i) that a
Company Stockholder vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G, and
the requisite Company Stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any
payments and/or benefits that were subject to the Company Stockholder vote
(the " _Section 280G Approval_ ") or (ii) that the Section 280G Approval was
not obtained and as a consequence, pursuant to the Section 280G Waiver, such
"parachute payments" shall not be made or provided.

 

(c) The form of the Section 280G Waiver and any materials to be submitted to
the Company Stockholders in connection with the Section 280G Approval (the "
_Section 280G Soliciting Materials_ ") shall be subject to review and approval
by Parent. The Company will promptly advise Parent if at any time prior to the
Closing the Company shall obtain Knowledge of any facts that might make it

Materials in order to make statements contained or incorporated by reference
therein not misleading or to comply with applicable Law.

offers of employment as soon as reasonably practicable following the

With respect to any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who receives
such an offer of continued employment from Parent, the Company
shall cooperate in good faith with the Surviving Corporation, Parent, or any
of Parents Subsidiaries in their efforts to provide offer letters to such
employees as soon as practicable after the date hereof and in any event prior

Effective Time. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any obligation to make an offer of continued employment to any employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Effective no later than immediately prior
to the Closing, the Company shall, consistent with applicable Law, terminate
the employment of each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries to whom
offers of continued employment have not and will not be extended.

(b) _Service Credit; Waiver of Pre-Existing Condition Limitations; Etc._
Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to: (i) credit each Continuing Employee for their past service with the
Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Parents 401(k),
medical, vision and dental plans (except to the extent such service

 



86  credit will result in benefit accruals or the duplication of benefits); (ii)
grant the Continuing Employees such service credit for purposes of Parents
vacation leave and severance policies (except (x) to the extent such service
credit will result in benefit accruals or the duplication of benefits and (y)

Contributions" under the Parents Savings and Investment Plan); (iii) cause

Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents; and (iv) provide
Continuing Employees with credit for any co-payments, deductibles and offsets
made during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs (in each case,
only to the extent information reasonably necessary to determine and credit
such amounts is either provided by or made available from the Continuing
Employees, records of the Company, insurance providers or third-party
administrators) for the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out
of pocket, or similar requirements under any Parent Benefit Arrangements in
which they are eligible to participate after the Closing Date.

(c) _Terms of Continuing Employment_. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of Parents Subsidiaries employing a Continuing
Employee to, for the period immediately following the Effective Time through
and including the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, use good
faith efforts to provide any Continuing Employee with base salary that is not
less than substantially equivalent in value to the base salary currently
provided by the Company to such Continuing Employee, and employee benefits
(including vacation and leave, and employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements (including medical, dental, vision, accident, life,
disability and other employee welfare benefits)) and incentive compensation
opportunities that are in the aggregate not less than substantially
equivalent in value to the employee benefits and incentive compensation
(excluding equity compensation) opportunities currently provided by Parent to
similarly situated employees of Parent.

 

(d) _Unpaid Amounts_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor, assume and agree to perform, in accordance with their terms, as they
may be amended pursuant to their terms, all individual employment, severance
and change of control agreements, plans or arrangements between the Company
and any Company Employee in existence on the date hereof to the extent the
Companys executory obligations thereunder survive the Closing or have not
been terminated, superseded and/or completely satisfied as of the Closing.

 

(e) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Restrictions_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary: (i) except as set forth in Section
6.17(c), nothing in this _Section 6.17_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of Parents Subsidiaries
from changing its compensation structure or employee benefit programs or
obligating Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of Parents Subsidiaries
to provide any particular type or amount of compensation or benefits to any
Company Employee, (ii) nothing in this _Section 6.17_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed (A) as resulting in any Company Employee who was
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a Company Employee residing in the
United States being employed other than on an "at will" basis or any other
Company Employee being employed other than pursuant to a standard notice

 



87  contained in a written contract or applicable local regulations, or (B) as
obligating Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of Parents Subsidiaries
to employ any Company Employee for any length of time following the Effective
Time; and (iii) no Company Employee, and no beneficiary of any Company
Employee, shall be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII 

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.01 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. Except to the extent
otherwise required under applicable Law, the Parties shall treat the taxable
year of the Company as ending for all Tax purposes at the end of the day on
the Closing Date. The Equityholders Representative shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and file or cause to be timely filed all income and franchise Tax
Returns for the Company for the Tax Period ending on the day of the Closing
Date (each, a " _Final Pre-Closing Income Tax Return_ "). Unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, the Tax consequences resulting from the Spin Out
shall be reflected on the Final Pre-Closing Income Tax Return and, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, the Equityholders Representative shall
prepare such Final Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the past practice of the Company. Each Final Pre-Closing Income Tax
Return shall be submitted to Parent for review and comment within one hundred
fifty (150) days following the Closing Date and the Equityholders
Representative shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments made by
Parent prior to the filing of such Tax Return. Parent shall prepare and
timely file all other Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Colorescience) (each, a " _Parent Prepared Tax Return_ ") that are
due after the Closing Date with respect to any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date and any Straddle Period (for the avoidance of doubt, other
than any Tax Returns that Colorescience is obligated to prepare pursuant to
Section 1.8(b) of the Spin Out Agreement). Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, Parent shall prepare such Parent Prepared Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the past practices of the Company. If the Equityholders
may be liable under this Agreement for any Taxes due with respect to such
Parent Prepared Tax Returns, Parent shall submit such Parent Prepared Tax
Returns to the Equityholders Representative for his review and comment at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return
(including extensions) and Parent shall revise such Tax Return to reflect any
reasonable comments made by the Equityholders Representative prior to the
filing of such Tax Return; provided, however, that to the extent that both (i)
such Tax Return is a Straddle Period return and (ii) the majority of the
taxes payable for such Straddle Period are not allocable to the portion of
such period ending on the Closing Date, then Parent need only consider in good
faith any comments made by the Equityholders Representative prior to the
filing of such Tax Return.

SECTION 7.02 _Tax Cooperation_. Parent, the Company, the Equityholders
Representative and the Equityholders shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to this 

 



89  Agreement and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Parent, the Company, the Equityholders Representative and the Equityholders
agree (a) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority; (b)
to deliver or make available to Parent, within sixty (60) calendar days after
the Closing Date, copies of all such books and records; and (c) to give the
other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Parent, the Company, the Equityholders Representative and the Equityholders,
as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession or to
prepare copies of such books and records at such other partys expense.

SECTION 7.03 _Contest Provisions_. If, subsequent to the Closing, Parent or
the Company receives notice of any audit, other administrative proceeding or
inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes with respect to any Tax Return
for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period
(a " _Tax Contest_ "), then within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt
of such notice, Parent shall notify the Equityholders Representative of such
notice. The Equityholders Representative shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of any Tax Contest, _provided, however_ , that if any
of the issues raised in such Tax Contest could have an adverse impact on Taxes
of Parent or the Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period, then the
Equityholders Representative shall afford Parent the opportunity to control
jointly the conduct and resolution of the portion of such Tax Contest that
could have such an impact. If the Equityholders Representative shall have the
right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but elects in
writing not to do so, then Parent shall have the right to control the conduct
and resolution of such Tax Contest, _provided, however_ , that Parent shall
keep the Equityholders Representative reasonably informed of all material
developments in such Tax Contest on a timely basis. Neither the Equityholders
Representative nor Parent shall resolve any Tax Contest in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the other Partys Tax
obligations or indemnification obligations under this Agreement without the
other Partys written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

SECTION 7.04 _Amended Returns_. Except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, Parent shall not, nor shall Parent cause or permit its Affiliates to
without the prior written consent of the Equityholders Representative,
amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

 

SECTION 7.05 _Parent Actions_. Parent shall not make an election under Section
338 of the Code or any comparable provision in any other jurisdiction with
respect to the purchase of the capital stock of the Company, and the Company
shall (and Parent shall cause the Company) not to take any actions or engage
in any transactions on the Closing Date other than actions or transactions
that are in the Ordinary Course of Business or are necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



90 SECTION 7.06 _Refunds_. The Equityholders shall be entitled to have added to
the Escrow Fund the amount of any refund or credit of Taxes of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that is received by Parent or its Subsidiaries prior
to the date on which the Escrow Fund has been exhausted to the extent such
Taxes were paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the Closing
Date, which refund or credit is actually recognized by Parent or its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on or
after the Closing Date and prior to the date on which the Escrow Fund has
been exhausted, net of any cost to Parent or its Subsidiaries attributable to
the obtaining and receipt of such a refund or credit, except to the extent
such refund or credit arises as a result of a carryback of a loss or
other tax benefit from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date, or was included as an asset in the calculation of the Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to the Closing Statement.
Parent shall deposit in the Escrow Fund any such amount to be added to the
Escrow Fund pursuant to the prior sentence within ten (10) Business Days of
the receipt or recognition of the applicable refund or credit by Parent or its
Subsidiaries. To the extent requested by the Equityholders Representative,
Parent or its Subsidiaries will reasonably cooperate with the Equityholders
Representative in obtaining such refund or credit (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include any refund or credit with respect to a Colorescience
Tax Return), including through the filing of amended Tax Returns for periods
ending before or on the Closing Date or refund claims.

SECTION 7.07 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the
Equityholders and fifty percent (50%) by Parent, and the Equityholders will,
at their own expense, prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by
applicable Law, Parent will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

Fully Diluted Shares held by each Equityholder immediately prior to the

connected with any of the following (each a " _Parent Claim_ "):

(a) any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or

Agreement, any Ancillary Document, or in any other certificate or other
instrument executed in connection with the Transactions by the Company or
the Equityholders Representative to be true and correct in all respects as

Company in this Agreement);

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made or to
be performed by the Equityholders, the Company or the Equityholders
Representative in this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, or in any other

entered into on or prior to the Closing Date, under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as
a transferee or successor by Contract or otherwise, but excluding any Tax

(g) any of the matters described on _Schedule 9.02(g)_.

 

SECTION 9.03 _Indemnification of Equityholder Indemnified Parties_. Parent,
Merger Sub and, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation hereby agree
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, jointly and severally, each
Equityholder Indemnified Party against and in respect of, and to pay the
Equityholder Indemnified Parties the amount of, any and all Damages that
are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Equityholder
Indemnified Parties or to which any of the Equityholder Indemnified Parties
may otherwise become directly or indirectly subject (regardless of whether or
not such Damages relate to any Third-Party Claim), and that arise from or as
a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with either of the
following (each an " _Equityholder Claim_ "):

 

(a) any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or
warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any document,

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement.

SECTION 9.04 _Damages of Company_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, if
the Company suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a
result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Equityholders, the
Company or the Equityholders Representative, then (without limiting any of
the rights of the Company as a Parent Indemnified Party), Parent and Merger
Sub shall also be deemed, by virtue of their ownership of the stock of the
Company following the Closing, to have incurred Damages as a result of and in
connection with such inaccuracy or breach (it being understood that any
Damages suffered or incurred by the Company shall be recoverable under this
_Article IX_ by either Parent, Merger Sub or the Company).

 



97 SECTION 9.05 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and except for
the proviso in this sentence, no Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to indemnification for any Damages arising solely from a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ until the aggregate amount of
all Damages under all claims of all Parent Indemnified Parties for all
such breaches shall exceed one million seven hundred fifty thousand dollars
($1,750,000) (the " _Basket_ "), at which time all Damages incurred shall be
subject to indemnification hereunder, including the amount of the Basket; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set forth in this _Section
9.05(a)_ shall not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ based on any inaccuracy in or breach of
any Fundamental Representation or Tax Representation.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other
than Parents set off rights pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and the proviso in
this sentence, the Equityholders aggregate liability for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.02_ shall not exceed the Escrow Amount (including any
Escrow Amounts returned to the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 9.05(g)_ and
any amounts added to the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 7.06)_, plus any
interest accrued on the Escrow Fund, and any Damages that any
Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to recover pursuant to _Section 9.02_
shall be payable solely from the Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , the
foregoing limitation shall not apply for any claim for indemnification that is
asserted with respect to the matters set forth on _Schedule 9.05(b)_ , with
respect to which the liability of each Equityholder shall not exceed the
proceeds received or payable to such Equityholder in connection with the
Merger.

 

(c) The Equityholders shall not be obligated to indemnify any Parent
Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages to the extent that such Damages
(i) were reflected as a liability in the Closing Date Balance Sheet for
purposes of Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.07_, (ii) relate to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries attributable
to taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date, (iii)
resulted from the Spin Out and were included in the Spin Out Taxable Gain
Adjustment or (iv) result from or arise out of any reduction or limitation on
the use of any Tax attribute of the Company or its Subsidiaries attributable
to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that subsection (iv) of this  _Section 9.05(c)_
shall not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.02(a)_ based on any inaccuracy in or breach of the representation
set forth in _Section 4.16(m)_.

 

(d) Any indemnification provided by the Equityholders or Parent pursuant to
this _Article IX_ will be calculated after deduction of amounts actually paid
by an unaffiliated Person (including any unaffiliated third-party insurer to a
Parent Indemnified Party or Equityholder Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, or any of such Parent Indemnified Partys or Equityholder Indemnified
Partys, as the case may be, Affiliates), to the extent such amounts relate
directly to the Damages giving rise to such Parent Indemnified Partys or
Equityholder Indemnified Partys, as the case may be, claim
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.02_ or _9.03_ , as applicable (it
being agreed that any payments from any Affiliate of such Parent Indemnified
Party or Equityholder Indemnified Party, as the case may be, in the nature
of self-insurance shall not be deemed to have been received from an
unaffiliated third-party insurer). By way of clarification, nothing in this
_Section 9.05(d)_ shall require any Parent Indemnified Party, any
Equityholder Indemnified Party, or any of their Affiliates to obtain or
maintain insurance.

 



98 (e) If a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to recover Damages pursuant to
this _Article IX_ , such Damages shall be paid to such Parent Indemnified
Party in cash from the Escrow Fund until the Escrow Fund is wholly exhausted.

(f) A Parent Indemnified Partys Damages in connection with a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.02(g)_ for that Action set forth as
Item 1 on _Schedule 9.02(g)_  (the " _Designated Action_ ") shall be subject
to the limitations set forth on _Schedule 9.06(b)_.

(g) The amount that the Equityholders or Parent is or may be required to
provide indemnification pursuant to this Article IX shall be (i) increased to
take into account any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising
from the receipt or accrual of an indemnification payment hereunder (grossed
up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take into account any net Tax
benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from incurring or
paying such loss or other liability. In computing the amount of any such Tax
cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all
other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any
item arising from the receipt or accrual of any indemnification payment
hereunder or incurring or paying any indemnified Damages. Any indemnification
payment hereunder shall initially be made without regard to this _Section
9.05(g)_ and shall be increased or reduced to reflect any such Tax cost
(including gross-up) or net Tax benefit only after the Indemnified Party has
actually realized such cost or benefit. For purposes of this Agreement, an
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax
cost or net Tax benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount
of Taxes payable by such Indemnified Party is increased above or reduced
below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes that such Indemnified Party
would be required to pay but for the receipt or accrual of the
indemnification payment or the incurrence or payment of such Damages, as the
case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any claim for
indemnification by a Parent Indemnified Party, no increases or reductions to
indemnification payments pursuant to this Section 9.05(g) shall be made after
the date on which the Escrow Fund has been exhausted. In the event of any such
increase or reduction to an indemnification payment determined pursuant to
this _Section 9.05(g)_ prior to the date on which the Escrow Fund has been
exhausted (A) in the case of a reduction, such reduction shall be promptly
deposited into the Escrow Fund by such Parent Indemnified Party and (B)
in the case of an increase, Parent and Equityholders Representative shall
promptly deliver written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund such increase, to the extent
funds are available in the Escrow Fund to do so.

SECTION 9.06 _Notification of Certain Claims; Third-Party Claims_. Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 7.03_:

(a) If a Parent Indemnified Party is of the reasonable opinion that any Parent
Claim has occurred or will occur, an authorized officer or representative of
such Parent Indemnified Party, as applicable, may so notify the Equityholders
Representative. Each such notice shall be in writing and shall describe with
reasonable specificity, and to the extent known by the applicable Parent
Indemnified Party, the nature of such Parent Claim and the amount of Damages
related thereto.

 



99 (b) If a Parent Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action (each,
a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim for Damages under
this _Article IX_, Parent will, promptly after receipt of notice of any such
Action, audit, demand or assessment, notify the Equityholders Representative
of the commencement thereof. The failure to so notify the Equityholders
Representative of the commencement of any such Action will not relieve any
Equityholder from liability in connection therewith, except to the extent
that such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of such
Equityholder to defend its interests in such Action. Parent shall have the
right in its sole discretion to assume and control the defense or settlement
of such Action; _provided_  that the Equityholders Representative and its
counsel (at Equityholders Representatives sole expense) may participate in
(but not control the conduct of) the defense of such Action, _provided
further_ that, except with the reasonable consent of the Equityholders
Representative, no settlement of any such Action with third-party claimants
shall be conclusively determinative of the amount of Damages relating to such
matter. In the event that the Equityholders Representative has consented to
any such settlement, the Equityholders shall have no power or authority to
object under any provision of this _Article IX_ to the amount of any such
Parent Claim with respect to such settlement. In the event Parent is,
directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third-Party
Claim, the Equityholders Representative and the Equityholders shall cooperate
with the Parent Indemnified Party in such defense and make available
to Parent, at the Equityholders expense, all such witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Equityholders Representatives or
Equityholders, as the case may be, possession or under the
Equityholders Representatives or Equityholders, as the case may be,
control relating thereto as is reasonably required by Parent. By way of
clarification, this Section 9.06(b) shall not apply with respect to the
Designated Action, which shall be governed by the procedure set forth on
_Schedule 9.06(b)_.

SECTION 9.07 _Treatment of Adjustments_. The Equityholders, on the one hand,
and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree that all payments made by
or on behalf of either of them to or for the benefit of the other (including
any payments to the Company) under this _Article IX_ shall be treated as
adjustments to the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement for Tax
purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof. If,
notwithstanding the treatment required by the preceding sentence,
any indemnification payment under this _Article IX_ is determined to be
taxable to the recipient by any Governmental Authority, the payor shall also
indemnify the recipient for any Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt of
such payment and any Damages incurred by the recipient in connection with
such Taxes.

SECTION 9.08 _No Right of Contribution from Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company_. Other than the rights and obligations of certain Equityholders set
forth in the indemnification agreement and escrow agreement to be entered into
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) of the Spin Out Agreement, each
Equityholder waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Equityholder shall
not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert),
any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, assigns
or successors, for any indemnification claims asserted by any Parent
Indemnified Parties in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which such Equityholder may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement, it being acknowledged and agreed that the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Equityholders
are solely for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified Parties.

 



100  SECTION 9.09 _Investigation; No Company Recourse_. The right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Equityholders, the Company or the
Equityholders Representative in this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, or
any other document, certificate or other instrument required to be delivered
by the Equityholders, the Company or the Equityholders Representative under
this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted (or
capable of being conducted) by any Parent Indemnified Party or any other
Person at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
by any Parent Indemnified Party or any other Person at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition
to Closing based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall not
affect the right to indemnification or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

SECTION 9.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, except for Parents set off rights pursuant to
_Section 2.09_ or as expressly set forth otherwise herein, this _Article IX_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties and
the Equityholder Indemnified Parties from and after the Closing Date for any
claims arising under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document (other than any
General Release and Indemnity Agreement, Employment Agreement, Protection
Agreement, Option Holder Consent Agreement, Warrant Holder Consent Agreement,
Cash Option Payment Agreement, or Transition Services Agreement), including
claims of inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made
therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing sentence shall not be
deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance
or injunctive or equitable relief, any right or remedy arising from a
criminal Action, or any right or remedy arising by reason of any claim of
fraud with respect to this Agreement or any Ancillary Document.

instruction from, each and all of the Equityholders. Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company may, and the Escrow Agent and Paying Agent will, disregard any
notice or instruction received from any one or more individual Equityholders,
other than the Equityholders Representative.

 



103  SECTION 10.05 _Liability of Equityholders  Representative; Payment of
Costs; Equityholders Representatives Fund Amount_.

(a) The Equityholders Representative shall not be personally liable as the
Equityholders Representative to any Equityholder for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Equityholders Representative or error in judgment, in each case
while acting in good faith, except for any act done or omitted
which represents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Equityholders
Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public
accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue,
and any error in judgment or other act or failure to act on the part of the
Equityholders Representative pursuant to such advice shall not subject the
Equityholders Representative to Liability to any Equityholder. The
Equityholders Representative undertakes to perform such duties and only such
duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Equityholders Representative. Each of the Equityholders hereby severally,
and not jointly, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Equityholders Representative and any of its representatives and agents from
and against any Damages or expenses incurred or paid by the Equityholders
Representative arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Equityholders Representatives duties (except as caused
by the Equityholders Representatives fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct), including legal costs and expenses of defending the
Equityholders Representative against any claim or Liability in connection
with the performance of the Equityholders Representatives duties under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and the Paying Agent Agreement ("
_Equityholders  Representative Costs_"). Following the Closing, the
Equityholders Representative shall be entitled to, at any time and from
time to time, reimbursement from the Equityholders for the Equityholders
Representative Costs. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to
the Equityholders Representative under this Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Equityholders
Representative the Equityholders Representatives Fund Amount, which shall
be held by the Equityholders Representative in trust solely for the purpose
of paying the Equityholders Representative Costs (the " _Equityholders 
Representatives Fund_"). The deposit of the Equityholders Representatives
Fund Amount by Parent with the Equityholders Representative shall discharge
Parents obligations with respect to such amount, and Parent shall not
have responsibility or Liability for the manner in which the Equityholders
Representative administers the Equityholders Representatives Fund, or for
causing or ensuring that all or any portion of the
Equityholders Representatives Fund Amount is ultimately paid or distributed
to the Equityholders. Upon the Equityholders Representatives determination
to release the Equityholders Representatives Fund Amount then remaining, if
any, such remaining Equityholders Representatives Fund Amount shall be
distributed to Equityholders in the amounts described in _Sections
2.04(c)(vii)_ , _2.05(a)(viii)_ , and _2.06(g)_ and in accordance with
applicable Law. 

SECTION 10.06 _Reliance on Equityholders  Representative_. Parent, Merger
Sub, their respective Affiliates, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to rely on the appointment of the Equityholders Representative
and treat such Equityholders Representative as the duly appointed attorney-
in-fact of each Equityholder and as having the duties, powers and authority
provided for in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Company), the Escrow Agent, nor Paying Agent shall be
liable to any Equityholder for any actions taken or omitted by them in
reliance upon any instructions, notice, documents or other instruments
delivered by the Equityholders Representative.

 



104  SECTION 10.07 _Resignation; Replacement_.

 

(a) _Resignation_. No resignation of the Equityholders Representative shall
become effective unless at least twenty (20) calendar days prior written
notice of the replacement or resignation of such Equityholders Representative
shall be provided to Parent, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent and the Paying
Agent.

 

(b) _Replacement_. From and after the Closing until the date when all
obligations under this Agreement have been discharged (including all
indemnification obligations under _Article IX_ hereof), Equityholders who were
entitled to receive in excess of sixty-seven percent (67)% of the Closing Date
Total Cash Consideration payable to the former holders of Preferred Stock (a
" _Supermajority_ "), may, from time to time upon written notice to the
Equityholders Representative, Parent, Escrow Agent, and Paying Agent, remove
any Equityholders Representative or appoint a new Equityholders
Representative to fill any vacancy created by the death, incapacitation,
resignation or removal of any Equityholders Representative. If an
Equityholders Representative has resigned or has been removed, and
a Supermajority has not delivered written notice to Parent, Escrow Agent, and
Paying Agent designating a successor Equityholders Representative within ten
(10) Business Days from the effective time of such resignation or removal,
Parent shall have the right to appoint an Equityholders Representative to
fill any such vacancy from the directors or officers of the Company prior to
the Closing (or if no such director or officer is, at such time, willing or
able to accept such appointment, any Person reasonably selected by Parent),
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to advise Equityholders
constituting a Supermajority of such appointment by written notice; _provided,
however,_ that a Supermajority shall thereafter retain the right to remove
the Equityholders Representative or appoint a new Equityholders
Representative pursuant to this _Section 10.07_. Each successor
Equityholders Representative shall have all of the power, authority, rights
and privileges conferred upon, and be subject to the obligations of, the
original Equityholders Representative under this Agreement, and the term
"Equityholders Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include any
successor Equityholders Representative. Upon the request of Parent, Paying
Agent, or Escrow Agreement, any successor Equityholders Representative shall
promptly execute and deliver to Parent, Paying Agent, and Escrow Agent an
acknowledgement of its agreement to be bound by and subject to the terms of
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and the Paying Agent Agreement.

material breach of this Agreement or if such breach by the Parent or Merger
Sub is cured such that such conditions would then be satisfied);

 

(d) by Parent if there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company or any event shall have occurred or circumstance shall
exist that, in combination with any other events or circumstances, could
reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect with

(e) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other Party, if the Merger shall not
have been consummated on or prior to January 31, 2013, unless the failure to
consummate the Merger on or prior to such date is the result of (i) any breach

the terms of this _Section 11.01(e)_; or (ii) any objections asserted with
respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, or the institution of any suit

Stockholders Written Consent is not delivered to Parent within one (1)
Business Day after the date of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.02 _Effect of Termination_. If a Party wishes to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.01_, then such Party shall deliver to the
other Parties to this Agreement a written notice stating that such Party is
terminating this Agreement and setting forth a brief description of the basis
on which such Party is terminating this Agreement. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect, except (i) as set forth in  _Sections 6.05(b)_ and _(c)_ , this
_Section 11.02_ and _Article XII_, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any Party

SECTION 12.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced as a result of any rule of
law or public policy, all other terms and other provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or

adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the greatest extent
possible.

to herein (including the Ancillary Documents and the Spin Out Agreement),
comprises the entire agreement of the Parties, and all promises,
representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to
the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this
Agreement relied upon by all the Parties hereto, have been expressed herein
or in such Company Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits or such other
agreements and this Agreement, including such Company Disclosure Schedule,
Schedules, Exhibits and such other agreements, supersedes any prior
understandings, negotiations, agreements or representations by or among the
Parties, written or oral, to the extent they related in any way to the subject
matter hereof or thereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms or
provisions hereof are binding upon or enforceable against any Party hereto
unless and until the same is executed and delivered by all of the Parties
hereto.

 



109  SECTION 12.05 _Successors and Assigns_. All covenants and agreements and
other provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any
of the Parties hereto shall bind, and inure to the benefit of, the successors
(including any successor by merger, consolidation or division), heirs and
permitted assigns of such Party. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights
or obligations hereunder may be assigned by the Equityholders Representative
or the Company without the prior written consent of Parent, or assigned by
Parent or Merger Sub without the prior written consent of the Company (prior
to the Closing) or the Equityholders Representative (after the Closing), such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, _provided_ , that Parent and Merger
Sub (including the Surviving Corporation) may, without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Company or the Equityholders Representative, assign
any of its rights, or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement to
any Affiliate of Parent so long as Parent also remains obligated for the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement. The Equityholders
Representative shall execute such acknowledgments of such assignments in such
forms as Parent or Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation) may
from time to time reasonably request. Any purported assignment or delegation
of rights or obligations in violation of this _Section 12.05_ is void and of
no force or effect.

 

SECTION 12.06 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except (i) prior
to the Closing, by in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Parties hereto and (ii) after the Closing, by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent and Equityholders Representative. Subject
to the foregoing and applicable Law, any provision of this Agreement may be
amended prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, after adoption of this
Agreement by the Company Stockholders and without their further approval, no
amendment may be made which under applicable Law requires such approval. 

SECTION 12.07 _Waiver_. Each Party to this Agreement may: (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
Parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered by the other
Party or Parties pursuant hereto; or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other Parties or conditions to such Parties obligations
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby.
Except where a specific period for action or inaction is provided herein,
neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any Party in exercising any
right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the
part of any Party of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or
privilege. The failure of a Party to exercise any right conferred herein
within the time required shall cause such right to terminate with respect to
the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not to any
such right arising as a result of any other transactions or circumstances.

SECTION 12.08  _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement and all of its
conditions and provisions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
nothing in this Agreement (except as provided in this _Section 12.08_),
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, including any
union or any employee or former employee of the Company, other than the
Parties hereto any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever,

 



110   including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by
reason of this Agreement or any provision hereof; _provided, however_ , that
the Company Indemnified Persons are entitled to the rights and remedies of
third-party beneficiaries with respect to _Section 6.02_ and the Parent
Indemnified Parties and the Equityholder Indemnified Parties not party hereto
are entitled to the rights and remedies of third-party beneficiaries with
respect to _Article IX_.

SECTION 12.09 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably, and in a
manner for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the
Parties hereto agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court of the United States
or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter, in
addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in
equity.

controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed

State of Delaware.

(a) Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any California
State court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
California, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to the Transaction Documents delivered
in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each Party
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (a) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in such courts; (b) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
California State court or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, in such
Federal court; (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such California State
or Federal court; and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any such California State or Federal court. Each
Party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each Party hereto
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 12.02_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY

 



111   IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
12.11(b)_.

SECTION 12.12 _Cumulative Remedies_. Subject to _Section 9.10_, all rights
and remedies of the Parties hereto are cumulative of each other and of every
other right or remedy any such Party may otherwise have at law or in equity,
and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not prejudice or
impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies.

SECTION 12.13 _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party hereto represents and
agrees with each other that it has been represented by or had the opportunity
to be represented by, independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has
had the full right and opportunity to consult with its respective
attorney(s), that to the extent, if any, that it desired, it availed itself of
this right and opportunity, that it or its authorized officers (as the case
may be) have carefully read and fully understand this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents in their entirety and have had it fully explained to them
by such Partys respective counsel, that each is fully aware of the contents
thereof and its meaning, intent and legal effect, and that it or its
authorized officer (as the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement
and has executed this Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue influence.
The Parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement in connection with the Transactions, with the
opportunity to seek advice as to their legal rights from such counsel. In the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement is to be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties hereto and no
presumption or burden of proof is to arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or by reason of
the extent to which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft
hereof.

SECTION 12.14 _Execution and Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed an
original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be legally binding
upon the electronic transmission, including by facsimile or email, by each
Party of a signed signature page to this Agreement to the other Party.

 

SECTION 12.15 _Disclosure_. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty
made herein unless the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception
with particularity and describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail.

_[Signature Page Follows]_
