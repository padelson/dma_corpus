Acquired Companies are not direct subsidiaries of the Company as of the date of this Agreement.
Prior to the Closing, Quiksilver and its Affiliates intend to restructure the ownership of the
Acquired Companies to cause all of the Acquired Companies (other than the Company) to be direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the &#147;Restructuring&#148;). Quiksilver agrees to
discuss the details and timing of the Restructuring with Buyer, and consider in good faith any
adjustments to such Restructuring that Buyer may reasonably request in order to avoid any adverse
tax or accounting consequences to Buyer, or the Acquired Companies, including, without limitation,
adjusting the Restructuring plan such that the shares of one or more of such Acquired Companies are
not contributed or sold by Quiksilver (or its Affiliates) to the Company prior to Closing, but
instead are directly purchased by Buyer or one of its Affiliates at Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Quiksilver shall not be obligated to implement any of the suggested adjustments of Buyer
if such adjustments would have any negative effect or impact on Quiksilver or its Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Companies).

Huntington Beach, California; provided, however, that Quiksilver&#146;s failure to obtain such consent
shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Quiksilver will indemnify and hold Buyer and the Acquired Companies
harmless from any Damages that directly or indirectly result from or arise out of Quiksilver&#146;s
failure to obtain such consent.

Indemnified Persons (net of any costs and expenses

the insurance proceeds to Quiksilver. The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall use reasonable efforts
to obtain from any applicable insurance company any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim for
which the Buyer Indemnified Persons seek indemnification under this Article&nbsp;X. In addition, the
Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not have the right to indemnification for any individual breach

Twenty-Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($25,200,000) (the &#147;Seller Cap&#148;); provided,

payments and other compensation to which the party or its Affiliates is entitled from Persons other
than Quiksilver or Seller, in the case of Buyer, or other than Buyer, in the case of Quiksilver or
Seller, in respect of such matter. If any amount related to Damages is subsequently recovered by a
party, in whole or in part, from any third party (including any insurer or Taxing Authority) after
indemnification by the other party, the amounts so recovered shall be promptly reimbursed to the
party who provided such indemnification. Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

account of any net Tax Benefit realized by an indemnified party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Damage. If the indemnified party realizes any such Tax Benefit, then the
indemnified party shall pay an amount to the indemnitor, at the time such Tax Benefit is realized,
equal to the Tax Benefit, provided that in the event an amount payable by the indemnitor is reduced
by the amount of such Tax Benefit and there is a disallowance of such Tax Benefit by a Governmental
Body such that the indemnified party is not entitled to all or any portion of such Tax Benefit,
