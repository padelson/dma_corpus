 This Stock Purchase Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of October 30, 2007, by and among Quiksilver, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Quiksilver"), Rossignol Ski Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), Roger Cleveland Golf Company, Inc., a California corporation ("Company"), and SRI Sports Limited, a Japanese corporation ("Buyer"). For purposes of this Agreement, the terms set forth in _Exhibit A_ shall have the meanings specified or referred to therein. 

  

R E C I T A L S 

   

 A. Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (the "Shares"). 

  

 B. Buyer desires to purchase all of the Shares, and Seller desires to sell the Shares, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 _AGREEMENT_  

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follow: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES 

   

 1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller will sell and transfer to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase from Seller, the Shares, which shall constitute all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, in exchange for the Purchase Price. 

  

 1.2 _Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) The purchase price payable to Seller for the purchase and sale of the Shares (the "Purchase Price") shall be $132,500,000 less (a) the Remaining Offset Amount and (b) the aggregate amount of the Change in Control Obligations (the Purchase Price as so reduced, the "Closing Cash Amount"). The Purchase Price and the Closing Cash Amount shall be subject to further adjustment as required pursuant to Section 1.3. 

   

 (b) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Purchase Price has been determined on a cash free, debt-free basis and in furtherance thereof, agree that at the Closing, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions specified in Article VII, the following actions and payments shall be made in the following order: 

    

 (i) all amounts owed by Quiksilver or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) to any of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing (the "Intercompany Receivables") shall be offset against all amounts owed by any of the Acquired Companies to Quiksilver or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) as of the Closing, which shall include, without limitation (A) any accounts 

   ##### 

  

   

payable by any Acquired Company to Quiksilver or its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies) and (B) all indebtedness for borrowed money (and any
interest thereon) payable by any Acquired Company to Quiksilver or its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) (collectively, the
"Intercompany Payables and Debt"). The amount by which the
Intercompany Payables and Debt exceed the Intercompany Receivables shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Offset Amount"); 

   

 (ii) all Acquired Company Cash shall be used to pay the Offset Amount and any indebtedness for borrowed money, and interest thereon, owed to any Person other than Quiksilver and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) (the "Third-Party Debt"). The amount by which the sum of the Offset Amount and the Third-Party Debt exceeds the Acquired Company Cash shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Remaining Offset Amount"); 

   

 (iii) Buyer shall provide the Required Buyer Intercompany Loan and the Change in Control Obligation Loan to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company; 

   

 (iv) the Company shall pay the Remaining Offset Amount to the applicable Quiksilver Affiliate, as designated by Quiksilver, by wire transfer of immediately available funds; 

   

 (v) the Company shall pay the Change in Control Obligations to the applicable employees by wire transfer of immediately available funds; and 

   

 (vi) the Closing Cash Payment will be paid in accordance with Section 1.2(a). 

  

 1.3 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) On or before a date not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Quiksilver shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) an estimated consolidated balance sheet for the Acquired Companies as of 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet"), and (ii) a good faith estimate of the Company Working Capital as of the Closing (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"), certified by the Companys Chief Financial Officer as being (x) prepared in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications and estimation methodologies, as were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements, to the extent applicable and consistent with GAAP, (y) based on all information known to such Chief Financial Officer at such time and such other information then reasonably available to the Acquired Companies, Quiksilver or such Chief Financial Officer and (z) prepared after due inquiry of all personnel responsible for the preparation of financial information of the Acquired Companies in the ordinary course of business. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) On the Closing Date, (i) if the Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than $55.9 million, then the Purchase Price and Closing Cash Amount each shall be reduced by the dollar amount of such deficit or (ii) if the Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than $61.9 million, then the Purchase Price and Closing Cash Amount each shall be increased by the dollar amount of such excess, but in no event shall the Purchase Price and Closing Cash Amount be increased by more than $4.2 million. The Purchase Price shall be subject to further adjustment following the Closing in accordance with Section 1.3(h) below. 

   

 (c) Within the 45-day period immediately following the Closing Date, Quiksilver shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") and, (ii) a working capital statement (the "Closing Working Capital Statement") setting forth Buyers calculation of the Company Working Capital as of the Closing (the "Closing Working Capital"). Unless disputed by Buyer in accordance with Section 1.3(d), the amount of Closing Working Capital shown on the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be the final and binding Closing Working Capital amount (the "Final Closing Working Capital Amount"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet and, the Closing Working Capital Statement each will be certified by the Quiksilvers Chief Financial Officer as being prepared in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications and estimation methodologies, as were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements, to the extent applicable and consistent with GAAP, and will not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Closing Working Capital will be calculated in a manner consistent with the calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital in Section 1.3(a) above. In connection with the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and, Closing Working Capital Statement and, in the event that Quiksilver is required to include information regarding any of the Acquired Companies in its financial statements or otherwise in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buyer shall provide Quiksilver with reasonable access to all relevant books and records and personnel of the Acquired Companies; provided, that such access shall be upon prior written notice to Buyer, shall be during normal business hours and shall, to the extent reasonably possible, not disrupt the operations of the Acquired Companies. 

   

 (d) In the event that Buyer disputes the Closing Working Capital shown on the Closing Working Capital Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Quiksilver, within forty-five (45) days after receiving the Closing Working Capital Statement, a written notice of what Buyer believes is the correct Closing Working Capital (the "Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the component or components which are in dispute and the basis of such dispute. 

   

 (e) Buyer and Quiksilver shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement set forth in the Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after Buyer has delivered the Dispute Notice to Buyer. If the parties resolve such dispute, then the Closing Working Capital agreed to by the parties shall be deemed, respectively, to be the Final Closing Working Capital Amount. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) If the parties do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after Buyer has delivered the Dispute Notice to Quiksilver, unless the parties mutually agree to continue their efforts to resolve such differences, then such disagreements shall immediately be submitted for final and binding resolution to Ernst and Young, LLP to resolve such disagreements (the "Neutral Accountants") in the manner provided below. Each of the parties shall make available to the Neutral Accountants all work papers and all other information and material in their possession relating to the matters in the Dispute Notice. Each party shall be permitted to present supporting materials to the Neutral Accountants (which supporting materials shall also be concurrently provided to the other party) within ten (10) Business Days of the submission of the dispute to the Neutral Accountants. Within five (5) Business Days of receipt of supporting materials, the receiving party may present responsive materials to the Neutral Accountants (which responsive materials shall also be concurrently provided to the other party). Each party may make an oral presentation to the Neutral Accountants (in which case, such presenting party shall notify the other party of such presentation, and the other party shall have the right to be present at such presentation) within twenty (20) Business Days of the submission of the dispute to the Neutral Accountants. In determining those items and amounts disputed by the parties in the Dispute Notice, the Neutral Accountants shall only consider the materials and oral presentations of the parties and those items and amounts set forth in the Dispute Notice as to which Buyer and Quiksilver have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified in this Section 1.3, and shall not conduct any independent review. The Neutral Accountants shall make their determinations within sixty (60) days of submission of the dispute to them. Such determinations by the Neutral Accountants shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize or permit the Neutral Accountants (i) to determine any questions or matters whatsoever under or in connection with this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein, or (ii) to apply any accounting methods, treatments, principles or procedures with respect to disputes under this Section 1.3 other than as described in this Section 1.3. If any dispute is submitted to the Neutral Accountants pursuant to this Section 1.3, the Final Closing Working Capital Amount shall not be finally determined until the Neutral Accountants have issued their final determination under this Section 1.3(f). 

   

 (g) The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountants shall be shared equally by Quiksilver and Buyer. 

   

 (h) Upon final determination of the Final Closing Working Capital Amount, (i) if the Final Closing Working Capital Amount is less than $55.9 million, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the dollar amount of such deficit or (ii) if the Final Closing Working Capital Amount is greater than $61.9 million, then the Purchase Price shall be increased by the dollar amount of such excess, in each case taking into account any adjustment previously made pursuant to Section 1.3(b), but in no event shall the Purchase Price be increased pursuant to this Section 1.3(h) by more than the sum of $4.2 million plus the amount of any previous Purchase Price decrease pursuant to Section 1.3(b). Such adjustment amount (after taking into account any adjustment previously made to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3(b)) shall be paid by Seller to Buyer, in the case of a reduction to the Purchase Price, or by Buyer to Seller, in the case of an increase in the Purchase Price, within three (3) Business Days of the final determination of the Final Closing Working Capital Amount in immediately available funds to an account designated by the recipient. 

    ##### 

  

     

 1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares provided for in this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place, unless this Agreement has been previously terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, at the offices of Quiksilvers counsel at 19900 MacArthur Boulevard, Suite 1050, Irvine, California 92612 at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on a mutually agreed date within five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law and this Agreement) waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles VII and VIII (other than those conditions to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), or at such other time and place as the parties may agree. The effective time of the Closing shall be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the Closing Date. Subject to the provisions of Article IX, failure to consummate the purchase and sale of the Shares provided for in this Agreement on the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.4 will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this Agreement. 

  

 1.5 _Closing Obligations_. At the Closing:

 (a) Buyer has available to it, and on the Closing Date will have, funds in an amount sufficient to enable it (i) to consummate all the transactions contemplated herein, without any delay or restriction that would adversely impact the certainty of Buyers ability to so consummate, and (ii) pay all fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with such transactions. 

   

 (b) Buyer has delivered to Quiksilver true and complete copies of all equity and debt commitments for financing to be used to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and there are no other arrangements or agreements that in any way condition, restrict, impair or limit such financing (such as material adverse change, due diligence, delivery of legal opinions or contracts, or other specific conditions to drawing that are not within Buyers sole control). Each such commitment is valid, binding and in full force and effect. Each debt financing is extended by one or more lending institutions having at least a Standard and Poors long term issue rating of "A-" or a Moodys equivalent rating. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute an event of default on the part of Buyer under the equity or debt financing documents that has not been waived or remedied to the satisfaction of the lenders or the equity investors. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees on the dates and to the extent required by the equity or debt financing documents. 

   

 3.4 _Certain Proceedings_. There is no pending Proceeding that has been commenced against Buyer and that challenges, or may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of the transactions contemplated herein. To the Knowledge of Buyer, no such Proceeding has been Threatened. 

  

 3.5 _Investment Intent; Ability to Evaluate and Bear Risks_. Buyer is acquiring the Shares for its own account and not with a view to their distribution within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act. Buyer is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Shares for an indefinite period, and has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters such that it is capable of evaluating the risks of the investment in the Shares. 

  

 3.6 _Investigation by Buyer; Quiksilver s and Sellers Liability_. Buyer has conducted its own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Acquired Companies, which investigation, review and analysis was done by Buyer and, to the extent Buyer deemed 

   ##### 

  

 

appropriate, by its representatives. None of the findings of Buyer, however,
or the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis shall diminish or in
any way detract from or affect Buyers ability to rely on or make a claim for
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Article II of this
Agreement. In entering into this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that it
has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis
and not on any factual representations, warranties or assurances of
Quiksilver, Seller, the Acquired Companies or their respective
representatives (except the specific representations and warranties of
Quiksilver set forth in Article II of this Agreement), and Buyer: 

   

 (a) acknowledges that none of Quiksilver, Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, stockholders, employees, Affiliates, agents, advisors or representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information (including the Due Diligence Information) provided or made available to Buyer or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons, agents or representatives; and 

   

 (b) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that none of Quiksilver, Seller, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, Affiliates, agents, advisors or representatives shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to Buyer or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons, agents or representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort) based upon any information provided or made available, or statements made (including in materials furnished in the Due Diligence Information), to Buyer or its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, controlling persons, advisors, agents or representatives (or any omissions therefrom), including in respect of the specific representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement, except that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to (i) Quiksilver or Seller insofar as Quiksilver makes the specific representations and warranties set forth in Article II of this Agreement, but subject to the limitations and restrictions contained in Article X, or (ii) to the extent arising from fraud or intentional misrepresentation. 

   

 3.7 _Brokers or Finders_. Buyer and its officers and agents have incurred no obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or other similar payment in connection with this Agreement other than fees owed to Daiwa Securities SMBC. Buyer will indemnify and hold Quiksilver and Seller harmless from any such payment alleged to be due by or through Buyer.

 COVENANTS OF QUIKSILVER, SELLER AND COMPANY 
 PRIOR TO CLOSING DATE 

   

 4.1 _Access and Investigation_. 

  

 (a) Subject to any Legal Requirement, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Quiksilver, Seller and the Company will, and will cause each Acquired Company and its representatives to, (a) afford Buyer and its representatives and prospective lenders and their representatives (collectively, "Buyers Advisors") reasonable access during normal business hours to each Acquired Companys personnel, properties, contracts, books and records, and other documents and data, (b) furnish Buyer and Buyers Advisors with copies of all such contracts, books and

records, and other existing documents and data as Buyer may reasonably

financial, operating, and other data and information as Buyer may reasonably
request, in each case, so long as such actions (1) do not materially
interfere with the business of the Acquired Companies and (2) would not

Company agree that Buyer shall be permitted (at Buyers sole cost and
expense) to have a Phase I environmental study conducted at the Companys
premises located on the NWC of Skylab Road and Astronautics Drive, Huntington
Beach, California, and agree to provide all reasonable cooperation in
connection therewith. 

   

 (b) Buyer agrees that neither Quiksilver, Seller nor the Company shall be deemed to have Knowledge of any actual or potential environmental Liabilities identified as a result of the Phase I environmental study conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) above, to the extent that such environmental Liabilities were not otherwise included within the knowledge of Quiksilver prior to the commencement of such Phase 1 environmental study.

 4.4 _Notification_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Quiksilver will notify Buyer as soon as practicable in writing if Quiksilver becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a Breach of any of Quiksilvers representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement. During the same period, Quiksilver will notify 

   ##### 

  

 

Buyer as soon as practicable of the occurrence of any Breach of any covenant
of Quiksilver, Seller or Company in this Article IV or of the occurrence of
any event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in Article VII
impossible or unlikely. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
notice provided pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice, or the
representations or warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations of,
the parties hereto. 

   

 4.5 _Antitrust Filings_. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event, within twenty (20) days after the date hereof), Quiksilver will, in cooperation with Buyer, complete and file with the appropriate authorities all forms and documents required under any antitrust or competition laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction (including foreign jurisdictions) (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), including, without limitation, the pre-merger notification forms and any other documents required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "HSR Act"). It is agreed that Buyer and Quiksilver shall bear equally all filing fees due from the parties in connection with compliance with Antitrust Laws. 

  

 4.6 _Required Approvals_. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Quiksilver, Seller and the Company will, and will cause each Acquired Company to, (a) make all filings required by Legal Requirements (including, without limitation, such requirements in connection with the HSR Act, other Antitrust Laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction) to be made by them in order to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, and (b) make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents required to be obtained by any Acquired Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 4.7 _Charges, Fees and Prepayment Obligations; Guarantees_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Seller and Quiksilver will take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that (a) no sums are owed or payable by the Acquired Companies following the Closing to any Person in the nature of a transfer charge, consent fee or processing fee with respect to any Contracts of the Acquired Companies, and (b) all guarantees of an Acquired Company for the benefit of Quiksilver or any of its Affiliates (that is not an Acquired Company) shall be removed. 

  

 4.8 _Consultations and Communications Regarding Employee Matters_. Quiksilver, Company and Seller will cooperate with Buyer with respect to any required notification to or consultation with any Governmental Bodies, labor organizations, Work Councils or similar such bodies in connection with employee, labor or other matters.

Quiksilver and Seller agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain releases of the Acquired Companies, effective as of the Closing, from each of the individuals listed in _Exhibit C_; provided, however, that 

   ##### 

  

 

Quiksilvers failure to obtain such releases despite using its
commercially reasonable efforts shall not be deemed a breach of this
Agreement. 

   

 4.9 _Transfer of Certain Intellectual Property_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Quiksilver will take all actions reasonably necessary to transfer the "VAS" patents and the "Cleveland Golf" trademarks in France held by Quiksilver or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) to the Acquired Companies. 

  

 4.10 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Quiksilver, Seller and the Company will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions in Articles VII and VIII to be satisfied. 

  

 4.11 _Acquired Company Restructuring_. The parties acknowledge and agree that certain of the Acquired Companies are not direct subsidiaries of the Company as of the date of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Quiksilver and its Affiliates intend to restructure the ownership of the Acquired Companies to cause all of the Acquired Companies (other than the Company) to be direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the "Restructuring"). Quiksilver agrees to discuss the details and timing of the Restructuring with Buyer, and consider in good faith any adjustments to such Restructuring that Buyer may reasonably request in order to avoid any adverse tax or accounting consequences to Buyer, or the Acquired Companies, including, without limitation, adjusting the Restructuring plan such that the shares of one or more of such Acquired Companies are not contributed or sold by Quiksilver (or its Affiliates) to the Company prior to Closing, but instead are directly purchased by Buyer or one of its Affiliates at Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Quiksilver shall not be obligated to implement any of the suggested adjustments of Buyer if such adjustments would have any negative effect or impact on Quiksilver or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies). 

  

 4.12 _Accounting Treatment_. Quiksilver agrees that it will treat the payment of the Change in Control Obligations as an expense incurred immediately prior to Closing for purposes of its financial reporting. 

  

 4.13 _Consent of Landlord for Company Headquarters_. Quiksilver will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the landlord to the Companys headquarters facility in Huntington Beach, California; provided, however, that Quiksilvers failure to obtain such consent shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Quiksilver will indemnify and hold Buyer and the Acquired Companies harmless from any Damages that directly or indirectly result from or arise out of Quiksilvers failure to obtain such consent.

ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 6.1 _Tax Returns and Transfer Taxes_. 

  

 (a) _Quiksilver s Consolidated Income Tax Returns_. Quiksilver shall, at its own expense, prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns) of the Acquired Companies that are income Tax Returns and are prepared on a consolidated, unitary, or combined basis and that include Quiksilver for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Any Tax Returns prepared by Quiksilver for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing (including any amended Tax Returns) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (except as required by Legal Requirements) during the taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing. Quiksilver shall timely pay, or cause to be paid, any such Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. 

   

 (b) _Other Returns_. Buyer shall, at its own expense, prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies (other than the Tax Returns that are prepared by Quiksilver pursuant to Section 6.1(a) above) that are required to be filed 

    

35 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

after the Closing with respect to taxable periods beginning on or before the
Closing Date or any period commencing after the Closing, and, subject to the
right to payment from Quiksilver pursuant to this Section, Buyer shall pay
all Taxes shown as due on those Tax Returns. Quiksilver shall reimburse Buyer
for all Taxes shown on Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies (other than the
Tax Returns that are prepared by Quiksilver pursuant to Section 6.1(a) above)
for all periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date
which are filed after the Closing Date, but Quiksilver shall be credited for
any estimated tax payments made by it prior to Closing. For Tax periods which
begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"), Quiksilver shall reimburse Buyer for an amount equal to the Pre-
Closing Taxes due with respect to any such Tax Returns filed by the Acquired
Companies and payable by such Acquired Companies. Quiksilver shall also
reimburse Buyer for all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns of
the Acquired Companies for any taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and for a pro rata share of any Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies for a Straddle Period. Any amounts owed by Quiksilver to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) shall be paid by Quiksilver within ten
(10) days of Buyers request therefor. Buyer shall cause each Acquired
Company to timely pay all such Taxes on or prior to their due date. With
respect to a Straddle Period, such Pre-Closing Taxes shall be calculated as
follows: For purposes of this Section 6.1(b), in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period,
the portion of such Taxes that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes
other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
from the first day of the Straddle Period through and including the Closing
Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (B) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if
the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date, using the "closing of
the books" method of accounting. 

   

 (c) _Amended Returns_. Unless required by Legal Requirements, Buyer shall not (nor shall it cause or permit the Acquired Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Acquired Companies with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date, or that includes the Closing Date, without the prior written Consent of Quiksilver, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) _Tax Proceedings_. In the event Buyer receives notice of any pending or Threatened Tax audits or assessments by any Tax authority or other disputes concerning Taxes with respect to which Quiksilver or its Affiliates may incur Liability under this Agreement, the party in receipt of such notice shall promptly notify Quiksilver of such matter in writing. Quiksilver shall have the right, at its own expense, to represent the interests of the Acquired Companies in any such Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding to the extent relating to Taxes for which Quiksilver is liable under this Agreement. 

   

 (e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Acquired Companies, and Quiksilver shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of all Tax Returns (including any amended Tax Return or claim for refund) and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Buyer and 

    ##### 

  

    

Quiksilver further agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed. 

   

 (f) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements, if any, between any of the Acquired Companies and any other Affiliate of Quiksilver shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing, none of the Acquired Companies, nor Quiksilver, nor any Affiliate thereof, shall be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder and no payments (or any other obligations) that are owed by or to the Acquired Companies pursuant thereto shall be required to be made (or performed) thereunder. 

   

 (g) _Transfer Taxes_. Quiksilver shall be responsible for and shall pay for all stock transfer Taxes, sales Taxes, documentary stamp Taxes, recording charges and other similar Taxes, if any, arising in connection with the sale of the Shares to Buyer. Each of the parties hereto shall prepare and file, and shall fully cooperate with each other party with respect to the preparation and filing of, any Tax Returns and other filings relating to any such Taxes or charges as may be required. 

   

 6.2 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of Company_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees that it will, and it will cause each Acquired Company to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of an Acquired Company (the "DandO Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under its Organizational Documents and any indemnification agreements or arrangements in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such DandO Indemnified Parties subject to applicable Legal Requirements. 

   

 (b) In the event that an Acquired Company or Buyer or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or Buyer will assume the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.2. 

   

 6.3 _Other Intercompany Arrangements_. Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, all Contracts, whether written, oral or otherwise, which are solely between the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Quiksilver, Seller and their Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies), on the other hand, shall be terminated and of no further effect, simultaneously with the Closing without any further action or liability on the part of the parties thereto, including, without limitation, any promissory notes and interest bearing liabilities. Quiksilver and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) agree that, after the Closing, 

   ##### 

  

 

no Acquired Company sponsored athlete shall be required to use or wear any
FIDRA apparel or item. 

   

 6.4 _Excluded Insurance Policies; Continued Product Liability Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies after the Closing) not to, assert, by way of claim, action, litigation or otherwise, any right to any Excluded Insurance Policy or any benefit under any such Excluded Insurance Policy. Quiksilver and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Excluded Insurance Policies, including the right to any credit or return premiums due, paid or payable in connection with the termination thereof; provided, however, that to the extent any returned premiums have been paid by an Acquired Company, such returned premiums shall belong to Buyer. 

   

 (b) Promptly upon the Closing and except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall release, and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies, to release, all rights to all Excluded Insurance Policies that covered the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date. All Excluded Insurance Policies issued prior to the Closing Date in the name of or to the Acquired Companies shall remain with Quiksilver or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if any Insurance Policy (including any Excluded Insurance Policy) is occurrence-based and provides coverage to an Acquired Company, or (ii) provides coverage to an Acquired Company in respect of an outstanding insurance claim, then the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the benefits of such coverage to the applicable Acquired Companies. In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing, Quiksilver shall and shall cause its Affiliates to (in each case, promptly upon the request of Buyer): (i) provide copies of any Excluded Insurance Policy to Buyer for the sole purposes of determining whether a potential claim may be covered thereunder, (ii) to the extent Buyer reasonably believes such potential claim would be covered under an Excluded Insurance Policy, submit such claim to the applicable insurance company and take all reasonable action to have such claim promptly processed; (iii) upon receipt by Quiksilver or its Affiliates of any proceeds received pursuant to an Excluded Insurance Policy in connection with the foregoing, remit such proceeds to the applicable Acquired Company within five (5) Business Days; and (iv) otherwise keep Buyer reasonably informed, and take any other action as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, in respect of the foregoing. 

   

 (c) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Quiksilver agrees to maintain product liability insurance coverage for the benefit of the Acquired Companies (where the Acquired Companies are named beneficiaries under the Policy) in respect of products that were manufactured by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date (the "Policy"). Buyer agrees to pay Quiksilver $75,000 to maintain such Policy. For avoidance of doubt, Quiksilvers obligations pursuant to Section 6.4(b) shall apply to the Policy. 

   

 6.5 _Settlement and General Release of the Buyer Released Parties_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, for the consideration set forth herein and for other due and valid consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Quiksilver and its Affiliates, to the extent acting in the capacity of an Affiliate, (collectively, 

    ##### 

  

    

"Seller Affiliates") waive and finally release and forever discharge Buyer,
the Acquired Companies and each of Buyers Affiliates, to the extent acting
in the capacity of an Affiliate, (collectively, the "Buyer Released Parties")
from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, debts, liabilities,
obligations, costs and expenditures of any kind and nature
whatsoever, whether liquidated or contingent, known or unknown, which the
Seller Affiliates may now have or may have had the right to assert against
any of the Buyer Released Persons under any Contract between or among any
Seller Affiliate and any Acquired Company, or pursuant to any action or
failure to act by any of the Acquired Companies, in each case based on any
matter, fact or event that occurred or existed on or prior to the Closing
Date (collectively, the "Released Claims"); provided, however that the
Released Claims will not include any rights arising under this Agreement. 

   

 (b) From and after the Closing, Seller Affiliates and their successors and assigns, covenant not to sue or otherwise institute or cause to be instituted or in any way participate in any legal, administrative or other proceeding or action, in the United States or any foreign country, against any of the Buyer Released Parties with respect to any matter of any kind arising out of the Released Claims. 

   

 (c) Each of Quiksilver and Seller has entered into this Agreement based on its own investigation and analysis and that of its attorneys and other advisors and expressly assumes the risk that facts may be unknown to or not understood by it. On entering into this release, neither Quiksilver nor Seller is relying upon any representation or warranty of Buyer or its agents or representatives other than as set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Each of Quiksilver and Seller acknowledges that this waiver and release extends to all claims of every nature and kind, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, past, present or future, whether under foreign, federal, state or local law, arising from the Released Claims, and any and all rights granted to them under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code or any analogous law or rule of any country other than the U.S. or U.S. state law or federal law or regulation are hereby expressly waived. Said Section 1542 of the California Civil Code reads as follows: 

    

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH
IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE
DEBTOR." 

  

 This Section 6.5 shall constitute a complete defense to any claim released herein and shall survive indefinitely, without restriction, qualification or limitation, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary. 

  

 6.6 _Litigation Support_. So long as any party actively is contesting or defending against any Proceeding in connection with (a) the transactions contemplated hereby or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving any Acquired Company, each other party will cooperate with such party and such partys counsel in 

   ##### 

  

 

the contest or defense, make available their personnel, and provide such
testimony and access to their books and records as will be reasonably
necessary in connection with the contest or defense, at the sole cost and
expense of the contesting or defending party (subject to any indemnification
rights under Article X). 

   

 6.7 _Transition Services_. 

  

 (a) Commencing on the Closing Date, Quiksilver shall provide, either directly or through its Affiliates, to the Acquired Companies the Transition Services (as such term is defined below) for a period of no longer than twelve (12) months immediately following the Closing, unless a Transition Service is earlier terminated in accordance with the terms hereof. 

   

 (b) Quiksilver agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Transition Services in substantially the same manner and at substantially the same level as such Transition Services were performed by Quiksilver and/or its Affiliates for the Business prior to the date hereof. Quiksilver shall give the Transition Services substantially the same priority as it accords its own operations. The Buyer may terminate any Transition Service by giving five (5) days prior written notice to Quiksilver. Any requested termination of a Transition Service pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall become effective at the end of such five (5) day notice period and Quiksilver and/or its Affiliates shall thereafter no longer be obligated to provide such Transition Service and the Buyer shall thereafter no longer be obligated to pay for such Transition Service. Any such termination of a particular Transition Service shall not affect Quiksilvers obligation to provide any other Transition Service pursuant to this Section 6.7 that has not been so terminated. Furthermore, the parties agree to fully cooperate in good faith with each other in connection with the provision of the Transition Services and the matters related to or arising hereunder, including, without limitation, Quiksilvers cooperation with the Acquired Companies to enable the Acquired Companies to establish their own infrastructure to perform the Transition Services independently of Quiksilver as soon as practicable after the Closing. 

   

 (c) All Transition Services shall be provided by Quiksilver or its Affiliates at a cost equal to Quiksilvers or its Affiliates costs for such items which shall be paid by Buyer on a monthly basis. Quiksilver and its Affiliates hereby agree that neither shall include a profit component in its charge for any Transition Service. 

   

 (d) Quiksilver shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Companies and their representatives and Affiliates from and against all Damages incurred or sustained by any Acquired Company where such Damages results from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of, Quiksilver, its representatives, Affiliates or any third party performing Transition Services on behalf of Quiksilver, or (ii) the failure by Quiksilver to comply fully with its obligations to any Quiksilver or Affiliate employee or consultant, including, without limitation, payment of wages, provision of benefits, and payment of employment taxes. Quiksilver warrants that all Transition Services shall be performed in compliance with all Legal Requirements and agree to promptly correct any errors or omissions that arise in connection with the provision of the Transition Services.

Buyer hereby agrees to assume the automobile lease agreements utilized by Acquired Company employees prior to the date hereof that have been executed by a Quiksilver Affiliate. A list of such leases are set forth in the Disclosure Letter in Section 2.16(a).

 (a) by Quiksilver if a material Breach of any provision of this Agreement has been committed by Buyer which (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 and (ii) is not cured, or cannot be cured, in all material respects within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof; provided, however, that Quiksilvers right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(a) shall not be available if, at the time of such intended termination, Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 9.1(b) or (c); 

   

 (b) by Buyer if a material Breach of any provision of this Agreement has been committed by (i) Quiksilver, (ii) Seller or (iii) the Company which (A) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2 and (B) is not cured, or cannot be cured, in all material respects within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof; provided, however, Buyers right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available if, at the time of such intended termination, Quiksilver has the right to terminate this Agreement under Sections 9.1(a) or 9.1(c); 

    #####

 (d) by mutual consent of Quiksilver and Buyer. 

   

 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. Each partys right of termination under Section 9.1 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations in Sections 11.1, 11.3, 11.5 and 11.13 will survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a party because of the Breach of the Agreement by the other party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating partys obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other partys failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired. 

  

ARTICLE X 
 INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES 

   

 10.1 _Survival; Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge_. All representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations in this Agreement and any certificate or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing, except those of the Company, which shall terminate upon the Closing. 

  

 10.2 _Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Quiksilver_. Quiksilver will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its representatives, stockholders and Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Persons") for, and will pay to the Buyer Indemnified Persons the amount of, any loss, liability, disbursements, deficiency, penalty, judgment, settlement, claim, damage, expense (including reasonable costs of investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively, "Damages"), arising directly or indirectly from (a) any Breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article II (it being understood that, in determining the amount of Damages under this Section 10.2 from any breach of any representation or warranty, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach, all references to "material" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be deleted therefrom), (b) any Breach by Quiksilver, Seller or the Company of any covenant or obligation of Quiksilver, Seller or Company in this Agreement, or (c) Pre-Closing Taxes. 

  

 10.3 _Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Buyer_. Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Quiksilver, Seller, the Company and their respective representatives, stockholders and Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons"), and will pay to Quiksilver the amount of any Damages arising directly or indirectly from (a) any Breach of any representation 

   ##### 

  

 

or warranty contained in Article III (it being understood that, in determining
the amount of Damages under this Section 10.3 from any breach of any
representation or warranty, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes
of determining whether there has been a breach, all references to
"material" shall be deleted therefrom), or (b) any Breach by Buyer of any
covenant or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement. 

   

 10.4 _Time Limitations_. If the Closing occurs, neither Quiksilver nor Seller will have any Liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to any representation or warranty under Article II or any covenant or obligation required by this Agreement to be performed on or prior to Closing, other than those in Sections 2.1, 2.2(a), 2.3, 2.11, 2.18 and 2.23, unless within eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date Buyer notifies Quiksilver in writing of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Buyer; a claim with respect to Sections 2.1, 2.2(a), 2.3, 2.18 or 2.23 may be made at any time; and a claim with respect to Section 2.11 may be made at any time until all Tax liabilities of the Acquired Companies are decided by final determination of the Internal Revenue Service, judicial decision or upon thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations, taking into account any waiver or extension of such applicable statute of limitation; The time limitations set forth in this Section 10.4 are expressly intended to shorten the statute of limitations which would otherwise be applicable to a claim by Buyer against Quiksilver or Seller under this Agreement. 

  

 10.5 _Limitations on Amount Quiksilver, Seller and Company_. Neither Quiksilver, Seller nor Company will have any Liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the matters described in Section 10.2(a) or, to the extent relating to any failure to perform or comply prior to the Closing Date, Section 10.2(b) until the total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Seller Basket"), in which event, the right to be indemnified shall apply to the full amount of such Damages, including the Seller Basket. The obligation of Quiksilver to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be reduced to the extent that insurance proceeds in respect of the applicable indemnification claim have been actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Persons (net of any costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance proceeds). If Quiksilver pays the Buyer Indemnified Persons for an indemnification claim and subsequently insurance proceeds in respect of such claim are collected by the Buyer Indemnified Persons, then the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall promptly remit the insurance proceeds to Quiksilver. The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall use reasonable efforts to obtain from any applicable insurance company any insurance proceeds in respect of any claim for which the Buyer Indemnified Persons seek indemnification under this Article X. In addition, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not have the right to indemnification for any individual breach pursuant to Section 10.2(a) resulting in Damages which are equal to or less than $50,000 (for the avoidance of doubt, all Damages that arise out of the same or related matter, fact, circumstance or event shall be aggregated together for purposes of determining whether the $50,000 and $1,000,000 thresholds are satisfied pursuant to this Section 10.5). Furthermore, any liability of Quiksilver, Seller or the Company hereunder (for indemnification or otherwise) shall terminate at such time as the aggregate amount of Damages paid to Buyer by Quiksilver, Seller or the Company equals Twenty-Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($25,200,000) (the "Seller Cap"); provided, however, that in no event shall the Seller Basket or the Seller Cap apply to or limit the rights of the Buyer Indemnified Persons to be indemnified (i) pursuant to Section 10.2(a) for breaches of representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.1, 2.2(a), 2.3, 2.11, 2.18 or 2.23, (ii) pursuant to Section 10.2(b) for any breach of Section 6.7, (iii) for Pre-

##### 

 

  

Closing Taxes, or (iv) for claims by the Buyer Indemnified Persons against
Quiksilver, Seller or the Company based on fraud or knowing, willful or
intentional breaches of this Agreement. None of the findings of Buyer or its
investigation, review and analysis of the Acquired Companies shall diminish
or in any way detract from or affect Buyers ability to rely on or make a
claim for breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Article
II of this Agreement. 

   

 10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the indemnities provided in this Article X shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of any Indemnified Party for Damages arising out of, resulting from or incurred in connection with the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the parties in this Agreement; provided, however; that this exclusive remedy for Damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action for specific performance or other equitable remedy to require a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, no legal action sounding in tort, statute or strict liability may be maintained by any party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.6, in the event of fraud, or a fraudulent, knowing, willful or intentional breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein by Quiksilver, Seller or Company, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have all remedies available at law or in equity (including for tort) with respect thereto. 

  

 10.7 _Procedure for Indemnification Third Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Sections 10.2 or 10.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnified partys failure to give such notice. 

  

 (b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.7(a) is brought against an indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this Article X for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified partys consent (such consent to not be unreasonably 

   ##### 

  

 

withheld) unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of
Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect
on any other claims that may be made against the indemnified party, and (B)
the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnified party will have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its
consent; and (iv) such compromise or settlement includes as an unconditional
term thereof, the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the indemnified
party a release from all liability in respect of such indemnifiable claim. If
notice is given to an indemnifying party of the commencement of any Proceeding
and the indemnifying party does not, within thirty (30) days after the
indemnified partys notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of
its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party
will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise
or settlement effected by the indemnified party. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 10.8 _Procedure for Indemnification Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be asserted by written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought. 

  

 10.9 _Interpretation_. Damages shall be determined net of insurance proceeds, indemnity payments and other compensation to which the party or its Affiliates is entitled from Persons other than Quiksilver or Seller, in the case of Buyer, or other than Buyer, in the case of Quiksilver or Seller, in respect of such matter. If any amount related to Damages is subsequently recovered by a party, in whole or in part, from any third party (including any insurer or Taxing Authority) after indemnification by the other party, the amounts so recovered shall be promptly reimbursed to the party who provided such indemnification. Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

  

 10.10 _Tax Benefits_. 

  

 (a) The amount of any Damage for which indemnification is provided shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax Benefit realized by an indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damage. If the indemnified party realizes any such Tax Benefit, then the indemnified party shall pay an amount to the indemnitor, at the time such Tax Benefit is realized, equal to the Tax Benefit, provided that in the event an amount payable by the indemnitor is reduced by the amount of such Tax Benefit and there is a disallowance of such Tax Benefit by a Governmental Body such that the indemnified party is not entitled to all or any portion of such Tax Benefit, then the indemnitor shall pay to the indemnified party the amount of 

   ##### 

  

 

the Tax Benefit that was disallowed. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Tax Benefit" shall mean the amount of the reduction in the liability for
Taxes as a result of the payment or accrual by any Person of any loss,
expense, other amount or Tax. In computing the amount of any such Tax
Benefit, the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising
from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or
payment of any indemnified Damage. A Tax Benefit will be considered to be
realized for purposes of this Section 10.10 on (a) the date on which the Tax
Benefit is received as a refund of Taxes, or (b) to the extent that the Tax
Benefit is not received as a refund of Taxes but rather is claimed as an item
that reduces liability for Taxes, the due date of the Tax Return that
reflects such change in liability for Taxes. 

   

 (b) Any indemnification payments made hereunder shall be considered, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. In the event that any such payment does not constitute an adjustment to Purchase Price under any Tax law, the amount of such payment shall be grossed up to account for the amount of Tax due with respect to such payment, such that the recipient receives from the indemnifying party the full amount of the payment to which the recipient is entitled, net of any Taxes due with respect to such payment. 

  

 10.11 _No Environmental Contribution_. The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be able to seek contribution from Quiksilver or any of its Affiliates under any requirements of or obligations imposed by any Environmental Laws and hereby waive all statutory rights against Quiksilver and each of its affiliates under the Environmental Laws; provided, this shall not limit in any manner the right of the Buyer Indemnified Persons to seek and obtain indemnification pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE XI

Without limiting the foregoing, Quiksilver and Seller shall not at any time after the Closing directly or indirectly make use of or, except to the extent required by Legal Requirements, divulge or otherwise disclose directly or indirectly, to any Person other than Buyer, any of the Acquired Companies customer lists, database information, business model, business plan, marketing plan, personnel information, technical data, record or financial information, or any other proprietary or confidential information.

 11.7 _Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement. 

  

 11.8 _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in part at any time prior to the Closing Date by an agreement in writing between Buyer and Quiksilver. 

  

 11.9 _Disclosure Letter_. The disclosures in the Disclosure Letter relate to the representations and warranties in the Section of the Agreement to which they expressly relate and to other representations or warranties in this Agreement, to the extent that such other representation and warranty would reasonably be expected to be pertinent to the disclosures made. Quiksilver may deliver an updated Disclosure Letter (the "Updated Disclosure Letter") to Buyer immediately prior to the Closing updating the Disclosure Letter through the Closing. Quiksilver understands and agrees that the Updated Disclosure Letter shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether any breach of a representation or warranty has occurred pursuant to Article II and Buyers indemnification rights pursuant to Section 10.2(a) shall be determined as if no Updated Disclosure Letter was delivered. 

  

 11.10 _Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights_. No party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of the other parties, which will not be unreasonably withheld, except that Buyer may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer provided that Buyer shall remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns. 

  

 11.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full 

   ##### 

  

 

force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to
the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. 

   

 11.12 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. 

  

 11.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes between the parties under or related to this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws principles. 

  

 11.14 _Equitable Remedies_. In addition to legal remedies, to the extent allowed pursuant to this Agreement or by law, in recognition of the fact that remedies at law may not be sufficient, the parties hereto (and their successors) shall be entitled to equitable remedies including, without limitation, specific performance and injunction. 

  

 11.15 _Independence of Agreements, Covenants, Representations and Warranties_. All agreements and covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a certain action or condition constitutes a default under a certain agreement or covenant, the fact that such action or condition is permitted by another agreement or covenant shall not affect the occurrence of such default, unless expressly permitted under an exception to such first agreement or covenant. In addition, all representations and warranties hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular representation or warranty proves to be incorrect or is breached, the fact that another representation or warranty concerning the same or similar subject matter is correct or is not breached will not affect the incorrectness of or a breach of a representation and warranty hereunder. 

  

 11.16 _Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission, or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or e-mail signature page were an original thereof. 

  

 11.17 _Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters_. 

  

 (a) Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation shall apply: 

   

 (i) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which, any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded.

  (d)  |   | The Documents have each been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by each of Quiksilver, Rossignol and the Company. The Documents
constitute valid and binding obligations of each of Quiksilver, Rossignol and
the Company enforceable against each of Quiksilver, Rossignol and the Company
in accordance with their respective terms.

other action by, any governmental entity is required on the part of any of

performance by any of Quiksilver, Rossignol or the Company of the Documents,
or if required, such registration has been made, such consent or approval has
been obtained, such notice has been given or such other appropriate action
has been taken.
